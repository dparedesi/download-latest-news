May 16, 2025 07:02 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 16 May 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced changes to its executive leadership and Board of Directors. As per mutual agreement with the Novo Nordisk Board, Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen will step down from his role as CEO of Novo Nordisk. He will continue as CEO for a period to support a smooth transition to new leadership. A search for Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen’s successor is ongoing, and an announcement will be made in due course. In connection with the change, Lars Rebien Sørensen, chair of the Novo Nordisk Foundation, will join the Novo Nordisk Board, initially as an observer. Novo Nordisk has been through a significant growth journey and transformation led by Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen. During his eight-year tenure as CEO, Novo Nordisk’s sales, profits and share price have almost tripled. Novo Nordisk has a clear strategy, a strong product portfolio and an experienced leadership team. The changes are, however, made in light of the recent market challenges Novo Nordisk has been facing, and the development of the company’s share price since mid-2024. In light of this, the Novo Nordisk Foundation Board initiated a dialogue with the Novo Nordisk Board on the merits of an accelerated CEO succession and expressed a wish to increase its representation on the Novo Nordisk Board. Through its investment company, Novo Holdings A/S, the Novo Nordisk Foundation controls the majority of votes at the Novo Nordisk Annual General Meeting. Considering the recent market challenges, the share price decline, and the wish from the Novo Nordisk Foundation, the Novo Nordisk Board and Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen have jointly concluded that initiating a CEO succession is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen has agreed to continue as CEO for a period to support a smooth transition to new leadership. Furthermore, the Novo Nordisk Board has agreed with the Novo Nordisk Foundation Board that Lars Rebien Sørensen, chair of the Novo Nordisk Foundation, will participate as an observer in Novo Nordisk’s Board meetings as of today, with the intention of being nominated for election as a board member at the Annual General Meeting in 2026. Commenting on the changes, Helge Lund, chair of the Novo Nordisk Board, says: “Novo Nordisk’s strategy remains unchanged, and the Board is confident in the company’s current business plans and its ability to execute on the plans. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen for his outstanding contributions to Novo Nordisk’s success during his tenure as CEO. He is highly respected both inside and outside the company for his leadership, values and vision for the company and the pharmaceutical industry at large.” Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen joined Novo Nordisk in 1991 and was appointed chief executive officer in January 2017. During his time at the helm, the company has grown tremendously, fortified its leadership in diabetes care, established itself as a pioneer in the treatment of obesity and diversified into other areas of serious chronic diseases. Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen says: “Serving as Novo Nordisk’s CEO for the past eight years has been a privilege and an experience that I will always cherish. I am proud of the results I have helped create together with my leadership team, the Board, and the thousands of employees who work every day to drive change to defeat serious chronic diseases.” Commenting on Lars Rebien Sørensen’s participation in Novo Nordisk’s Board meetings, Helge Lund says: “The Board appreciates the perspectives and guidance provided by the Novo Nordisk Foundation through the Board members representing the Foundation and looks forward to working with Lars Rebien Sørensen on the Board.” Lars Rebien Sørensen brings extensive, first-hand experience of the pharmaceutical industry and its environments from his 16 years (2000-2016) as CEO of Novo Nordisk A/S. Since 2018, he has been chairing the Novo Nordisk Foundation and Novo Holdings A/S.

Title: Google’s $1 Trillion Lawsuit

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 14: Neal Mohan, CEO, YouTube attends YouTube Brandcast 2025 at David Geffen ... More Hall on May 14, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for YouTube) Alphabet has been running this ad recently: There’s Only One YouTube. Talk about bad timing. It seems Alphabet’s marketing department might not be in contact with legal, or even higher management. Consider that Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently testified in a lawsuit, attempting to prevent Alphabet’s breakup! Their argument centers on the idea that YouTube, Google Search, Google Docs, Waymo self-driving cars, and all other entities under the Alphabet umbrella have significant competition. See, Break up Google and Declare Communism. Now, Google's revenue streams can be broken down into several key areas: its core search business, advertising on YouTube, network property revenues, Google Cloud services, and a collection of other businesses. The following chart details how much each of these segments contributed to Google's overall revenue in the year 2024. Alphabet's Revenue Breakup What’s the potential impact of a breakup? Could the sum of its parts be worth significantly less than the current company, maybe even half? This explains why Google’s management is rightly worried. What would happen to all the shared intelligence and analytics expenses that boost ad sales and marketing, along with management costs? These could easily double, leaving you with half the value. The reason? Reduced size and market power. Remember when Google’s stock plummeted 10% in a day after an Apple executive hinted that Google Search was losing share? Well, a smaller, broken-up Google would definitely be in a weaker position to meet Apple’s potential price demands. Now, we take risk minimization to heart in our High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. It gets even worse. A smaller revenue base means less ability to invest in crucial new technologies and cover their fixed costs. Not a very welcome thought at a time when peers OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft are doubling down on AI development. This is an unprecedented moment, and Alphabet’s stock could plummet by 50% or even more. See Buy or Sell Google Stock. No matter what they do, that "There’s only one YouTube" ad will come back to haunt them. Timing is everything. That said, regulatory risk is just a small part of the risk assessment framework we apply while constructing Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Texas Sweetens Pitch to CEOs, Boards With New State Protections

Texas is trying to entice more companies to ditch Delaware and incorporate in the state, just like Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. did last year at the behest of Elon Musk. Governor Greg Abbott is poised to sign legislation Wednesday to clarify rules around corporate decision-making and shareholder resolutions. Backers say the measures will help bolster the state’s new business courts, which are designed to challenge the supremacy of Delaware Chancery Court as a venue for corporate disputes. The bills underscore Texas’ effort to step into the void as companies from Meta Platforms Inc. to Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management question Delaware’s status as the gold standard for incorporations and business litigation. Musk received shareholder approval last year to move Tesla’s incorporation to Texas after a Delaware judge voided his record-setting pay package. The legislation “will establish Texas as a meaningful alternative to legal incorporation in Delaware, whose law has ceased to be predictable and clear in light of growing activism by the Delaware courts and legal community,” said a consortium of companies and business groups including the Texas Stock Exchange and Texans for Lawsuit Reform. Read more: Proposed Texas Legislation Aims to Accelerate Delaware Exit One bill formalizes a common legal principle known as the business judgment rule, which assumes corporate leaders are making informed, well intentioned decisions for their companies. Under the new measure in Texas, investors seeking to challenge board decisions will now need to prove otherwise. The measures also toughen the requirements for shareholders who want to investigate corporate books or pursue derivative suits. The updated rule enables companies to require a shareholder or group of investors to own as much as 3% of voting shares to take such actions. Abbott also is expected to promote a ballot measure voters will consider in November that would ban financial transaction taxes. Illinois and New York have weighed levies on security transfers in the past, only to roll them back after outcry from exchanges. Texas is strengthening corporate protections as public equity markets converge on the state. The New York Stock Exchange announced plans earlier this year to start an equities exchange in Texas. Nasdaq Inc. said it will open a new regional headquarters in Dallas to serve as a hub for clients in Texas. The upstart Texas Stock Exchange – with backing from BlackRock Inc., Citadel Securities and Dallas pipeline billionaire Kelcy Warren – plans to start trading next year.

Title: Irish history takes off on TikTok: Meet the people teaching the world about Ireland in 60-second bites

Ireland is a nation of storytellers, with a deep tradition of passing old stories down through generations. As decades go by and society changes, so too does the way we share our scéalta. We’ve witnessed the transition from oral to written to visual and now, a new generation of historians are passing on tales of old through short-form videos on social media, namely TikTok. The platform has seen an influx of such videos, with the hashtag #IrishHistory accumulating more than 20,000 posts from comedy creators, businesses and dedicated citizen historians. Some of the more established creators sharing Irish history on the platform include Jane Casey (@janecasey.ie), Brinsley McNamara (@weirdireland), and Gemma Leahy (@theirishgem), all of whom have gone on to grow their online personas on other platforms such as Instagram, as well as creating podcasts and even writing books. Casey, who is 35 and originally from Bray but now lives in Dublin, began her working life in advertising 15 years ago. In the past year, however, she has quit her job to become a freelance social media consultant, while also creating content about interesting historical titbits. “I love history. I’m that person that drags all my mates to read a plaque on a weekend away. I’m like, ‘Lads, can we just take a detour by this graveyard?’” Combining her grá of history with her professional experience, Casey can get a message across to audiences in a way that is, as she describes it, accessible. But her transition to becoming a content creator wasn’t planned. Her very first TikTok was about prehistoric tombs in the Dublin mountains. “I didn’t expect anything [from the video]. I had [done] no editing to it – nothing – no fancy voice over. I just put it up and I got 10,000 views,” she says. Ireland is pretty amazing. 📍 Tibradden Mountain #hiketok #ireland #irishtiktok #fyp #fypireland #historytime #irishheritagemonth From there her platform grew; she now has more than 20,000 followers. She spends a lot of time researching and exploring interesting, often overlooked, sites mostly in Dublin and Wicklow. Whether it’s a video about the origins of Irish surnames or castles hidden in plain sight off the M50, her TikToks regularly clock up hundreds of thousands of views. A lover of “fun facts”, she particularly enjoys investigating quirky elements of our social history, like how Club Rock Shandy got its name (the Blackrock swimming club frequently stopped by O’Rourke’s pub in the south Dublin town for the beverage after their meets) – and is currently on a quest to find why we call the ice cream a “99”. “Where did that come from? Everyone has a different story around it,” she says. This blew my mind when I first found this out 🤯 PS. I'm ready for the Club vs Football Special arguments in the comments. NOTE: In the video I say "expat" meaning someone who lives somewhere other than their native country. I didn't know there was an effort to phase out the term until today. I now understand that "migrant" would have been more appropriate here. I'm glad my unconscious bias was pointed out - when you know better you do better, always an opportunity to learn. #ireland #dublin #history #irishhistory #irishsnacks Often an idea for a video will come to Casey while walking by an interesting building or structure, which she will later do a deep dive on using Google or the Irish Newspaper Archives. “A lot of Irish people want to learn more about their environment,” she says. “I want to deepen people’s appreciation for their surroundings and for this country.” Around 20 per cent of her video views come from outside Ireland, mainly the US. “There’s also a massive cohort of people who might have left Ireland years ago, or maybe their parents left Ireland, and they have found my content while seeking a connection to the homeland, which is really lovely too.” Like Casey, Leahy (35) has found a fan base in the US and Canada; about 70 per cent of her views come from across the pond, with the remaining 30 per cent spread across Ireland and Europe. She has a following on TikTok of 1.1 million. “A lot of Americans have extreme pride about being Irish and they like to learn a bit more about where they’ve come from, their culture. They just like to see someone chatting about the place they’re proud of. Some of them are nearly more proud than we are,” says Leahy, who is a learning and development manager for PepsiCo by day. Now living in Leicester in England but originally from Westmeath, Leahy was on furlough from work during the Covid-19 lockdowns and was alone during the day as her partner, a postwoman, was busy delivering letters and packages. Friends began to tag her in videos that reminded them of her and, eventually, this lead to her creating her own content and TikTok page. Irish History Storys-Part 1 Dracula #irishhistory #irishhistory #irishstory #Dracula #irishinventions #irish #irishgem #irishtales #irishdaily #CapCut Her videos typically feature her chatting directly to the camera about Irishisms, presumably directed at international audiences. One of her videos like this, about the origins of Dracula, has more than 1.1 million views; another, about how to pronounce Irish girls’ names such as Caoimhe and Róisín, has been watched more than nine million times. She has also made some on-location videos from the likes of Seán’s Bar in Athlone, which dates from AD 900 and claims to be the oldest pub in Ireland. Leahy says she particularly loved making that video because she got to see the old-school interior and learn how to pull a proper pint of Guinness. “I’ve put [the video] up multiple times now and it always does well, because people just find it fascinating.” History hasn’t always been Leahy’s thing – in fact, she didn’t like it much as a subject at school. But her interest has grown since emigrating to the UK. “As you move away from home, you become more proud to be Irish and, then, you’re more proud of showing off the stuff that maybe you didn’t learn in school. Living in England especially, you become extra proud to be Irish. I love to have discussions with people over here,” she says. Leahy says she particularly loves sharing stories about what the Irish have achieved on the world stage, such as how Kilkenny-born James Hoban designed the White House, how Irish soldier Michael Keogh came close to assassinating Adolf Hitler, and the story of inspirational women such as Lady Gregory and Grace O’Malley. Irish Women Part 5- Lady Gregory #internationalwomansday #irishwomen #famouswomen #irishhistory #irishstorys #irishfacts #irishgem #theirishgem #graceomalley #irish #CapCut #Inspiring #CapCut #CapCut McNamara’s TikToks start off with a distinctive introduction – “Well, I’m Brinsley McNamara and welcome to Weird Ireland” – before launching into whatever interesting snapshot he has put together for the day’s video. The 32-year-old started with a page documenting “Weird Westmeath”, where he is from, widening the focus last year to all of Ireland. He has since gone on to publish a book and start a podcast. “All the stuff that’s in [Weird Ireland] is stuff I was looking at anyway, I just wasn’t taking videos and pictures,” he says. “It was just a matter of taking the leap and starting imperfect and getting better. I like going around looking at things. I like making videos of them. And having a page to do that, it’s great.” He works off recommendations from viewers these days, but also looks at Google Maps to find interesting sites. Within weeks of starting his page, he noticed a “tremendous” reaction to the videos, with views reaching in the hundreds of thousands. Like Casey, he believes it stems back to people’s connection with their locality. His videos may not be as detailed as other creators on TikTok; McNamara deliberately offers just enough information to engage a viewer but allow them to do further digging on the topic elsewhere, if they want to. He encourages people to visit the sites themselves, take some photos and “make a day out” of it. While these creators have built a platform based on sharing history with others, none have studied history at university. Does this matter? For professional historian Kerron Ó Luain, who has a BA, MA and PhD, it does not, though he can see how some historians may have an issue with the short-form format of these videos. “If I’m sitting there, picturing older historians or professors, they’d be saying: ‘How can you really deliver, in such a short format, the whole picture or whole context.’ But, personally, I wouldn’t have a problem with it, as long as [the videos] are direct.” Diarmaid Ferriter, professor of modern Irish history at University College Dublin and a contributor to The Irish Times, sees social media as a tool for democratising history, which is often kept behind closed doors in academic databases and in universities. Social media can also distort history in a very serious and damaging way because people can decide to be very selective “There’s no point in us being snobbish about it,” he says. “We’re not high-priest historians who have some kind of monopoly on the communication of history, or the right interpretation of history, so it’s not for us to be dismissive.” For the most part, these “citizen historians” are acting out of a genuine love and interest for times gone by, but a concern for Ó Luain would be the odd “bad-faith actor” who could use a platform under the guise of Irish history to spread hateful messages, such as anti-immigration ones. As Ferriter says: “Social media can also distort history in a very serious and damaging way because people can decide to be very selective about what they choose to highlight, if they’re trying to make a particular case or if they’re trying to argue around some contentious issue that they are right by pointing to history.” Ó Luain says the way history is told has changed over time, long before social media. “Something similar happened in the 1960s – prior to that, everything was based on only written history texts. Then, this new thing – oral history – emerged and there was the same critique: ‘You can’t trust what people are saying.’ But oral history developed in its own way over the last 50 or 60 years and it’s now an established format,” he says. If historians don’t move with the times, they’ll be left with a very small audience. “Public history was a thing going back like 10 or 15 years before the emergence of social media, where some historians say, ‘We have to get out and do talks in local communities’ and things like that – bring history to the average citizen,” he says. “Now, if you’re talking to a room of 20 people, you can talk to a room of 20,000 at any given time. It’s just that on a grander scale. “Some historians only speak to an increasingly narrow demographic. And that’s the way these things are shifting towards the youth – it’s all about these platforms. So why not use both if you can?” Capitalising on the trend, TikTok Ireland is launching a hub to bring content together in one place under the hashtag #IrishHistory, which will make the content easier for users to discover, and boost the profiles of the creators making such content. For the creators such as Casey, it’s a welcome move. As she explains, there are plenty of historical programmes broadcast on the likes of RTÉ or Virgin Media, but viewership of traditional media has decreased, particularly among young people. “TikTok is where people are at. The likes of the Irish History Hub is an amazing way to present history in a really accessible way and to encourage creators to get involved too. It’s a way to bring our heritage to a new audience because the reality is, they’re not watching TV. They’re on their phones. TikTok is far more than just dances, as it was a couple of years ago.” Rebecca Daly is an Irish Times journalist © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

The sale occurred against the backdrop of growing market uncertainty triggered by a wave of U.S. tariffs that rattled global trade and risk assets. Notably, the filing’s cutoff date—March 31—came just two days before the so-called ‘Liberation Day’ on April 2, 2025—a reference to the day the U.S. imposed comprehensive tariffs affecting nearly all its major trading partners. The SEC filing, dated May 15, confirms SWIB sold its Bitcoin ETF holdings ahead of the March 31 reporting date for the end of the first quarter of the year. According to the board's previous filing, dated February 14, the fund held 6,060,351 IBIT shares, worth approximately $321,501,621. Shifting market optics The broader economic landscape also shifted dramatically following President Donald Trump’s inauguration, which began an aggressive new trade policy that seeks to reshore manufacturing on U.S. soil and spur domestic growth. The administration announced 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on Chinese imports on February 1. Two days later, the Canada and Mexico tariffs were paused for 30 days, though the 10% tariff on China took effect on February 4. By February 11, President Trump reinstated a 25% tariff on steel imports and raised the tariff on aluminum to 25%. Trade pressure ramped up on March 4, when the U.S. increased tariffs on China to 20%. The tit-for-tat policy spiral of tariffs led to significant market instability, with Goldman Sachs analysts warning the new tariffs could push core inflation to 3.8% this year. The crypto markets were not left unscathed, where Bitcoin fell 2.3% to around $83,200, while Ethereum dropped 4.5%. Amid a retaliatory spiral, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods surged to 145%, while China raised tariffs on U.S. products to 125%, sending Bitcoin below $75,000. Tensions began to ease in May when the U.S. and China temporarily reduced tariffs. The U.S. lowered its rate on Chinese goods to 30%, while China reduced its tariff on U.S. imports to 10%. As of mid-May, President Trump has also paused most reciprocal tariffs on other countries.

Title: High-rise condo project in Las Vegas being considered by Summerlin developer
URL: https://www.reviewjournal.com/post/3373079
Time Published: 2025-05-15T22:51:45Z

Howard Hughes Holdings CEO David O’Reilly said he’s contemplating a high-rise project near the Downtown Summerlin open-air mall. Summerlin’s developer has filled out tracts of land across from its big outdoor mall in Las Vegas, building apartments, a ballpark and a new retail center with a Whole Foods Market that opened Thursday. It could also put up high-rise housing. Howard Hughes Holdings CEO David O’Reilly said in a recent interview that he’s contemplating a high-rise condo project on land just east of the Downtown Summerlin open-air mall off Sahara Avenue and the 215 Beltway. “I think that’s a great use right now,” he told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. O’Reilly pointed to condo sales in The Summit Club, a wealthy enclave in Summerlin with homeowners such as movie star Mark Wahlberg. He said land near the mall could have a mix of offices, retail, and for-sale and rental housing, but he also noted that plans for that area have evolved over the years. He said the company would have penciled a lot more office space for the site a decade ago than it would today, after the pandemic slashed demand for offices around the country amid widespread work-from-home arrangements. Hedge-fund stock deal O’Reilly spoke with the Review-Journal after New York hedge-fund boss Bill Ackman reached a deal to boost his ownership stake in the developer and widen its scope of operations. As announced May 5, Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management acquired 9 million newly issued shares in Texas-based Hughes Holdings for $100 apiece, or $900 million total. Ackman, the company’s former chairman, was also named executive chairman, and his investment firm’s ownership stake in the developer climbed to 46.9 percent from 37.6 percent as of early this year. Ackman had sought to acquire 10 million new shares in Hughes Holdings for $90 apiece — also $900 million total — and take the helm as chairman and chief executive. Instead, his firm bought less stock at a higher price-per-share, and O’Reilly kept the CEO’s seat. The deal will enable the developer to become a diversified holding company by acquiring controlling stakes in operating companies — a shift proposed by Ackman — while still growing its core real estate business, according to a news release. Hughes Holdings has projects and properties, including master-planned communities such as Summerlin, in Texas, Arizona, Hawaii, Maryland and Nevada. Spanning 22,500 acres along the Las Vegas Valley’s western rim, Summerlin boasts 130,000 residents and some of the highest home prices in Southern Nevada, as well as parks, trails and community centers. The developer’s namesake Howard Hughes, the famed aviator, business tycoon and recluse, acquired the land mass in the 1950s. Hughes Holdings sells land in Summerlin to homebuilders and has developed hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of projects in the heart of Las Vegas’ biggest master-planned community. $900M ‘put to work’ O’Reilly said the transaction with Pershing Square will not impact Summerlin’s development or the company’s broader real estate business, other than improving its credit and cost of capital. He also indicated that it would use the investment from Ackman’s firm to buy stakes in outside companies. “It’s that $900 million that’s going to be put to work to do that,” O’Reilly said. He said the task of finding, valuing and buying stakes in other companies will be largely handled by Pershing Square and Hughes Holdings’ new chief investment officer, Ryan Israel, who holds the same role at Ackman’s firm. Plus, O’Reilly doesn’t expect to invest in real estate-related businesses, noting such companies typically spend a lot of money upfront and wait a while for returns to roll in. Pershing Square’s investment portfolio has included such companies as payroll processor ADP, streaming giant Netflix and ride-hailing firm Uber. “I think it would be unlikely to actually see us invest in a real estate business,” O’Reilly said. Contact Eli Segall at esegall@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0342. Realtors with Las Vegas Realtors volunteered to help put finishing touches on a home repair by Rebuilding Together Southern Nevada. Fewer than 20 percent of Nevada residents now believe the state is an affordable place to live, and many Nevadans have considered leaving as a result of the housing crisis, a survey finds. The Las Vegas Planning Commission approved plans for the new complex that would be built in the central Las Vegas Valley near downtown and the Strip. New data shows a glut of new multifamily units has hit the market and vacancy rates have held steady. The Las Vegas Planning Commission voted against recommending a resort and housing project proposed for the Historic Westside during a lengthy meeting. Rental rates are varying across the entire Las Vegas Valley, according to a new report from Zumper. Here’s why. Gov. Joe Lombardo and U.S. Rep. Mark Amodei have taken direct aim at the Bureau of Land Management’s vast control of the Las Vegas Valley regarding the housing crisis. A luxury real estate agent says many of his clients are moving to the Las Vegas Valley from California because they are looking for a different lifestyle. A portion of the project site was previously owned by two entertainers synonymous with America’s casino capital. Last month the median price of a home dropped $5,000 from a record high, according to Las Vegas Realtors.

Title: It looks like Meta just hit a big AI roadblock

Meta (META-2.36%) reportedly has delayed the release of its latest artificial intelligence model, known internally as “Behemoth,” raising concerns among employees about the effectiveness and direction of the company’s massive AI investments. Engineers have struggled to improve the large-language model’s performance compared to earlier versions in the Llama model family, The Wall Street Journal (NWSA-0.90%) reports. This has prompted internal debate about whether the upgrade is substantial enough to merit public release, sources told the Journal. Shares in Meta were down more than 2% by Thursday’s close. Initially set for an April debut during Meta’s first AI developer conference, Behemoth’s launch was pushed to June and potentially has been postponed until at least the fall. When Meta released two smaller Llama models in April, the company was praised for the speed with which it has caught up with rivals when it comes to developing its own generative AI tools. The company now faces increasing pressure to demonstrate meaningful progress with Behemoth and signal to Wall Street it can follow through with a return-on-investment. Meta has spent billions on AI development, with plans for up to $65 billion in capital expenditures this year. Its stock price to earnings ratio is 25.05, as of May 15, meaning investors are paying $25.05 for every $1 of earnings. Though Meta has publicly claimed Behemoth outperforms competing models such as OpenAI, Google (GOOGL-1.57%), and Anthropic in some benchmarks, internal sources told the Journal that the model is facing significant training challenges, and its real-world performance may not live up to the company’s public claims. Meta’s AI journey began with its Fundamental AI Research Team, which developed the original Llama models in early 2023. However, 11 of the 14 authors of the initial Llama paper have since left the company, and newer versions are being built by a different team. Controversy also arose in April when it was revealed that the model Meta submitted to a widely used AI chatbot leaderboard was not the same version released to the public. Meta later admitted it had optimized the submitted model specifically for the benchmark. Meta is not alone in facing delays, however. OpenAI’s next major model, GPT-5, has also been postponed, with the company instead rolling out an intermediate version called GPT-4.5. Anthropic has likewise delayed the release of Claude 3.5 Opus, a larger and more powerful AI model, though it said the release is imminent.

Title: AI, Quantum Stocks Are Some of the Most Shorted on Wall Street

AI stocks are the hottest trades on Wall Street again. They're also among traders' favorite stocks to bet against. Wall Street regained its risk appetite this week thanks to easing U.S.-China tensions, soft inflation data, and a slew of deal announcements out of President Trump's Middle East tour. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), sometimes called “the fear index,” dropped below 20 for the first time since March on Monday and has held steady since then. AI stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), Palantir (PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have been among the biggest beneficiaries of investors' subsiding fear. But with stock gains comes speculation that the rally won't last, and thus more interest from active traders, like hedge funds, looking for opportunities to profit from pullbacks. Among the stocks least loved by active traders is SoundHound AI (SOUN). Traders have sold short about $1.2 billion of the Nvidia-backed company’s stock, compared with just $340 million of long positions, according to data from market research firm S3 Partners. Another notable name: Super Micro Computer (SMCI), shares of which have soared about 40% this week amid a blistering AI rally. The total value of Supermicro short positions exceeds long positions by more than half a billion dollars. In dollar terms, SoundHound and Supermicro skew short more than most stocks. But relative to their size, these two stocks have more bullish support than some other hot stocks. Traders have sold short five times as much Rigetti Computing (RGTI) stock as they’ve bought long. Two more quantum computing stocks—IonQ (IONQ) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS)—have short-to-long ratios exceeding 2:1. Other stocks in which short positions are about double long positions include Plug Power (PLUG), Trump Media & Technology (DJT), and GameStop (GME).

Avenir held 14.7 million IBIT shares worth $688 million as of March 31, according to its filing,. That marks a 30% increase from the firm's IBIT holdings for the fourth quarter of 2024. IBIT represents about 86% of Avenir’s portfolio, according to investment research platform Fintel. The firm made clear its commitment to investing in crypto-focused products in February, revealing that it had acquired about 11,300, then worth $599 million in a press release. The company, which said it had “emerged as a major institutional player in the digital asset market,” held about 52,500 shares of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC), worth more than $4.2 million, according to Fintel. "This strategic move not only underscores Avenir's confidence in the future of digital assets but also marks a pivotal moment in its brand evolution and business strategy,” Avenir said in a previous statement on its digital assets-focused initiatives. Decrypt reached out to Avenir for additional comment. Avenir's 14.7 million IBIT shares are worth $863,478,000 based on recent pricing. IBIT was recently trading at $58.74, Yahoo Finance data shows. Bitcoin ETFs offer investors access to the asset without holding it directly. The firm's additional investment into IBIT reflects Hong Kong and other Asian hubs’ strong interest in digital assets. It also comes as institutions increasingly embrace cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, amid the U.S.’s ongoing pro-crypto pivot. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have generated more than $41 billion in net inflows since the first 10 of these products received SEC approvals in January 2024, despite a recent dip in trading, according to data provider Farside. Their recent resurgence follows U.S. President Donald Trump's issuance of executive orders to protect Bitcoin miners’ rights and authorize the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the U.S. Treasury. The directives underscore President Trump's continued commitment to transform the U.S. into the “undisputed Bitcoin superpower and crypto capital of the world”—a pillar of his campaign promises to the crypto community. Meanwhile, pro-Bitcoin initiatives have also gained traction at the local level over the past few months, with more than a dozen states evaluating legislative proposals to add the token to their Treasury reserves. Avenir's increased Bitcoin ETF investment forms part of its recent push to deepen its engagement with the digital asset market. The firm launched its Crypto Partnership Program last fall, allocating $500 million for its collaborations with digital asset-focused quantitative trading teams across the world.

Title: Speed And Safety: What Circle’s IPO Means For Stablecoins
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/earlcarr/2025/05/15/speed-and-safety-what-circles-ipo-means-for-stablecoins/

ByEarl Carr ByEarl Carr, Contributor. PARIS, FRANCE - FEBRUARY 16: In this photo illustration, a visual representation of digital ... More cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethernum, Dash, Monero and Litecoin is displayed on February 16, 2018 in Paris, France. Digital cryptocurrencies have seen unprecedented growth in 2017, despite remaining extremely volatile. (Photo Illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images) From minted coins and paper notes to credit cards and electronic transfers, money’s development has been a march toward greater convenience, efficiency and safety. Stablecoin issuers now view themselves as the latest stage in this journey. With stringent Know Your Customer, Anti-Money Laundering, credit history, and solvency requirements, the modern financial system excludes many individuals and small-and-medium enterprises in the developing world from participating in the global, dollar-based economy. According to Mento Labs, a decentralized stablecoin platform, “nearly 2.5 billion people (a credit gap of $4.9tn)...are excluded from formal financial services.” From Mexican farmers lacking credit histories to cash-strapped Indonesian SMEs, developing consumers’ demand for capital has been walled in by regulatory and technical barriers. Despite stablecoin’s origin as a liquidity tool for specialized crypto traders, the technology is now billed as an inclusive upgrade to a traditionally Western-dominated financial system. This focus on efficiency and ease-of-access is reflected in many current issuers’ value propositions. Early stablecoins, like BitUSD, NuBits, and TerraUSD, used algorithms and crypto collateral to prop their peg to the dollar. According to Deltec Bank, these pillars collapsed in market downturns, prompting most issuers to shut down, their tokens worth only a small fraction of real dollars. Tether distinguished itself by backing its USDT stablecoin with fiat securities, such as cash and Treasuries, opening the door for the tokens to act like digital dollars instead of a risk asset. Particularly in international transfers, this newfound predictability has fueled significant cost reductions; wire transfers costs of sending USD have long hovered around $44 per transaction. With the advent of USDC (Circle Internet Financial’s stablecoin), on Ethereum, that cost dropped to $12. Roland Berger reports that on faster and cheaper Layer 2 blockchains like Base, this cost has fallen to below one cent. International transfer costs using stablecoins have dropped by over 97% since 2015. Seizing on this opportunity, investors poured capital into the industry: In 2021, the market cap of the top three stablecoins was $54.66 billion. As of 2025, those top three became ten, and total market cap had quadrupled to $221 billion , according to a Statista report. Notably, traditional finance heavyweights like PayPal and BlackRock entered the industry, signaling broader institutional adoption. Comparison of top 10 stablecoins In this still-growing stage of the industry, issuers are adopting a variety of strategies to attract users and uphold the peg. The aforementioned traditionalists adopt Tether’s strategy, using U.S. dollar deposits and Treasuries to maintain the 1:1 equivalency. On the other hand, decentralized finance companies like Ethena or Dai favor complex crypto derivative and smart contracts to complement leaner fiat reserves. Across the board, companies grapple with the need to balance efficiency with regulatory compliance and predictability. Despite this difficulty, future market leaders will need to walk this tightrope. The ideal issuer must balance three pillars: a reliably fixed value coin, network connections that maximize potential user base, and an embrace of auditing/regulation. One company that has adopted these three pillars is Circle, whose USDC stablecoin is the second largest by market cap as measured by CoinMarketCap. Their reserves are audited by Deloitte and stored as repos, short-dated Treasuries, and cash. Similarly, Circle's euro-backed stablecoin, EURC, is supported by euro-denominated reserves held as cash in segregated, global bank accounts. Circle's Reserve Fund is an even split between Repos and short-term Treasuries Even after breaking their USD peg amid Silicon Valley Bank’s infamous 2023 collapse, Circle has regained the market’s confidence by diversifying away from regional banks like SVB assuring investors that reserve deposits would be fully available to them after the collapse, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. The company has won further trust by embracing increased stablecoin regulation. Since launching USDC in 2018, Circle voluntarily published monthly reserve reports. Their rival Tether, the largest stablecoin by market cap, has never been fully audited. CEO Jeremy Allaire has led the charge, praising recent legislation like the GENIUS act and calling for all USD-pegged stablecoin issuers to be registered in the US. Circle compounds on their transparency and stability mantra by combining USDC and EURC with a collection of Web3 services designed to increase user flexibility. While minting/redeeming services, smart contract, and developer tools are not unheard of in the industry, the company’s combination augments the company’s already robust stablecoins with a convenient, all-in-one package. With its focus on accessibility and transparency, Circle’s leadership is confident the upcoming IPO is more than a chance to raise capital. Opening Circle to public investment brings the company one step closer to an ecosystem where the "speed, cost, and access" of blockchain commerce unlocks global prosperity.

Title: AurealOne Leads the Pack Top Crypto Presales Transforming Gaming & Web3!

Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. The crypto world is constantly expanding, and navigating it can be difficult. Choosing the right asset from a deluge of emerging new tokens as blockchain-based digital assets develop can feel like a gamble. This carefully selected list brings down the best cryptocurrencies worth your attention now, especially for those who want to get in on the trends for Web3 gaming, DeFi evolution, and cross-chain architecture. Top 5 Cryptos: 1. AurealOne (DLUME): Powering the Next Era of Web3 Gaming & the Metaverse AurealOne is changing the decentralized gaming world with a frictionless, high-performance blockchain for the cutting-edge Web3 and metaverse experience. Its native token, DLUME, underpins transactions, governance, and game economies as more and more games and virtual worlds join the ecosystem. Click here to visit AurealOne DLUME Presale and Token Trajectory DLUME is in stage 9 of a 21-phase presale. It is currently selling for $0.0013 and is anticipated to reach $0.0055 at launch. The planned laddered presale, which will go from $0.0005 to $0.0045, provides an opportunity to enjoy the promising upswing before the main net comes alive. Cutting-Edge Tech & Immersive Gameplay AurealOne’s game-first approach is backed by Zero Knowledge rollups for scalable throughput, with DarkLume (a rich, dark fantasy metaverse) and Clash of Tiles (a tactical PvP battler) added to the mix. With community governance and an evident roadmap, AurealOne is a viable player in blockchain gaming. 2. DexBoss (DEBO): Making DeFi Powerful Yet Simple DexBoss aims to democratize DeFi with intuitive interfaces, cutting-edge trading tools, and scalable cross-chain compatibility. It does not matter whether you are new to crypto or an old hand of DeFi, DexBoss gives strong staking, yield farming, and leveraged trading. DEBO Tokenomics & Presale Status DEBO is now in phase 7 of 17, selling at $0.011 when it opened at $0.01. The token’s initial value at launch will be $0.0505, with the presale reserving 500 million DEBO of the total supply of 1 billion. It has a deflationary model comprising regular buybacks and burns. Advanced Features DexBoss intends to launch full DEX listings, fiat onboarding, staking dashboards, and multichain support in mid-2025. Its audited smart contracts and deep liquidity pools guarantee security and speed. DEBO is one of the most useful DeFi assets with prospects in the long term. 3. Bitcoin (BTC): The Foundation of DigiFi & Institutional Trust The first decentralized cryptocurrency with a limited supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin, ruled over the digital asset space in 2025. Institutional interest is exploding. BlackRock infused $232.9 million into the BTC ETFs, and Coinbase proclaimed a current all-time-$1 billion BTC outflow in a day, a testament to accumulation. Surrounded by rumours that Coinbase is going to be added to the S&P 500 and technical analysts keeping an eye out for a double-top formation, BTC is still the most liquid, trustworthy, and globally compatible crypto-asset, now adopted by central banks and hedge funds as a strategic reserve. 4. Pi Network (PI): Unlocking Mobile Crypto Adoption Pi Network focuses on crypto for the masses with a mobile-first, energy-efficient strategy. Unlike traditional mining, Pi can be mined via a simple mobile app with mass participation in a low-barrier ecosystem. Pi is unlisted on major exchanges, but with a huge clientele and ecosystem already in place, it is set to roll out peer-to-peer transactions, staking, as well as marketplace integrations in the future. The token is oriented toward everyday use in a decentralized mobile economy. Having over 50 million users globally, Pi’s community-driven growth strategy and focus on accessibility make it a possible breakthrough in worldwide crypto adoption, particularly in areas with scarce resources for classic money management. 5. Penguiana (PENGU): The Play-to-Earn Penguin Sensation Penguiana is a play-to-earn, meme-driven platform focused on penguins in the Solana blockchain. Its $PENGU token allows players to mint GUIANA NFTs – 3D penguin avatars required for playing the game and getting rewards. The game was created using Unity and allows players immersive obstacle courses where they gather points and tokens. Significantly, 80% of the $PENGU used in minting NFTs is destroyed, thus making the token less common. A successful presale and an upcoming game demo prove that Penguiana is committed to merging entertainment with actual utility. In summary! DLUME and DEBO take the frontline in presale ingenuity for Web3 gaming and DeFi, respectively. AurealOne is a next-generation blockchain gaming platform offering lightning-fast transactions, near-zero gas fees, and immersive metaverse experiences powered by its native DLUME token. Bitcoin does not lose its place as the world’s digital backbone of fintch. Pi Network brings new life to crypto for the average user, and Penguiana combines fun with tokenized rewards in a rapidly developing play-to-earn ecosystem. Each project brings distinct value to the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

Title: Nvidia-backed CoreWeave revealed big AI bills — and the stock dipped 13%

CoreWeave stock tumbled Wednesday following its first earnings report since going public, as the data center company’s growing capital expenditure raised concerns among investors. Shares in the Nvidia-backed (NVDA-1.54%) company initially dropped more than 13% during after-hours trading, following the results before shares rebounded on Thursday morning. CoreWeave is a so-called ‘picks and shovels’ company of the AI revolution. It’s one of the largest holders of Nvidia’s graphics processing units and leases data center capacity to Big Tech companies. The firm’s executives said in a call following the report’s publication that it expects to spend between $20 billion and $23 billion in 2025. That tops the $18.3 billion projected by Wall Street analysts, according to Yahoo Finance, citing Bloomberg consensus estimates. Analysts downgraded their outlook for CoreWeave stock following the news. Gil Luria of DA Davidson downgraded the stock to an Underperform rating from Neutral on Thursday morning, citing the “level of capital intensity equity investors are unlikely to stomach.” Luria also pointed to CoreWeave’s soaring interest expenses for the decision. The company’s interest expenses rose 549% in the first quarter, totaling $264 million. That’s more than the $182 million projected by Wall Street, according to Yahoo Finance (APO-2.36%), citing Bloomberg data. Operating expenses have been soaring too. While CoreWeave announced a 420% revenue increase from the same period last year, it also unveiled a 487% jump in operating costs, totaling more than $1 billion for the first quarter of the year. CoreWeave is not the first tech company to take an expensive gamble on AI-related infrastructure — and then be punished on Wall Street for it. Leading the pack is Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%), which plans to allocate $80 billion in capital expenditures for data center development in the 2025 fiscal year, it announced in a January blog post. Analysts forecast that such spending could create a drag on margins for several years. Meanwhile, Amazon’s (AMZN-2.87%) capital expenditures are expected to reach approximately $75 billion in 2025, up more than 50% from the previous year. Following that company call in February, its stock slipped more than 5% in after-hours trading. Alphabet (GOOGL-1.57%) also plans to spend $75 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, the majority of which to be directed to enhancing technical infrastructure for AI, it announced during a call with investors in February. Google’s stock fell more than 8% immediately after. Likewise, Meta (META-2.36%) has set its AI capital expenditure budget at $60 billion to $65 billion for 2025—a significant jump from previous years.

ByTy Roush ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. Major U.S. stocks like Nvidia, Alphabet and Amazon rose amid President Donald Trump’s four-day trip to the Middle East, which ends Thursday after he announced deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars that lifted the defense, aviation and AI industries—though a broader market selloff earlier on Thursday appeared to slow growth. Trump has announced deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars during a four-day trip to the Middle ... More East. Super Micro Computers: The information tech firm saw its shares rise by nearly 30.6% through the last two trading sessions after reaching a $20 billion partnership with Saudi Arabian data center DataVolt on Tuesday, and Super Micro’s stock increased slightly (0.2%) by Thursday afternoon. Nvidia: Shares of Nvidia, which increased by 0.5% Thursday, increased by roughly 11% through Tuesday and Wednesday after announcing a deal to supply 18,000 AI chips to Saudi-backed Humain. AMD: The semiconductor firm’s stock dipped by more than 1% on Thursday after jumping by 7.4% over the last two days after revealing on Tuesday a $10 billion project with Saudi Arabia to supply chips and software for AI data centers. Palantir: As one of the U.S.-based companies to attend the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum this week, Palantir’s shares rose by roughly 10% over the last two trading sessions before falling nearly 1% on Thursday. Boeing: The aircraft maker achieved a 52-week high on Wednesday after announcing a $96 billion deal to supply 210 jets for Qatar Airways, and Boeing’s shares rose again on Thursday by nearly 1.2%. Alphabet: Google’s parent company joined Oracle, Salesforce and AMD, among others, in a $80 billion investment to develop “cutting-edge transformative technologies” in Saudi Arabia and the U.S., the White House said Tuesday, as its shares rose by 3.5% on Wednesday before dipping slightly Thursday. Amazon: Shares of Amazon rose by 1.3% on Tuesday after the company announced a $5 billion partnership to develop an “AI Zone” in Saudi Arabia, though the stock’s positive movement was reversed after it dropped by 0.5% on Wednesday and 2.3% on Thursday. Tesla: CEO Elon Musk was among the billionaires to join Trump in the Middle East, a move that appeared to shift Tesla’s stock up by 8.6% over the last two trading sessions, before the automaker’s shares fell by just under 1% on Thursday. Each of the three market indexes increased by Thursday afternoon after an earlier selloff, largely driven by Walmart’s shares dropping by more than 3% and UnitedHealth’s stock plummeting 14%. The S&P 500, on pace to continue a winning streak for a fourth-straight day, rose by 0.4% as the Nasdaq added 0.2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 176 points, or 0.4%. Thursday’s earlier broad stock decline was likely the result of “cautious optimism as recession fears recede, investors told CNBC, with some confidence added after the U.S. and China reached a trade deal earlier this week, . Trump and many major U.S.-based companies announced several deals for projects in defense, aviation, AI and other industries since he arrived in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. The White House said Saudi Arabia had agreed to invest $600 billion in the U.S., though some investments were already in the works, with additional deals worth more than $300 billion signed at an investor conference attended by several U.S. billionaires, including Elon Musk, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Palantir’s Alex Karp, among others. Trump’s visit has largely focused on economic investments in the U.S. rather than geopolitical strategy, though Trump said Thursday Iran had “sort of agreed to the terms” of a deal with the U.S. to scale back nuclear weapons production.

This story was produced by The Margin in collaboration with The Nation.Please note this article contains mention of suicide, self-harm, and sexual violence. Near gale force winds stretched nimbostratus clouds that resembled alpine peaks turned sideways above the heavily industrialized zone known as the Tacoma Tideflats on a Saturday afternoon in mid-March. Concertina wire spiraled down the top of the chain-link fence marking the western edge of E. J Street. A nearby train engine billowed diesel exhaust, contaminating the wind. Its unmistakable stench stung the nostrils. Reflections of the compound buildings appeared in pools of rainwater and pulsed and blurred with each passing breeze. From the south, a big wind rose, slanting heavy raindrops against a group of some 40 protesters led by La Resistencia. They stood together with protest signs that folded and unfolded in the wind and rain. Inside soaked jackets, members and allies of the activist organization stood in solidarity against the Northwest ICE Processing Center, also known as the Northwest Detention Center, which is owned by The GEO Group and is contracted by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), which is within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The facility houses all genders. The detention center imprisons people who are suspected of violating civil immigration laws. While immigrants detained in the facility are from countries across the globe, many are from Latin America, one of several regions that has felt the brunt of European colonization and American imperialism. The impacts of these forces have made life in the countries unlivable for many, forcing people to migrate. However, when they reach the borders of the countries, including the United States, which have contributed to or caused their displacement, they are met with hostility and immigration policies that turn their plight into profit. The GEO Group acquired Corrections Services Corporation and its detention facility in a heavily industrialized area, allegedly exposing immigrants to numerous sources of pollution. Over nearly 30 years, numerous test pits and groundwater monitoring wells, both immediately adjacent to and beneath the detention facility site, have revealed the presence of petroleum products, including diesel, gasoline, and heavy oil. Furthermore, the detention facility has a notorious reputation due to years of documented human rights abuses. Despite these man-made forces, La Resistencia movement leaders and their allies are standing up to fight the facility and what it represents, mindful of those who’ve been targeted and whose rights have been taken, just as so many of their ancestors’ labor, land, and natural resources were—and continue to be—taken. The GEO Group is paid by the federal government to house people there, and is guaranteed a minimum number of detainees, causing the people detained in the facility to be valued as commodities. As the rain continued to pour, the protesters were quickly drenched, yet they remained, resolute and unified in their demands. Rufina Reyes, director of the La Resistencia, led the group by declaring: “¡No están solo!” Her voice was amplified loud enough for the sound waves to echo off the detention facility’s walls. The crowd echoed in unison, “You are not alone!” The sound waves of the calls interweaved like a multilingual prayer sanctified by the heavy rain and wind.“We’re opposed to detentions and deportations, and we don’t want any more family separation!” Reyes shouted through an interpreter. The volcanic mountain known as Tahoma towered above the valley and flatlands. Prior to the construction of the GEO Group’s detention facility, the site was a rich tidal estuary, known by many names, and was the ancestral homeland of the Puyallup people since time immemorial. Following colonization, conflict, and the eventual signing of the Treaty of Medicine Creek in 1854, the land was settled by American immigrants. Still, the Puyallup Tribe retains certain rights over the area as a result of the 1854 treaty and the subsequent Land Claims Settlement Act of 1990. In the immediate area where the detention facility would be built, fill was brought in or dredged from the river estuary to serve as a foundation for a meat processing and packing plant that opened in 1904, a Standard Oil fuel storage and distribution facility that opened in 1905, and a coal gasification plant that opened in 1924. The coal gasification plant operated until 1956 and was demolished in 1966. The fuel storage and distribution facility, later owned by Chevron, operated through 1988 and included 13 above-ground and four underground fuel storage tanks, three petroleum pipelines, and numerous garages. The GEO Group now owns the site and parks its vehicles on it. A metals recycling facility was constructed immediately southeast of the future detention site by 1967. This facility recycled cars and electrical transformers, polluting the area with PCBs and heavy metals. The coal gasification site, the meatpacking site, and the metals recycling site would later be designated as a Superfund site by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The Washington State Department of Ecology has stated that the EPA Superfund site around the detention facility is remediated, “capped” by layers of supposedly impermeable barriers, asphalt, and crumbled cement from the meatpacking facility. It now resembles an innocuous mound covered, bizarrely, in green grass. But an underground benzene plume exists just below the surface, not far from the southern edge of the property line where the detention facility now stands. In 1988, a 3,500-gallon underground oil storage tank had to be removed, and along with it, 376 tons (752,000 pounds) of petroleum-affected soil and over 8,000 gallons of petroleum-affected groundwater. Yet more remained. Adding to the petroleum contamination, the nearby Standard Oil facility, which Chevron now owns, leaked petroleum products into the soil, contaminating the surrounding groundwater. Washington state Department of Ecology’s groundwater monitoring wells have detected diesel and heavy oil in wells just outside the walls of the detention facility as recently as November 2024. MTCA Method A Cleanup Levels is a regulatory approach used under Washington State’s Model Toxics Control Act (MTCA) to establish acceptable levels of contaminants in soil, groundwater, and other environmental media during site cleanups. In 1996, Correction Services Corporation, now owned by GEO Group, began searching for a site to build a migrant detention facility near Seattle. After considering several locations in neighboring towns, they ultimately landed on 1623 E. J Street in Tacoma. Then Tacoma City Council member Kevin Phelps was a vocal supporter of this location, citing economic benefits, specifically business and occupation taxes the city would garner. GEO Group was issued contract revenue bonds by The Washington Economic Development Finance Authority in 2003 for $57,415,000 and in 2011 for $54,375,000 to construct and expand the facility. Washington Representatives at the time, Adam Smith and Norm Dicks worked alongside Tacoma city leaders to persuade GEO Group to seek to build the facility atop the Superfund site. Dick and Smith didn’t respond to emailed requests for comment. Senator Patty Murray would also support the site’s construction of this facility on this location as early as 2002. Smith later opposed the GEO Group’s facility receiving another contract. Murray later scrutinized the facility, but nonetheless had accepted campaign contributions from the GEO Group in the amount of $5,000 in 2016. Senator Murray and her staff didn’t respond to emailed requests for comment for this story. Along with Representative Pramila Jayapal, Smith wrote a letter in July 2024 to the then-secretary of DHS urging it to move away from the use of private for-profit migrant detention facilities. Jayapal previously founded a non-profit organization that partnered with the Seattle University School of Law to produce a report on the human rights abuses at the facility. The city council adopted a resolution approving the facility on March 28, 2000, stating, “CSC [GEO Group] has an excellent reputation in the communities where it has facilities.” However, a local news report published in 2004, when the facility was being finished and opened, cited a 1995 riot at another GEO-acquired facility (under the name of Esmor Correctional Services) in New Jersey that led to a federal investigation. “Three guards at the facility were later convicted of misconduct and sent to prison,” a Tacoma News Tribune report stated as the Northwest Detention Center was about to open. Between 2018 and 2024, GEO Group paid Pierce County, where the detention facility is located, roughly $5,643,100 in property taxes. The city responded to questions about the total amount paid by GEO Group in business and occupation taxes, stating that such information could not be divulged because it is confidential. The GEO Group, Inc., based in Boca Raton, Florida, has received $6.85 billion since July 2009 from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which, since 2003, has included ICE. $995.08 million of this has been obligated to the GEO Group in Washington state. Congress’s 2025 Trump-supported continuing resolution allocates nearly $10 billion for ICE. The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) estimated that the continuing resolution allocates approximately $350 billion for immigration enforcement and argues, however, that it does not include checks and balances on Trump’s mass detention and deportation plans, nor allow for a legal pathway to citizenship. “Under our legal system, the rule of law also requires fairness and respect for due process, but the Trump-controlled Senate rejected any proposal to inject those principles into the bill passed yesterday,” stated AILA Executive Director Ben Johnson in a press release. Trump has recently defied court orders regarding the detention and deportation of migrants, invoking a law used to justify the internment of Japanese-Americans, German-Americans, and Italian-Americans during World War II to loosely classify some Venezuelans as members of Tren de Aragua, a gang designated as a foreign terrorist organization by his administration, without due process of law. Trump’s framing of non-white migrants as criminals and subhuman since his political rise in 2015 has served as the basis for his policies that disproportionately target vulnerable non-white people who once immigrated to the U.S. Meanwhile, those within the financial industry are profiting from the Trump Administration’s policies’ “potential sea change.” GEO Group’s top five shareholders are BlackRock, Inc., Vanguard Group, Inc., Wolf Hill Capital Management, LP, FMR, LLC, and Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2024. Pam Bondi, Trump’s current Attorney General, was formerly a lobbyist for the GEO Group, which has contributed over $2.7 billion to Trump and Republicans from 2016 to 2024, including members of Congress who voted against certifying the 2020 election and promoted the Big Lie that the election was stolen. Two days after Trump’s re-election on November 5th, 2024, GEO Group Executive Chairman George Zoley told his company’s shareholders during an earnings call that Trump’s “more aggressive policy” toward interior and border immigration enforcement means a “potential sea change” for the company he leads. “The GEO Group was built for this unique moment in our company’s—country’s history and the opportunities that it will bring,” Zoley said. He said GEO Group could increase the number of detainee beds from 13,500 to 31,000. In the days following Trump’s election, the value of GEO Group stock nearly doubled and peaked on January 21, 2025, Trump’s Inauguration Day. The apparent commoditization of human beings, in addition to allegations that migrants detained are essentially forced labor, is reminiscent of some of the darkest chapters of human history. Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, recently suggested Trump’s aspirational deportation machine should run more like a business, treating people like products being shipped. Before and between Trump’s terms, Democrats also sought to expand the role of DHS and ICE. The Biden administration took actions to expand immigration detention prior to the end of his term. Then Vice President and two-time presidential candidate Harris clearly stated her opposition to migration from Central and South America when, in June 2021, she spoke in Guatemala, unequivocally, saying to potential migrants, “Do not come. Do not come.” La Resistencia has dedicated over eleven years to shutting down the migrant detention center. Its Founder, Maru Mora-Villalpando, grew up in Mexico and was influenced by strong leaders, including her mother and grandfather, a union leader. They taught her the importance of supporting laborers on strike, which, she said, was common in Mexico. She recalled working to support striking workers by getting on a public bus, shaking a can with coins, requesting donations while talking with people about the importance of supporting striking workers, and passing out informational flyers. She also recalled riding with her mother and passing a group of striking workers when she was young. Their flag was grayed from age, and her mother said this was because of how long they’d been fighting, adding, “We also need to support them. In order for them to win, we all need to support them.” “They end[ed] up winning,” she said. ICE has allegedly targeted Mora-Villalpando specifically, as well as other activists, including, more recently, Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez Zeferino, a farm labor rights activist who is currently being detained at the GEO Group facility. According to a lawsuit filed, in part, on her behalf as well as on behalf of other activists allegedly targeted by ICE, Mora-Villalpando was surveilled, then explicitly targeted by ICE, which initiated deportation proceedings against her, specifically for her activism defending human and immigrant rights. DHS ultimately dropped deportation charges against Mora-Villalpando. The lawsuit is ongoing. On September 15, 2024, La Resistencia posted on Instagram stating, “URGENT. Yesterday a woman in the women’s unit at NWDC suffered [a] fainting [sic] and headaches that were caused by a strong smell of gas. #GEO staff failed to address this issue.” According to Mora-Villalpando, this woman was taken for medical observation and returned an hour later. People detained and impacted said the strong smell of gas and sulfur was unbearable. They thought it was coming from the air conditioning vent, mentioning the door to the yard was left open because of it. According to detained people, one GEO officer said they, too, were suffering from a headache due to the smell of gas. Other GEO officers who later came into the unit stated they couldn’t smell anything, according to detained persons familiar with the event, who opined it was because they didn’t want to acknowledge a possible gas leak. Unit B-3 is located in the northernmost part of the detention facility, where groundwater and soil monitoring and tests have revealed for over 30 years the presence of diesel fuel and heavy oil. More recently, on a video posted on March 12, a person detained at the GEO Group’s facility stated via video chat to leaders of La Resistencia that clothes coming back laundered are still wet, smell like mildew, and “smell like diesel fuel.” The laundry room is also located in the northernmost part of the detention facility. Mora-Villalpando stated that a fire occurred in this area the previous year, which she and others witnessed while outside in solidarity. According to Mora-Villalpando and Liliana Chumpitasi, leader and community organizer with La Resistencia, these instances weren’t the first time detainees smelled gas in the facility. The group reported to The Margin that detained people identified the smell of gas when the sinks were clogged, and water was leaking from above the showers. In another incident detailed by the group, detained people communicated to La Resistencia that a gas smell also came from the showers. Per a 2024 lawsuit, the Washington State Department of Health has fielded over 700 complaints in the past year from people detained in the GEO Group’s facility, including reports that “the water is brown and possibly contaminated.” The project lead of the state’s toxics cleanup of the Chevron bulk terminal facility, Thomas Praisewater, stated in an interview with The Margin that while he has not heard about any toxins, it is hypothetically possible these toxins have infiltrated the detention facility’s drinking water. Praisewater has been working with Chevron’s consultant, AECOM, on the cleanup of the bulk fuel storage and distribution facility that was once across the street, a site now occupied by vehicles used by ICE and GEO. Another expert has also said petroleum products may have made their way up through the soil and into the detention facility’s water pipes. Marc A. Edwards, a Distinguished Professor in environmental and water resources engineering at Virginia Tech, told The Margin that gas and other petroleum products can go through or diffuse through porous plastic water pipes. Edwards, who worked on the scientific team that found lead contamination in the drinking water of Flint, Michigan, said, in particular, polyethylene pipes are susceptible to such infiltration. Praisewater made similar statements that if there is, in fact, contamination, it would likely be because of a break or corrosion in the detention facility’s water system. Furthermore, it is unclear if GEO Group installed vapor intrusion barriers, rather than vapor barriers; the former being designed to potentially prevent infiltration of toxic chemicals. A 2009 toxicological evaluation by the EPA of the NWDC indicated that a vapor intrusion barrier was not installed. The City of Tacoma water department told The Margin that municipal water piped to the facility is clean. According to records from the City of Tacoma in 2009 and 2010, the city approved occupancy permits for renovations to the building based on GEO Group’s detention facility building permit, which meets the 2006 International Building Code standards, requiring third-party certified plastic pipes that conform to NSF 14 standards. NSF 14 standards include polyethylene pipes. The Margin is waiting for the release of records requested via state open records laws from the city to further determine the potential water contamination. Despite state legislation requiring the Washington State Department of Health to monitor air and water quality in facilities such as the GEO Group’s detention facility that was signed into law May 11, 2023 as House Bill 1470, the company has fought and denied at least four attempts to inspect the water in all parts of the facility, only allowing access to the lobby and its bathroom. The state health department attempted to test the water in the detention facility but was denied access by GEO facility administrators acting on behalf of ICE supervisors. Joe Wesley Barbee, Jr., the distribution optimization advisor for the operations and training section of the state health department office of drinking water, stated in a declaration included in a lawsuit filed by the state against the GEO Group, that the Department of Health received complaints from individuals detained in GEO Group’s facility between April 2023 and mid-July 2024. Barbee described these complaints as being about the water’s temperature, color, smell, and the absence of water from faucets. “Detainees have complained about incidents where there is no water to drink, flush toilets, or otherwise use, and other incidents where the tap water is brown,” he stated. But when Barbee arrived at the GEO Group’s facility, he was met by the facility administrator, Bruce Scott, and two unidentified people, who allowed him only to test water from a faucet in a restroom near the front lounge area, apart from the secured part of the facility where detainees are held. “The testing environment was under intense scrutiny by the facility staff and the supervisor, who asked questions about every step and every chemical/reagent I used,” Barbee stated in the lawsuit. He added that typically, a water test in a bathroom sink wouldn’t be acceptable for quality tests. “The administrator asked for identical samples of any water I took,” Barbee said.“I welcome them to prove us wrong, but they closed their doors even more,” said Representative Lillian Ortiz-Self (WA-21), who introduced House Bill 1232 in the state legislature that amends parts of House Bill 1470, which a federal judge partly blocked, saying it singled out GEO Group. HB 1232, which amended the law to include other facilities, was passed by the legislature on April 14 along party lines and signed into law by Governor Bob Ferguson on May 12. Part of the current legislation would require the Department of Health to specifically investigate complaints, monitor air and water quality, and publicly report findings on routine unannounced inspections of the facility, and to post these results in multiple languages for detainees and the public. It would also expand the facilities it covers to facilities other than the GEO Group detention facility in Tacoma. GEO Group had argued that HB 1470 was unconstitutional, alleging it violated the Constitution’s supremacy clause, stating ICE was the authority that denied the state access to the entire facility. “They have refused to be more transparent, and instead, the complaints have doubled and continue to increase. We continue to have hunger strikes and complaints and suicide attempts,” Rep. Ortiz-Self told The Margin. “A couple questions come to mind: How much money do you want to make off of people suffering? And you know we’re looking at you, so do you care that little that you think you can continue to treat people this way? And if you’re treating them that way, knowing that we have our eyes on you, what’s really happening inside? We’re really scared for everyone that’s in there,” she said. “What are they hiding?” Rep. Ortiz-Self asked. U.S. Marshals have recently confirmed a separate GEO Group detention facility in Laredo, Texas, to be exposing detainees to carbon monoxide, which families of the detainees allege sicken detainees without adequate medical treatment. GEO Group previously denied the presence of the deadly gas. The local fire department required GEO Group to take corrective action, according to an April 17th KGNS news report. In addition to having no choice but to drink potentially contaminated water, independent experts have alleged human rights abuses in complaints since the GEO detention facility was first opened in 2004. A 2008 report by OneAmerica and the International Human Rights Clinic at Seattle University School of Law identified major issues, including the unnecessary detention of refugees, conditions violating legal due process protections, especially the forced signing of papers, lack of access to attorneys, and failure to ensure confidential communications. Other concerns included overcrowding and lack of privacy, inadequate emergency medical care and pain management, inhuman and degrading treatment by guards and U.S. Marshals, failure to adequately address mental health issues and punitive segregation of those with mental health problems, extremely poor quality and quantity of food, inadequate visitation time, and long waits and inadequate access to telephones. Several reports by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights (UWCHR) have documented similar abuses since then. These include complaints of being served uncooked or worm-infested food, allegations of medical neglect, extensive use of solitary confinement, COVID-19 response and health standard issues, reports of sexual assault and abuse going unanswered, and complaints about the use of force and chemical agents. Suicide attempts at the facility are another especially significant issue. The UWCHR obtained 911 calls and detailed at least six suicide attempts from January 1 to March 18, 2024, alone. From August 2017 to April 2023, the UWCHR identified at least an additional 12 suicide attempts as categorized by South Sound 911. A man with Russian citizenship who was seeking asylum died following a suicide attempt while detained in segregation (or what UWCHR would define as solitary confinement). Records of 911 calls obtained by The Margin via open records law detail at least an additional eight suicide attempts since April 2023. In one of the most recent attempts on February 9, 2025, a detention facility representative tells a 911 dispatcher that medical assistance is needed for a man who had cut his wrists. A 2024 report by the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman found the detention center did not consistently complete 15-minute checks of detainees on suicide watch, and did not strictly control and collect disposable razors. Another 911 call obtained by The Margin via open records law details a man who had hit his head “multiple times” on the wall. In yet another recent suicide attempt, on March 12, a man jumped off the upper tier to the lower tier, according to a 911 audio recording obtained by The Margin. This audio contains sensitive material that may be distressing to some listeners, including discussions of violence, trauma, or strong language. 911 Records obtained by The Margin via public records law give a very general description of numerous other incidents, including 17 calls regarding molestation/groping from October 2021 through January 2025, and six calls alleging rape from February 2023 through June 2024. In a report published in 2022, the UWCHR reviewed several data sources from approximately 2012 to 2019 and found 63 reports of sexual assault or abuse. These included allegations by detainees against other detainees, alleged harassment by a GEO Group officer, and alleged sexual assault by medical staff. More recently, on April 24, UWCHR published a report finding the City of Tacoma Police Department failed to respond to allegations of assault and sexual assault made by detainees. A City of Tacoma spokesperson provided the following response via email: “We are currently reviewing the concerns outlined in the report recently published by the University of Washington. If our review identifies opportunities to better align with our mission in serving those at the [NWDC], we are committed to making necessary improvements and further strengthening our procedures. Our goal is to ensure that safety, security, and respect for rights remain central to our role.” People detained at the NWDC have also died there. On March 7, 2024, Charles Leo Daniel died while in solitary confinement of undetermined causes. According to UWHRC, Daniel had spent nearly the entirety of his four years at the NWDC in solitary confinement despite being classified as having significant mental illness. La Resistencia told The Margin Senator Patty Murray was touring the facility the day of his death. On October 27, 2024, Jose Manuel Sanchez-Castro also died at the NWDC. According to reporting by The Seattle Times, he was in fentanyl withdrawal. Yet autopsy results have yet to be released. In 2018, another person died by suicide at the NWDC, according to a press release from Rep. Jayapal, who stated that when she visited the facility following Daniel’s death, she wasn’t allowed to speak with detained people. Angelina Godoy, Director of the UWCHR, told The Margin there’s a total lack of accountability regarding the GEO Group’s detention facility in Tacoma because the systems that are there to provide accountability, such as Congress, have utterly failed, “to take any effective action to ensure that conditions within the Northwest Detention Center are even up to ICE’s own standards, which would fall far below international human rights standards.” The recent UWCHR report states “Conditions are critical within the NWDC today, and outside facility walls, we are all witness to a still-unfolding series of federal government policies that revel in the cruel and public dehumanization of immigrants.” The state’s lawsuit against the GEO Group, which seeks to prevent GEO Group from denying the entry of state officials under state law to investigate complaints, states, “As alleged, these complaints present clear threats to detainee health and safety at [the detention facility].” The Margin has requested these complaints via state public records law but has yet to receive them. The Washington State Department of Health, currently in litigation with the GEO Group, has declined to provide an interview to The Margin on the matter. A Washington State Department of Health spokesperson stated in an emailed response to The Margin: “The Washington State Department of Health is aware of many of these and other complaints. We are committed to gain entry to the facility and investigate these complaints. The Northwest ICE Processing Center continues to deny entry to our staff. We are hopeful that the federal courts will bring clarity to the department’s authority and that the facility will allow entry for investigations, transparency, and the welfare of all people inside the facility.” A GEO Group Spokesperson provided the following response via email: “The support services GEO provides at… the Northwest ICE Processing Center, are governed by ICE’s detention standards. GEO’s services are carefully monitored for quality by ICE personnel, who are onsite 24/7… The locations where GEO supports ICE are also independently accredited by the American Correctional Association, as well as the National Commission on Correctional Health Care…” A GEO Group spokesperson further stated via email: “GEO strongly disagrees with the allegations that have been made regarding the services we provide at the Northwest ICE Processing Center. These allegations are part of a long-standing, politically motivated, and radical campaign to abolish ICE and end federal immigration detention by attacking the federal government’s immigration facility contractors. GEO has comprehensive policies in place for the reporting and investigation of all incidents that occur at the Center, including instances of assault and/or sexual assault. These policies are governed by Performance-Based National Detention Standards (“PBNDS”) established by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.” The GEO Group provided these general responses, but did not respond to The Margin’s detailed questions. “That’s what detention centers are… an extension of the prison system.” Rufina Reyes, director of La Resistencia, hails from Guerrero state, Mexico. She emigrated to the U.S. in 2000 because of a lack of economic opportunity. “I’m Mexican,” Reyes said through an interpreter. “I’m an immigrant. I consider myself undocumented. I’m a mom, I’m a wife, and I believe that most of the people that are in La Resistencia are here because we have been affected by the system.” Reyes has held a work permit for the past two years. Reyes’ brother fled his home in Mexico following his kidnapping by a local organized crime group. Fortunately, he was released, unlike many others, according to Reyes, who have been disappeared. He came to the U.S. and was later detained in the NWDC. She went to find her brother at the detention center, and when she came out, La Resistencia was holding an action outside. She began volunteering with La Resistencia, answering phone calls on the group’s hotline. Some of the most impactful calls, she said, were those in which the person on the other end of the line said that they wanted to harm themselves or when she found out one person had died inside. This intimacy with despair and injustice catalyzed her, and she realized she had to do something more about it. “I have to continue fighting this, not just for my brother, but because possibly one day also I may be in there, and so I want to keep fighting for every single person that is not able to defend themselves,” she said. In addition to the violence and corruption of her home state, climate change has brought intensified cycles of drought and flooding that have made it extremely difficult for people to subsistence farm or grow food to sell there. As a result, so many have been forced to migrate, she added. Climate change impacts have been overwhelmingly driven by countries of the Global North, including the U.S. Reyes recounted how Mora-Villalpando reached out to her when she walked out of the detention facility in Tacoma after visiting her brother. “She told me who she was, she offered support, and she told me a little bit about what the people were talking about, the conditions inside. She said, ‘You’re not alone. Here’s my number. Call me if anything comes up,” Reyes said. Reyes has since risen through the ranks of La Resistencia to direct the Organization, as Mora-Villalpando has transitioned to an advisory position. “I call it a detention center because everybody knows them as detention centers, but they’re cages,” Mora-Villalpando said. “That’s the result of allowing governments to decide who’s worthy of what. If you are forced to migrate, you’re already being shaped into what you’re supposed to be, what you’re supposed to have, and what you’re not supposed to have, and what you don’t have is because ‘you deserve it,’” she said ironically. She said an ideology is formed where people agree that some people deserve to be caged. “That’s what detention centers are,” she said. “I’ve always said they’re an extension of the prison system.” In this case, the private, for-profit prison system.“The idea has been not only how these white invaders took over our continents,” she added, “but how they continue to be exploiting. They already have our land, they already have our labor, they already have our mind, and now they want to have our bodies to further capital—by having these cages, these storage places, where you [store] people like boxes, and you still make money off them,” she concluded.

This story was produced by The Margin in collaboration with The Nation.Please note this article contains mention of suicide, self-harm, and sexual violence. Near gale force winds stretched nimbostratus clouds that resembled alpine peaks turned sideways above the heavily industrialized zone known as the Tacoma Tideflats on a Saturday afternoon in mid-March. Concertina wire spiraled down the top of the chain-link fence marking the western edge of E. J Street. A nearby train engine billowed diesel exhaust, contaminating the wind. Its unmistakable stench stung the nostrils. Reflections of the compound buildings appeared in pools of rainwater and pulsed and blurred with each passing breeze. From the south, a big wind rose, slanting heavy raindrops against a group of some 40 protesters led by La Resistencia. They stood together with protest signs that folded and unfolded in the wind and rain. Inside soaked jackets, members and allies of the activist organization stood in solidarity against the Northwest ICE Processing Center, also known as the Northwest Detention Center, which is owned by The GEO Group and is contracted by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), which is within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The facility houses all genders. The detention center imprisons people who are suspected of violating civil immigration laws. While immigrants detained in the facility are from countries across the globe, many are from Latin America, one of several regions that has felt the brunt of European colonization and American imperialism. The impacts of these forces have made life in the countries unlivable for many, forcing people to migrate. However, when they reach the borders of the countries, including the United States, which have contributed to or caused their displacement, they are met with hostility and immigration policies that turn their plight into profit. The GEO Group acquired Corrections Services Corporation and its detention facility in a heavily industrialized area, allegedly exposing immigrants to numerous sources of pollution. Over nearly 30 years, numerous test pits and groundwater monitoring wells, both immediately adjacent to and beneath the detention facility site, have revealed the presence of petroleum products, including diesel, gasoline, and heavy oil. Furthermore, the detention facility has a notorious reputation due to years of documented human rights abuses. Despite these man-made forces, La Resistencia movement leaders and their allies are standing up to fight the facility and what it represents, mindful of those who’ve been targeted and whose rights have been taken, just as so many of their ancestors’ labor, land, and natural resources were—and continue to be—taken. The GEO Group is paid by the federal government to house people there, and is guaranteed a minimum number of detainees, causing the people detained in the facility to be valued as commodities. As the rain continued to pour, the protesters were quickly drenched, yet they remained, resolute and unified in their demands. Rufina Reyes, director of the La Resistencia, led the group by declaring: “¡No están solo!” Her voice was amplified loud enough for the sound waves to echo off the detention facility’s walls. The crowd echoed in unison, “You are not alone!” The sound waves of the calls interweaved like a multilingual prayer sanctified by the heavy rain and wind.“We’re opposed to detentions and deportations, and we don’t want any more family separation!” Reyes shouted through an interpreter. The volcanic mountain known as Tahoma towered above the valley and flatlands. Prior to the construction of the GEO Group’s detention facility, the site was a rich tidal estuary, known by many names, and was the ancestral homeland of the Puyallup people since time immemorial. Following colonization, conflict, and the eventual signing of the Treaty of Medicine Creek in 1854, the land was settled by American immigrants. Still, the Puyallup Tribe retains certain rights over the area as a result of the 1854 treaty and the subsequent Land Claims Settlement Act of 1990. In the immediate area where the detention facility would be built, fill was brought in or dredged from the river estuary to serve as a foundation for a meat processing and packing plant that opened in 1904, a Standard Oil fuel storage and distribution facility that opened in 1905, and a coal gasification plant that opened in 1924. The coal gasification plant operated until 1956 and was demolished in 1966. The fuel storage and distribution facility, later owned by Chevron, operated through 1988 and included 13 above-ground and four underground fuel storage tanks, three petroleum pipelines, and numerous garages. The GEO Group now owns the site and parks its vehicles on it. A metals recycling facility was constructed immediately southeast of the future detention site by 1967. This facility recycled cars and electrical transformers, polluting the area with PCBs and heavy metals. The coal gasification site, the meatpacking site, and the metals recycling site would later be designated as a Superfund site by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The Washington State Department of Ecology has stated that the EPA Superfund site around the detention facility is remediated, “capped” by layers of supposedly impermeable barriers, asphalt, and crumbled cement from the meatpacking facility. It now resembles an innocuous mound covered, bizarrely, in green grass. But an underground benzene plume exists just below the surface, not far from the southern edge of the property line where the detention facility now stands. In 1988, a 3,500-gallon underground oil storage tank had to be removed, and along with it, 376 tons (752,000 pounds) of petroleum-affected soil and over 8,000 gallons of petroleum-affected groundwater. Yet more remained. Adding to the petroleum contamination, the nearby Standard Oil facility, which Chevron now owns, leaked petroleum products into the soil, contaminating the surrounding groundwater. Washington state Department of Ecology’s groundwater monitoring wells have detected diesel and heavy oil in wells just outside the walls of the detention facility as recently as November 2024. MTCA Method A Cleanup Levels is a regulatory approach used under Washington State’s Model Toxics Control Act (MTCA) to establish acceptable levels of contaminants in soil, groundwater, and other environmental media during site cleanups. In 1996, Correction Services Corporation, now owned by GEO Group, began searching for a site to build a migrant detention facility near Seattle. After considering several locations in neighboring towns, they ultimately landed on 1623 E. J Street in Tacoma. Then Tacoma City Council member Kevin Phelps was a vocal supporter of this location, citing economic benefits, specifically business and occupation taxes the city would garner. GEO Group was issued contract revenue bonds by The Washington Economic Development Finance Authority in 2003 for $57,415,000 and in 2011 for $54,375,000 to construct and expand the facility. Washington Representatives at the time, Adam Smith and Norm Dicks worked alongside Tacoma city leaders to persuade GEO Group to seek to build the facility atop the Superfund site. Dick and Smith didn’t respond to emailed requests for comment. Senator Patty Murray would also support the site’s construction of this facility on this location as early as 2002. Smith later opposed the GEO Group’s facility receiving another contract. Murray later scrutinized the facility, but nonetheless had accepted campaign contributions from the GEO Group in the amount of $5,000 in 2016. Senator Murray and her staff didn’t respond to emailed requests for comment for this story. Along with Representative Pramila Jayapal, Smith wrote a letter in July 2024 to the then-secretary of DHS urging it to move away from the use of private for-profit migrant detention facilities. Jayapal previously founded a non-profit organization that partnered with the Seattle University School of Law to produce a report on the human rights abuses at the facility. The city council adopted a resolution approving the facility on March 28, 2000, stating, “CSC [GEO Group] has an excellent reputation in the communities where it has facilities.” However, a local news report published in 2004, when the facility was being finished and opened, cited a 1995 riot at another GEO-acquired facility (under the name of Esmor Correctional Services) in New Jersey that led to a federal investigation. “Three guards at the facility were later convicted of misconduct and sent to prison,” a Tacoma News Tribune report stated as the Northwest Detention Center was about to open. Between 2018 and 2024, GEO Group paid Pierce County, where the detention facility is located, roughly $5,643,100 in property taxes. The city responded to questions about the total amount paid by GEO Group in business and occupation taxes, stating that such information could not be divulged because it is confidential. The GEO Group, Inc., based in Boca Raton, Florida, has received $6.85 billion since July 2009 from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which, since 2003, has included ICE. $995.08 million of this has been obligated to the GEO Group in Washington state. Congress’s 2025 Trump-supported continuing resolution allocates nearly $10 billion for ICE. The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) estimated that the continuing resolution allocates approximately $350 billion for immigration enforcement and argues, however, that it does not include checks and balances on Trump’s mass detention and deportation plans, nor allow for a legal pathway to citizenship. “Under our legal system, the rule of law also requires fairness and respect for due process, but the Trump-controlled Senate rejected any proposal to inject those principles into the bill passed yesterday,” stated AILA Executive Director Ben Johnson in a press release. Trump has recently defied court orders regarding the detention and deportation of migrants, invoking a law used to justify the internment of Japanese-Americans, German-Americans, and Italian-Americans during World War II to loosely classify some Venezuelans as members of Tren de Aragua, a gang designated as a foreign terrorist organization by his administration, without due process of law. Trump’s framing of non-white migrants as criminals and subhuman since his political rise in 2015 has served as the basis for his policies that disproportionately target vulnerable non-white people who once immigrated to the U.S. Meanwhile, those within the financial industry are profiting from the Trump Administration’s policies’ “potential sea change.” GEO Group’s top five shareholders are BlackRock, Inc., Vanguard Group, Inc., Wolf Hill Capital Management, LP, FMR, LLC, and Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2024. Pam Bondi, Trump’s current Attorney General, was formerly a lobbyist for the GEO Group, which has contributed over $2.7 billion to Trump and Republicans from 2016 to 2024, including members of Congress who voted against certifying the 2020 election and promoted the Big Lie that the election was stolen. Two days after Trump’s re-election on November 5th, 2024, GEO Group Executive Chairman George Zoley told his company’s shareholders during an earnings call that Trump’s “more aggressive policy” toward interior and border immigration enforcement means a “potential sea change” for the company he leads. “The GEO Group was built for this unique moment in our company’s—country’s history and the opportunities that it will bring,” Zoley said. He said GEO Group could increase the number of detainee beds from 13,500 to 31,000. In the days following Trump’s election, the value of GEO Group stock nearly doubled and peaked on January 21, 2025, Trump’s Inauguration Day. The apparent commoditization of human beings, in addition to allegations that migrants detained are essentially forced labor, is reminiscent of some of the darkest chapters of human history. Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, recently suggested Trump’s aspirational deportation machine should run more like a business, treating people like products being shipped. Before and between Trump’s terms, Democrats also sought to expand the role of DHS and ICE. The Biden administration took actions to expand immigration detention prior to the end of his term. Then Vice President and two-time presidential candidate Harris clearly stated her opposition to migration from Central and South America when, in June 2021, she spoke in Guatemala, unequivocally, saying to potential migrants, “Do not come. Do not come.” La Resistencia has dedicated over eleven years to shutting down the migrant detention center. Its Founder, Maru Mora-Villalpando, grew up in Mexico and was influenced by strong leaders, including her mother and grandfather, a union leader. They taught her the importance of supporting laborers on strike, which, she said, was common in Mexico. She recalled working to support striking workers by getting on a public bus, shaking a can with coins, requesting donations while talking with people about the importance of supporting striking workers, and passing out informational flyers. She also recalled riding with her mother and passing a group of striking workers when she was young. Their flag was grayed from age, and her mother said this was because of how long they’d been fighting, adding, “We also need to support them. In order for them to win, we all need to support them.” “They end[ed] up winning,” she said. ICE has allegedly targeted Mora-Villalpando specifically, as well as other activists, including, more recently, Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez Zeferino, a farm labor rights activist who is currently being detained at the GEO Group facility. According to a lawsuit filed, in part, on her behalf as well as on behalf of other activists allegedly targeted by ICE, Mora-Villalpando was surveilled, then explicitly targeted by ICE, which initiated deportation proceedings against her, specifically for her activism defending human and immigrant rights. DHS ultimately dropped deportation charges against Mora-Villalpando. The lawsuit is ongoing. On September 15, 2024, La Resistencia posted on Instagram stating, “URGENT. Yesterday a woman in the women’s unit at NWDC suffered [a] fainting [sic] and headaches that were caused by a strong smell of gas. #GEO staff failed to address this issue.” According to Mora-Villalpando, this woman was taken for medical observation and returned an hour later. People detained and impacted said the strong smell of gas and sulfur was unbearable. They thought it was coming from the air conditioning vent, mentioning the door to the yard was left open because of it. According to detained people, one GEO officer said they, too, were suffering from a headache due to the smell of gas. Other GEO officers who later came into the unit stated they couldn’t smell anything, according to detained persons familiar with the event, who opined it was because they didn’t want to acknowledge a possible gas leak. Unit B-3 is located in the northernmost part of the detention facility, where groundwater and soil monitoring and tests have revealed for over 30 years the presence of diesel fuel and heavy oil. More recently, on a video posted on March 12, a person detained at the GEO Group’s facility stated via video chat to leaders of La Resistencia that clothes coming back laundered are still wet, smell like mildew, and “smell like diesel fuel.” The laundry room is also located in the northernmost part of the detention facility. Mora-Villalpando stated that a fire occurred in this area the previous year, which she and others witnessed while outside in solidarity. According to Mora-Villalpando and Liliana Chumpitasi, leader and community organizer with La Resistencia, these instances weren’t the first time detainees smelled gas in the facility. The group reported to The Margin that detained people identified the smell of gas when the sinks were clogged, and water was leaking from above the showers. In another incident detailed by the group, detained people communicated to La Resistencia that a gas smell also came from the showers. Per a 2024 lawsuit, the Washington State Department of Health has fielded over 700 complaints in the past year from people detained in the GEO Group’s facility, including reports that “the water is brown and possibly contaminated.” The project lead of the state’s toxics cleanup of the Chevron bulk terminal facility, Thomas Praisewater, stated in an interview with The Margin that while he has not heard about any toxins, it is hypothetically possible these toxins have infiltrated the detention facility’s drinking water. Praisewater has been working with Chevron’s consultant, AECOM, on the cleanup of the bulk fuel storage and distribution facility that was once across the street, a site now occupied by vehicles used by ICE and GEO. Another expert has also said petroleum products may have made their way up through the soil and into the detention facility’s water pipes. Marc A. Edwards, a Distinguished Professor in environmental and water resources engineering at Virginia Tech, told The Margin that gas and other petroleum products can go through or diffuse through porous plastic water pipes. Edwards, who worked on the scientific team that found lead contamination in the drinking water of Flint, Michigan, said, in particular, polyethylene pipes are susceptible to such infiltration. Praisewater made similar statements that if there is, in fact, contamination, it would likely be because of a break or corrosion in the detention facility’s water system. Furthermore, it is unclear if GEO Group installed vapor intrusion barriers, rather than vapor barriers; the former being designed to potentially prevent infiltration of toxic chemicals. A 2009 toxicological evaluation by the EPA of the NWDC indicated that a vapor intrusion barrier was not installed. The City of Tacoma water department told The Margin that municipal water piped to the facility is clean. According to records from the City of Tacoma in 2009 and 2010, the city approved occupancy permits for renovations to the building based on GEO Group’s detention facility building permit, which meets the 2006 International Building Code standards, requiring third-party certified plastic pipes that conform to NSF 14 standards. NSF 14 standards include polyethylene pipes. The Margin is waiting for the release of records requested via state open records laws from the city to further determine the potential water contamination. Despite state legislation requiring the Washington State Department of Health to monitor air and water quality in facilities such as the GEO Group’s detention facility that was signed into law May 11, 2023 as House Bill 1470, the company has fought and denied at least four attempts to inspect the water in all parts of the facility, only allowing access to the lobby and its bathroom. The state health department attempted to test the water in the detention facility but was denied access by GEO facility administrators acting on behalf of ICE supervisors. Joe Wesley Barbee, Jr., the distribution optimization advisor for the operations and training section of the state health department office of drinking water, stated in a declaration included in a lawsuit filed by the state against the GEO Group, that the Department of Health received complaints from individuals detained in GEO Group’s facility between April 2023 and mid-July 2024. Barbee described these complaints as being about the water’s temperature, color, smell, and the absence of water from faucets. “Detainees have complained about incidents where there is no water to drink, flush toilets, or otherwise use, and other incidents where the tap water is brown,” he stated. But when Barbee arrived at the GEO Group’s facility, he was met by the facility administrator, Bruce Scott, and two unidentified people, who allowed him only to test water from a faucet in a restroom near the front lounge area, apart from the secured part of the facility where detainees are held. “The testing environment was under intense scrutiny by the facility staff and the supervisor, who asked questions about every step and every chemical/reagent I used,” Barbee stated in the lawsuit. He added that typically, a water test in a bathroom sink wouldn’t be acceptable for quality tests. “The administrator asked for identical samples of any water I took,” Barbee said.“I welcome them to prove us wrong, but they closed their doors even more,” said Representative Lillian Ortiz-Self (WA-21), who introduced House Bill 1232 in the state legislature that amends parts of House Bill 1470, which a federal judge partly blocked, saying it singled out GEO Group. HB 1232, which amended the law to include other facilities, was passed by the legislature on April 14 along party lines and signed into law by Governor Bob Ferguson on May 12. Part of the current legislation would require the Department of Health to specifically investigate complaints, monitor air and water quality, and publicly report findings on routine unannounced inspections of the facility, and to post these results in multiple languages for detainees and the public. It would also expand the facilities it covers to facilities other than the GEO Group detention facility in Tacoma. GEO Group had argued that HB 1470 was unconstitutional, alleging it violated the Constitution’s supremacy clause, stating ICE was the authority that denied the state access to the entire facility. “They have refused to be more transparent, and instead, the complaints have doubled and continue to increase. We continue to have hunger strikes and complaints and suicide attempts,” Rep. Ortiz-Self told The Margin. “A couple questions come to mind: How much money do you want to make off of people suffering? And you know we’re looking at you, so do you care that little that you think you can continue to treat people this way? And if you’re treating them that way, knowing that we have our eyes on you, what’s really happening inside? We’re really scared for everyone that’s in there,” she said. “What are they hiding?” Rep. Ortiz-Self asked. U.S. Marshals have recently confirmed a separate GEO Group detention facility in Laredo, Texas, to be exposing detainees to carbon monoxide, which families of the detainees allege sicken detainees without adequate medical treatment. GEO Group previously denied the presence of the deadly gas. The local fire department required GEO Group to take corrective action, according to an April 17th KGNS news report. In addition to having no choice but to drink potentially contaminated water, independent experts have alleged human rights abuses in complaints since the GEO detention facility was first opened in 2004. A 2008 report by OneAmerica and the International Human Rights Clinic at Seattle University School of Law identified major issues, including the unnecessary detention of refugees, conditions violating legal due process protections, especially the forced signing of papers, lack of access to attorneys, and failure to ensure confidential communications. Other concerns included overcrowding and lack of privacy, inadequate emergency medical care and pain management, inhuman and degrading treatment by guards and U.S. Marshals, failure to adequately address mental health issues and punitive segregation of those with mental health problems, extremely poor quality and quantity of food, inadequate visitation time, and long waits and inadequate access to telephones. Several reports by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights (UWCHR) have documented similar abuses since then. These include complaints of being served uncooked or worm-infested food, allegations of medical neglect, extensive use of solitary confinement, COVID-19 response and health standard issues, reports of sexual assault and abuse going unanswered, and complaints about the use of force and chemical agents. Suicide attempts at the facility are another especially significant issue. The UWCHR obtained 911 calls and detailed at least six suicide attempts from January 1 to March 18, 2024, alone. From August 2017 to April 2023, the UWCHR identified at least an additional 12 suicide attempts as categorized by South Sound 911. A man with Russian citizenship who was seeking asylum died following a suicide attempt while detained in segregation (or what UWCHR would define as solitary confinement). Records of 911 calls obtained by The Margin via open records law detail at least an additional eight suicide attempts since April 2023. In one of the most recent attempts on February 9, 2025, a detention facility representative tells a 911 dispatcher that medical assistance is needed for a man who had cut his wrists. A 2024 report by the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman found the detention center did not consistently complete 15-minute checks of detainees on suicide watch, and did not strictly control and collect disposable razors. Another 911 call obtained by The Margin via open records law details a man who had hit his head “multiple times” on the wall. In yet another recent suicide attempt, on March 12, a man jumped off the upper tier to the lower tier, according to a 911 audio recording obtained by The Margin. This audio contains sensitive material that may be distressing to some listeners, including discussions of violence, trauma, or strong language. 911 Records obtained by The Margin via public records law give a very general description of numerous other incidents, including 17 calls regarding molestation/groping from October 2021 through January 2025, and six calls alleging rape from February 2023 through June 2024. In a report published in 2022, the UWCHR reviewed several data sources from approximately 2012 to 2019 and found 63 reports of sexual assault or abuse. These included allegations by detainees against other detainees, alleged harassment by a GEO Group officer, and alleged sexual assault by medical staff. More recently, on April 24, UWCHR published a report finding the City of Tacoma Police Department failed to respond to allegations of assault and sexual assault made by detainees. A City of Tacoma spokesperson provided the following response via email: “We are currently reviewing the concerns outlined in the report recently published by the University of Washington. If our review identifies opportunities to better align with our mission in serving those at the [NWDC], we are committed to making necessary improvements and further strengthening our procedures. Our goal is to ensure that safety, security, and respect for rights remain central to our role.” People detained at the NWDC have also died there. On March 7, 2024, Charles Leo Daniel died while in solitary confinement of undetermined causes. According to UWHRC, Daniel had spent nearly the entirety of his four years at the NWDC in solitary confinement despite being classified as having significant mental illness. La Resistencia told The Margin Senator Patty Murray was touring the facility the day of his death. On October 27, 2024, Jose Manuel Sanchez-Castro also died at the NWDC. According to reporting by The Seattle Times, he was in fentanyl withdrawal. Yet autopsy results have yet to be released. In 2018, another person died by suicide at the NWDC, according to a press release from Rep. Jayapal, who stated that when she visited the facility following Daniel’s death, she wasn’t allowed to speak with detained people. Angelina Godoy, Director of the UWCHR, told The Margin there’s a total lack of accountability regarding the GEO Group’s detention facility in Tacoma because the systems that are there to provide accountability, such as Congress, have utterly failed, “to take any effective action to ensure that conditions within the Northwest Detention Center are even up to ICE’s own standards, which would fall far below international human rights standards.” The recent UWCHR report states “Conditions are critical within the NWDC today, and outside facility walls, we are all witness to a still-unfolding series of federal government policies that revel in the cruel and public dehumanization of immigrants.” The state’s lawsuit against the GEO Group, which seeks to prevent GEO Group from denying the entry of state officials under state law to investigate complaints, states, “As alleged, these complaints present clear threats to detainee health and safety at [the detention facility].” The Margin has requested these complaints via state public records law but has yet to receive them. The Washington State Department of Health, currently in litigation with the GEO Group, has declined to provide an interview to The Margin on the matter. A Washington State Department of Health spokesperson stated in an emailed response to The Margin: “The Washington State Department of Health is aware of many of these and other complaints. We are committed to gain entry to the facility and investigate these complaints. The Northwest ICE Processing Center continues to deny entry to our staff. We are hopeful that the federal courts will bring clarity to the department’s authority and that the facility will allow entry for investigations, transparency, and the welfare of all people inside the facility.” A GEO Group Spokesperson provided the following response via email: “The support services GEO provides at… the Northwest ICE Processing Center, are governed by ICE’s detention standards. GEO’s services are carefully monitored for quality by ICE personnel, who are onsite 24/7… The locations where GEO supports ICE are also independently accredited by the American Correctional Association, as well as the National Commission on Correctional Health Care…” A GEO Group spokesperson further stated via email: “GEO strongly disagrees with the allegations that have been made regarding the services we provide at the Northwest ICE Processing Center. These allegations are part of a long-standing, politically motivated, and radical campaign to abolish ICE and end federal immigration detention by attacking the federal government’s immigration facility contractors. GEO has comprehensive policies in place for the reporting and investigation of all incidents that occur at the Center, including instances of assault and/or sexual assault. These policies are governed by Performance-Based National Detention Standards (“PBNDS”) established by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.” The GEO Group provided these general responses, but did not respond to The Margin’s detailed questions. “That’s what detention centers are… an extension of the prison system.” Rufina Reyes, director of La Resistencia, hails from Guerrero state, Mexico. She emigrated to the U.S. in 2000 because of a lack of economic opportunity. “I’m Mexican,” Reyes said through an interpreter. “I’m an immigrant. I consider myself undocumented. I’m a mom, I’m a wife, and I believe that most of the people that are in La Resistencia are here because we have been affected by the system.” Reyes has held a work permit for the past two years. Reyes’ brother fled his home in Mexico following his kidnapping by a local organized crime group. Fortunately, he was released, unlike many others, according to Reyes, who have been disappeared. He came to the U.S. and was later detained in the NWDC. She went to find her brother at the detention center, and when she came out, La Resistencia was holding an action outside. She began volunteering with La Resistencia, answering phone calls on the group’s hotline. Some of the most impactful calls, she said, were those in which the person on the other end of the line said that they wanted to harm themselves or when she found out one person had died inside. This intimacy with despair and injustice catalyzed her, and she realized she had to do something more about it. “I have to continue fighting this, not just for my brother, but because possibly one day also I may be in there, and so I want to keep fighting for every single person that is not able to defend themselves,” she said. In addition to the violence and corruption of her home state, climate change has brought intensified cycles of drought and flooding that have made it extremely difficult for people to subsistence farm or grow food to sell there. As a result, so many have been forced to migrate, she added. Climate change impacts have been overwhelmingly driven by countries of the Global North, including the U.S. Reyes recounted how Mora-Villalpando reached out to her when she walked out of the detention facility in Tacoma after visiting her brother. “She told me who she was, she offered support, and she told me a little bit about what the people were talking about, the conditions inside. She said, ‘You’re not alone. Here’s my number. Call me if anything comes up,” Reyes said. Reyes has since risen through the ranks of La Resistencia to direct the Organization, as Mora-Villalpando has transitioned to an advisory position. “I call it a detention center because everybody knows them as detention centers, but they’re cages,” Mora-Villalpando said. “That’s the result of allowing governments to decide who’s worthy of what. If you are forced to migrate, you’re already being shaped into what you’re supposed to be, what you’re supposed to have, and what you’re not supposed to have, and what you don’t have is because ‘you deserve it,’” she said ironically. She said an ideology is formed where people agree that some people deserve to be caged. “That’s what detention centers are,” she said. “I’ve always said they’re an extension of the prison system.” In this case, the private, for-profit prison system.“The idea has been not only how these white invaders took over our continents,” she added, “but how they continue to be exploiting. They already have our land, they already have our labor, they already have our mind, and now they want to have our bodies to further capital—by having these cages, these storage places, where you [store] people like boxes, and you still make money off them,” she concluded.

Gerrit Kazmaier on what AI can really do and the quest to make enterprise software suck less. by Nilay Patel If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Today, I’m talking with Gerrit Kazmaier, the new president of product and technology at Workday, an enterprise software company. Decoder listeners probably know the name Workday; a lot of companies use its platform for HR and finance management, which the suits have started bundling into a phrase they call “human capital management.” I invite you to have whatever feelings you want about that. Anyhow, if you’ve been applying to jobs lately, you have certainly run into Workday, and you are almost certainly frustrated with it. I mean, I’ll just say this from the jump: it’s rare that enterprise software executives come on this show, because it’s a guarantee that I will ask them why everyone hates enterprise software and what they’re doing to fix it. Workday is no exception; last year, Business Insider literally published an article titled “Everybody hates Workday.” Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! Gerrit’s new on the job, maybe a little bit braver than most, and, to his credit, he came on the show and took the heat. We spent a lot of time talking about what enterprise software really is, what it does, and why it has a reputation for being so deeply frustrating for so many people. As you’ll hear, the heart of this conversation is a major tension that exists between software as just a tool to get some work done and the idea that using a software tool is actually a job. And everyone experiences software like Workday in totally different ways across a company. I mean, just think about it: for most people in a company, Workday is mostly just a database, a series of forms they’re required to fill out to file expenses or log a performance review. For people who actually work in HR and finance, using Workday is actually their job. And then the C-suite, which makes a lot of decisions using data generated by tools like Workday, might never actually use the software at all, instead just looking at reports other people generate from it. You will not be totally surprised to hear that Gerrit’s solution to a lot of these issues is to use AI — after all, Workday now calls itself an “AI platform.” So I really wanted to know what Gerrit thinks about what role AI is going to play in workplace software and if letting AI fill out all those forms for people might make things better — or just result in bad data everywhere. And I really wanted to know how comfortable he was letting AI make decisions about finance and HR, because AI systems can have lots of bias built into them. That’s something lots of companies, including Workday, have already faced lawsuits over. Look, I told you there’s a reason enterprise software executives don’t come on this show often. So hats off to Gerrit for hanging in there — I think you’ll like this one. Okay: Gerrit Kazmaier, Workday’s president of product and technology. Here we go. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Gerrit Kazmaier, you’re the president of product and technology at Workday. Welcome to Decoder. Thank you for having me, Nilay. Excited to be here. I’m excited to talk to you for a variety of reasons. One, enterprise software executives don’t often want to come on the show because I just ask them about the nature of enterprise software, so you’re very brave. Thank you for coming on. And then second, you’re the new guy. You just started in March, so you don’t have to defend all the stuff that other people did. You can just be honest about it. Exactly. And hey, maybe you just don’t invite so many enterprise executives. So I don’t know. Maybe I can lure some more in. My threat is always that we’ll just use the software together live, but it’s an audio podcast, so don’t worry. We’re not going to do that today. Workday is one of those pieces of software that maybe everybody encounters in the course of their career. You apply to a job, Workday is the interface; you’re at a job, it’s your finance system. It’s “human capital management” — I think that’s what we call it now, when you’re doing your performance reviews. How do you think about Workday? What is this thing? So it’s this incredible system that helps organizations on the one side manage their people and manage their money, which is great. Well, two of the most important assets our corporation is built upon. But I think more importantly, like what you have said, right, when you think about everyday work experience, it’s the systems that everyone touches, everyone interacts with, and I think makes a huge difference in having a great work experience and ultimately great personal development and building a great career. So yeah, it’s a system of work and it’s very exciting to be here. There’s a lot of companies that want to describe themselves as the backbone of how you might do work. We had web service companies come on, Squarespace come on, and say we’re the operating system for small businesses. You book the class or you book the auto mechanic and then we’ll do the billing and finance. Workday is also expressed like that in some way, right? You’ve got people, you’ve got money, they’re moving through your system, they’re spending the money. You’re tracking what the people are doing and if they’re performing well. Do you want the big picture of, We’re running the entire business in Workday? You know, it’s funny, right, because I think that’s kind of an archaic way to think about systems and people altogether because actually enterprise software is an ecosystem. Organizations are large and touch many domains and people and money is important, but there is also customer, right? There is service. There are so many things, right? There are so many things that makes a company and there’s so many things that make a work experience that I’d argue that back in the old days, when you look into the, I don’t know, the legacy enterprise software systems, that they had this idea of that perfectly walled garden, and Hey, there’s going to be one door you enter in the morning and you’re going to stay in that door and we are going to give you what that system has to offer, and that’s it, right? And I think today’s reality is that it is not reflective of what makes a great enterprise software stack. You have a multitude of vendors offering different capabilities and you have to compose them together to reflect what really is important to your company. Secondly, I think it’s about the work experience, from people bringing their own devices today, now bringing in their own AI models, more often than not their own AI coding experiences, meaning that they also have way more agency about the systems they use and the systems they expect to use, right? So you have collaboration and productivity and that’s something very specialized and you have enterprise systems for all sorts of purposes, and I actually think it’s about an intelligent ecosystem and being part of — I would describe it as an enterprise software fabric, if you will, where it is really important that vendors like Workday work with other vendors in the industry and build that system so that customers can use them in orchestration without having that kind of ridiculous idea, right? “Oh, you get everything from one [vendor] and you have to be happy with that.” I mean, how would that work? I mean, you have a long career in enterprise software, but that is a trend across every enterprise business product that I’ve ever encountered, where you start with one part of the business and then the line everyone uses: We want to be the operating system for your business. We want to take everything. And it sounds like you’re just totally against that. I think I’m totally for a vibrant software ecosystem, and if you think about it, it starts with an operating system. I think that’s a great metaphor, but it’s also something that I think we have to evolve, right? Back in the old days when we said “operating system,” it was this monolithic piece and everything had to run on it. And then came along the web and suddenly, well, what you had on your operating system was not the only thing that you could use because when you were on your device you could access web services and online services, too. So when we say “operating system,” what is the operating system? You might say, “Well, it’s a specific software platform and only the things that run on it are allowed,” right? And I would say, “Well, I guess the operating system today is the browser and everything which relies on HTTP as part of my operating system ecosystem.” And in the AI world you might say it’s an operating system that is defined by MCP, or model context protocol, and we have an orchestration of agents. So I do think operating systems are important because they actually define how an ecosystem works. They define standards and they define very important shared interests, security being one of them. So those are all things that no one would want to give up on, but I don’t think they’re single-source, single-vendor, monolithic pieces anymore that just create one experience. I think I would say it’s a dated way of thinking about enterprise software, actually. There’s a real push and pull here and there’s a reason I’m starting in this kind of esoteric space. I think a lot about what work is, like what are we all doing? And in the age where there’s a big push and pull between remote work and in-office work and what those experiences are, so much of our jobs just every day is using software. You and I are talking right now through a piece of software called Riverside that is quite cranky, but on one very basic level, my job is just using Riverside a few times a week. The things I can do at my job are limited in some ways by Riverside, but they’re enabled in huge ways by the software existing. You see that with every kind of enterprise software, right? There are enormous numbers of HR and finance professionals who show up to work every day, and what they do is they use Workday in one way or another. There’s executives who receive reports from Workday and their job is just evaluating the information Workday has compiled for them and then making some decisions based on it. How do you see the role of the software there? Because what it looks like and how it works and what it’s for is all pretty dependent on the fact that some people’s jobs are just using the software. It’s an interesting way to think about a job, right? Because when you said, “It’s my job to use Riverside,” I actually thought maybe that’s not true. Maybe your job is asking powerful questions and talking to many people and creating a show that engages listeners. Riverside, the software piece that you have just mentioned, is just something that allows you to do your job really well, right? I think the same applies when we think about Workday. People have important jobs to do. They try to hire great candidates. Once they hire great candidates, they try to onboard them and train them in the way a company works. They want to build thriving organizations that let people have a really good work experience. They want to manage performance, and they want to reward and recognize people. Those are the jobs on the HR side. On the finance side, it’s as simple, right? You ship products, you want to write bills, and you have to pay bills, and you want to create a compliant profit-and-loss statement and you want to be financially responsible and viable in the long term and manage your cash position and so forth. And those are the jobs, right? Now, basically the question is what do you have available in terms of tools and software that allows you to do a job in the best possible way? That’s the core of Workday, right? Workday says that for the jobs that you have, which are software independent, which are emergent from the very core thing that you do as your value creation, we are going to give you the best services and products to everything related to people and money. I think that’s a very important focus to get this straight because sometimes I do think people get confused, specifically in technology. AI is a wonderful example of that, by the way. Because now some people think maybe the job is AI. Maybe that’s my job, to do something with AI, and there is a certain thrill and excitement that goes with that. But ultimately, there is a reason that when you look at studies… for instance, Stanford has that AI Index Report, and it’s a beautiful 400-page read on the state of AI, and part of that survey is that enterprise leaders get asked about their returns on the AI investment and the vast majority said AI gave them less than 5 percent top-line increase and less than 5 percent bottom-line efficiency. You wonder with all of that investment, how can that be? And I think ultimately it’s because there is a confusion that some people think, “Maybe that my job is AI,” but actually it’s not. The job is what you’re trying to do for your business, and AI may be a powerful way for you to do this job better, and for software vendors like Workday, it’s the same. How can we help people manage their money and people better through AI and being focused on the real job versus on the technical means that facilitates a certain way of doing that job? I saw a similar survey from IBM where they surveyed CEOs and the results were only 25 percent of the AI projects had returned on the investment. So we’re in this place where everyone’s spending the money, you guys are spending the money on AI — we’re going to talk about that — and no one knows why. I’m sure you have an answer. But I see that piece. Then there’s the other piece of AI. The reason people are investing so much money in it is because maybe the AI can use the software or maybe the AI will fill out the forms or, and this is the big promise, the AI will do the boring stuff. Workday, I think a lot of people have expressed, is the boring stuff in their job, right? They’re filling out expense reports or whatever. You have all the way up to agentic AI, which is actually doing stuff and making decisions. How do you see that interaction? Is AI going to use more and more of Workday for people? First of all, I would say Workday is the exciting stuff, so. [Laughs] You have to. I appreciate that you have to say that Workday is the exciting stuff. Because I think sometimes when we say, “What’s the exciting stuff?” I actually think... Well, like you said, I worked in enterprise software my entire career, but actually all of the enterprise software businesses that I was a part of, they’re people businesses 100 percent, right? You drive all of your work through and with people and teams. So managing that and growing and managing people, that’s an exciting part of the job and Workday is that system in which you make that happen. So this is why I’m saying it’s the exciting stuff — for me, Workday is more than doing a PTO request. But can I ask you about this? Yeah, of course. Managing people is the exciting part of the job, sure. As somebody who manages people, there are days I agree, there are days I disagree. I don’t think about this software as the management, right? And maybe it’s just that I work in a creative field and our conversations about management are very different, but there’s not a place where I’m like, “I’m going to use this software and that will accomplish a management task.” It’s much more like, “I’ve accomplished the management tasks and now I need to record it in this software just so I remember what happened.” But there’s a confusion there, right? I think whether or not what happens in the database is real life is maybe the central confusion of the entire tech industry across the board. It might be the central confusion at the highest levels of our government right now, but how do you see Workday closing that gap, if at all? Is it even possible to close that gap? I totally think it’s possible to close this gap. I see us having closed that gap and increasingly closed that gap in certain domains. But I completely agree with you, right? Work is so complex and it happens in so many ways, and it’s not, like I said earlier, it’s not that it’s all happening in one system only. It’s an ecosystem. So I completely agree with that point, and some of the work is even offline. Like you said, it’s talking to someone. As simple as that. But there are domains, for instance, like in the recruiting space. How do I build recruiting campaigns? How do I interview people? When I interview people, how do I select candidates that are best fit for the job on something more profound than pedigree, but skills, and skills that they have shown or skills that I can infer? Those are actions. This is work where work genuinely happens to a significant degree in a system like Workday. So it may not be happening everywhere, I agree with that, and maybe it shouldn’t even happen for everything everywhere. But there is a significant portion where professionals actually do their job in these systems and that’s why I think it’s so important to get them right. I haven’t had to use Workday in a long time, so to prepare for this interview, I watched a lot of Workday training videos on YouTube. Amazing ecosystem of Workday training videos on YouTube, I have to say. It just occurred to me as I was watching some of this stuff that Workday is expressed to people as a database very openly. It’s a database or maybe a spreadsheet in some of the other interfaces, and people applying to a job experience it as a series of forms to be filled out. Again, when I say, “You use the software to accomplish the task,” a lot of the task is making sure the database has the right information in it. That runs sort of headlong into AI, right? Now you’ve got people using AI to generate the information for the database or you’ve got an AI system that’s going to look at a receipt and figure out what it is and put it in the right fields. That’s a new kind of data risk there, where you’re definitely going to get all the fields filled in. If there’s one thing generative AI can do, it’s fill in the fields with little effort, but it might be hallucinations. It might be garbage. It might be worse than if a human didn’t fill out the field at all. How are you thinking about that risk? I think what you’re describing is a question of maturity, actually, of maturity in both ways, both technology and use. AI is undeniably the most profound change in technology, and I think we are just living through the beginning of a renaissance of what AI can deliver. In any domain — material, science, medicine, and enterprise software being just one of them — people are solving problems in incredible ways with the use of AI. As a person, between you and I, humankind has big challenges, very big challenges, and I think it’s a wonderful opportunity to have broken one of these big technology boundaries on reasoning and judgment and knowledge compression and being able to use that on virtually any domain that exists. So I think that is incredible. But what you just spoke about is the flip side of that, right? It’s new, and the reality is that we have intuitions about it. We have an intuition that a computer program is right because it’s deterministic, so there is an intuition that goes alongside using a computer. When you talk to a person, that is different because we know that we have biases, we get stuff wrong, and there’s a different type of intuition that we have than what we expect a computer program to do. Now we have these generative AI models and like you have said, they’re probabilistic. They’re not deterministic in many ways, and even very subtle things change their behavior and things that we wouldn’t expect them to do. It was just I think last week or the week before, this outcry of the latest OpenAI model, and I think it was called the sycophancy of it. Yeah. It was too nice. Yeah. [Laughs] Because it was too nice, and it was actually a few small changes that dramatically changed the behavior of the model, making it too nice and not really helpful anymore. So what you just spoke about, when we think about AI specifically in an enterprise context, I think the big point is that AI gets you to a lot of results really quickly. It’s so powerful, but in many ways it is really shallow. In the enterprise space, for instance, we take one of these very powerful models, we give it a really good prompt that is reflective of a business problem, and the model gives us something and it looks roughly good and we say, “Oh, yeah. We got it solved.” We are happy about that. But the reality is then you actually want to make it work with accuracy expectations that you need to have in order to be used in a professional context, or that someone makes mission-critical decisions upon. Or in cases, and this is very important, where someone cannot correct the model in a direct way. Coding is a good example. Why is coding successful? The model gives you something back in a modality that you understand as a coder, right? You know what the model is doing. You see the code. You have a chance to lean in. That’s why it took off so quickly there. Because you basically spoke the same language with the model and that was a big corrective. And in an enterprise system, like what you have said, you have to fill out this complex form for maybe a process that you don’t even fully understand yourself. And it has language that is legal and compliant that is alien to you, and the model’s doing something [on its own]. How do you know? That is actually the big difference. I guess I would be a little more reductive. I would describe the problem here as garbage in, garbage out, right? The promise of so much enterprise software, particularly HR finance software, is if you just had more information, you would get better decisions. If everyone would just fill out all of the fields, if only everybody would just fill out the software correctly, we would have better perfect real-time information about the business and then we would make better decisions. What AI is doing, maybe not built into Workday but just in general, is that now people with a ChatGPT app on their phone can definitely fill out all of the fields, 100 percent. You already see it in job applications. People are applying to a thousand times more jobs than they were before because they can just fire a copy into these job applications from ChatGPT, and now the systems are overwhelmed with irrelevant information. So you’ve got garbage in. What on Earth? Like, how do you solve this problem in the context of having to turn that into actionable information? Yeah, I think it’s two points. And I do want to go back quickly to what I would describe as the challenge of shallow enterprise IP before we get to what you just said about how we cope with the new behaviors that are emergent with the use of AI. I would actually challenge what you said. Models get it wrong a lot, specifically when you talk about something that is not in the public domain. So we have public knowledge, and models are extremely good at compressing this knowledge. They’re terrific. Who would’ve thought? I think everyone was surprised in 2022 when [chat bots] really broke through and how powerful the technology would become with actually a very simplistic mathematical model. That’s the mind-boggling insight. The math is simple. It’s just applied at volume and it produces these incredible results. But you now have these Ph.D.-level models coming into an enterprise context and showing up for the first day at work. They know nothing about the intricacies of an enterprise, the proprietary data. You spoke about a database. There is nothing represented in the knowledge base of that model. And yes, some of it is emergent, meaning that without really being trained with it, they are reasonably good at doing something with it. But the bigger point being is they get it wrong a lot. So one side, when you ask what Workday is doing, it’s actually taking these models and making them do something valuable in an enterprise context. Just something as simple and it connects to what you just spoke about, making sure you are selecting the right candidates for a job. That is a non-trivial task because you need to understand job requirements, behaviors, and job applications. You need to basically train and specialize a model — and not only a model, actually, a system and a set of models — to do that with high accuracy. Contracts are in many cases using language, terms, and have implications which again are not existing in a public domain. So you have to train a model to basically understand enterprise contracts and apply them in a system like Workday. So I think that’s big. Right now, I’m in San Francisco. We have autonomous cars driving around here. I think that’s an important insight, right? For something to be used in a mission-critical domain, it needs to work all the time. An autonomous car is not viable if it only works 99 percent. Would you use it? I wouldn’t use it. It needs to work 100 percent of the time. There’s a lot of Tesla owners out there who have made a different decision than you. I’m not even going there, right? I know a trick question when I hear it, so I’m not even going there. But for it to work it needs to work 100 percent of the time, and doing this in an enterprise context is heavy lifting. The second thing you said is that of course with AI, behavior changes in helpful and in unhelpful ways. I use AI a lot to do research, and it’s awesome because I have all of this intelligence on tap, and it’s also being used in unhelpful ways, like you’ve said, for creating content spam and unhelpful data signals, which overflow systems. The good thing, though, is that there is always a balance, right? There’s a constant balance between misuse, abuse, and protection. So what is the antidote to what you have just described? It’s that if bots generate applications or forge expense lines and try to trick the expense system, you use AI models to also counter that. As it turns out, AI models are terrific in spotting patterns that are generated versus done from a human. I’m sure you have filled out a CAPTCHA request online in your life, a couple, right? So the same idea. You basically build protection using AI to make sure you’re not being missed or abused by AI. I think that’s all the same meta theme of increasing maturity and using AI systems and working with AI actors both inside and outside of a company. I want to ask you Decoder questions and I want to try to put all this together. You’ve only been at Workday a few months. You probably know where the bathrooms are in the office, I’m hoping, by now. You’ve met all the people. What are you thinking about how your team, the product org, is structured and how you want to change it? That’s an interesting question because you’re actually kind of trying to lead a witness here. Like, “How do you imagine you would change that?” I’m not sure if I am. So Workday is a young company. Workday is 20 years old. Compare this with many other enterprise software companies that are twice as old or even older, right? So Workday has a really strong technology foundation. Actually, what surprised me the most when I got into Workday is how good its technology foundation is. I joined from a cloud provider. I worked at Google for the past four years before I joined Workday. So you come back to the enterprise application domain of certain anticipations and Workday really is incredible when it comes to its tech stack, its scalability, its elasticity. I mean, it was a cloud-first system from the get-go, so it really has a great foundation to stand on. When I think about evolving as going to the future, it pretty much aligns with what you have said. It’s maturing enterprise systems around the use of AI. My take is the following: Today you see a lot of bolt-on AI, meaning you see a lot of legacy systems and they just get an AI overlay, and you see integration vendors deal with all of this complexity, and now AI comes to the scene and they say, “Well, let’s just slap AI over it and we call it automation.” I just want to go back to autonomous cars. If you have AI, the opportunity is to purposefully build with AI to change how a job is done. Where we started actually gets completely innovated and revolutionized. For instance, when we think about something like job applications, something very natural, we all have an understanding. We all applied for jobs. I’m not sure if you did, actually, but I did in my life and I think it resonates. Wait, when you got the job at Workday, did you have to apply in Workday? No, I did not. It’s a good question. No, I did not actually. But Workday is not my first job, right? I was a [junior employee] once, and I put an application into a system and then through the interviewing process. The big opportunity that we have by really innovating in Workday is now taking agentic AI models and not just driving API automation of an old process that was defined by, if you will, human constraints to a new way of doing it with the heavy use of AI. For instance, tailored onboarding experiences, tailored experiences for job applicants and targeting who we approach and how are they feeling for that. You just said, “Why does it matter how I apply to a job, right? I just fill out a form.” But there are industries, for instance, where you have high numbers of frontline workers in retail and hospitality where you have thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of applicants a year, and for them actually signing up for a shift or basically joining a company is something that is either frictionless and you can do it through an intelligent experience — including your skill assessment on your mobile phone with a conversation — or you have to log on to a classical web application and fill out forms. I mean, which one would you use? I think there are real opportunities of how we can really change the way these processes are done from what it used to be, which is human- and document-driven, to proactive and AI-led. When you think about those opportunities and how your team is organized, how do you map those things together? How’s your team actually structured? How is Workday structured? We have an AI team today, which is, again, I think a testament to Workday being a young company and being very forward-leaning when it comes to AI. So there is a great AI organization that is part of my product organization, which is basically driving the Workday ML and AI platform. Many of the great things that we are doing in the recruiting space and the contract intelligence space like self-service and agent system of record, this is all being driven by that group. As I’ve indicated, this is one of the key innovation pillars that we have. We have our application domains, right? We have our office of the CHRO, office of finance, our industries, and those are application teams which are basically building on our technology foundation, the AI foundation, our application server, and building the systems that you and I and any listener on this podcast would recognize and say, “Oh that’s Workday,” right. That’s the UI and the workflows around it. And then there’s an infrastructure team, as you would imagine, which is basically running our deployments into the various cloud providers. I mean we are running on AWS and we are running on Google Cloud, and as you can imagine,, this is infrastructure and a pipeline that also needs to be built and maintained. Those in a nutshell are the groups: AI, our applications from HR, finance and industries, and our infrastructure team. Right before you joined, Workday had some big layoffs. I think 1,750 people were let go. Obviously those weren’t your decisions. As you came into the company, did you think, “Oh, I need to hire up,” or was one of the justifications for those cuts that you need to invest more in AI? Tell me about that balance. Did you see, “Okay, we need fewer engineers because the ones we have are using a bunch of AI tools,” or did you see, “We actually need to go hire a bunch of AI engineers?” You’re asking me a question about a time when I wasn’t at Workday, so I can’t really speak to the thinking that went into that decision. I can see, judging from the 60 days or almost 70 days now into my role, that we are actually investing in AI. We are investing across our application suite. I think in a bigger picture, like you have said, yes, the work of software engineering is changing with the use of AI and with the application of AI, meaning that we built skills inside of Workday to effectively use AI and we are hiring for people that bring that expertise into the company, so on both ends. I wouldn’t think, though, that this is in any way different or special from what the overall industry is doing. I mean, we’ve seen so many companies, including companies we have interviewed on the show like Duolingo, say, “Okay, we’re all in on AI. We’re through the testing and experimentation phase. The way we’re running this company is now formally changing because of AI and we expect AI to appear in all the things we do.” Are you all the way there? Yeah, we are making — I hope as any professional software company out there — heavy use of code assistance and wipe coding. And I’ve started my career in software engineering myself, but I was a hands-on developer for many years, and just seeing how much it helps and changes the quality and the results you drive on the software engineering side is amazing. With wipe coding, actually, I think what it drives on the product management side is amazing, that you can actually specify working prototypes and real interactions. It’s not just Figma anymore or a [Product Requirements Document], which is great, right? Because you give so much more fidelity to your ideas. So yes, we make heavy use of that and I truly believe it delivers real returns. Foremost because when I was a developer, I made a fair amount of bugs, meaning introducing issues in the programs that you’ve written. I hope that every software developer out there has the same moral integrity to say, “Bugs happen.” What I saw, and what convinced me the most about assisted coding, is that actually, most of the bugs that you create are in hindsight like, “Yeah, I should have really got that. I just didn’t think the following conditions through.” AI helps in two ways. One is it’s so good at test-case generation that you just have way better verification. And secondly, the assisted coding generates high-quality code, really not making many of the typical mistakes and anti-patterns that you just make as you’re developing from a junior to a very senior software engineer. So we use all of that. That’s super exciting. And yes, Workday has a very powerful concept. It’s called Everyday AI. It was the second thing that surprised me about Workday. And man, Nilay, you’re asking me these questions. I’m not trying to make an advertisement for Workday here, but you’re just asking for it. Workday has this program, Everyday AI, and then when I joined the company, we were having an offsite just in week two, and it was basically a review of Everyday AI, and I was so amazed about how broadly Workday is applying AI. I have talked to so many companies in my past that came to me in my previous role and said, “Well, how do we use AI? What are the use cases? What works?” Then I came to Workday, ranging from employee self-service to contract intelligence in legal, basically both front and back office are making heavy use of AI models, AI applications, and AI systems. I think it was a very smart decision of the company to say, “Let’s experiment very broadly in every function. Let’s find what really delivers value and then quickly double down on those scenarios.” And so I think that Workday is incredibly mature when it comes to applying AI for itself. The other big Decoder question I ask everybody is how do you make decisions? What’s your framework? My framework to make decisions? I believe in understanding the details. I think you can ask the question in another way: why do decisions go wrong in the first place? First of all, I think you have to recognize that there is a certain element of uncertainty in every decision that anyone makes. Meaning you can make a really good decision and you can have a bad outcome and you can make a horrible decision and you just get lucky. And that’s the nature of the uncertainty, if you will, of the future, depending on what your belief system is. But I think it’s hard to predict the future and there is always an element of chance and probability. So I think that’s something we have to recognize about it, and that tells us something. That tells us that the one thing I can influence in decision-making actually is having a really robust process that on average, if you will, or in a great end count, produces significantly more good outcomes than bad outcomes. So I’m basically trying to address the uncertainty by having a very robust framework and process to get to a high-quality decision process because I know that statistically that will drive to high-quality decisions in outcome, but you can’t make all of them right. My decision process follows, I think, a simple framework. One is trying to mitigate, as much as possible, human bias. We all have them. They’re so human. It’s funny that I say it that way. There’s so much ingrained in our nature. There is this great book I think by Daniel Kahneman, Thinking, Fast and Slow, I’m sure you’ve come across it — that talks about all of the biases that we have and how our brain functions, and there are just some typical repeat patterns. For instance, that we have loss aversion. We think about losses more significantly than potential wins. If I give you $10 and if I then take it away again, you’re not at the same level of happiness as you were. You are unhappy. I made you unhappy, right? Even though you’re exactly the same as when you started, it’s just the loss feels heavier and it biases decision-making. There is a bias in preferences, right? There’s so many things that you can address by, one, having a very structured a decision-making process, going through all of the alternatives, listing them out, writing them down, actually being explicit about them and thinking with pen and paper, if you will, because it helps you to bust all of these biases that you have. And then second of all, in the decision-making process, actually engaging the right set of people to come to an unbiased decision itself, with the right balance of expertise. And thirdly, I think understanding the details matter. The abstractions are helpful, yes, and there is a certain element where it is not adding value anymore to go even deeper. We would all agree you don’t need to understand quantum mechanics to know how to throw a ball, that there are helpful abstractions. But in decision-making on leadership and on businesses, you really do want to go to the right level of detail to truly understand the dynamics of what’s going on. And then there’s being time-bound, right? My father has this great saying that is with me a lot, and he says, “You need to have the courage to take the second-best solution.” And what he means with that is that the most and fiercest competitor that we have in life is status quo. Most of the time we are not taking a decision one way or another. Most of the time we simply decide to not decide and analyze more. Let’s find even more data. Let’s kick the can down the road because you are of the idea that if you just give it more time, you will come to a better solution. And the problem with that is that you are actually passing the point where progress is more important than one percent more accuracy in the decision that you take. So if you put those four things together, having a really good decision framework that goes against or insulates you from your own biases. Secondly, having the right mixture of experts around you to make sure you are really having the key voices representative. Thirdly, understanding the details so you can make an informed decision, and then when the clock runs out, you go. You need to have the courage for the second-best solution sometimes. Let’s put this into practice. Workday, like all enterprise software, suffers from a disconnect between the customer and the user. You see this in every enterprise. Every piece of enterprise software has this problem. It’s CIOs and CEOs and COOs who buy this stuff and there are employees who use it, and that means there’s not a great feedback loop between the experiences of the people using the software and the people who are spending money on it, and that means the software is all bad. Like, broadly. We don’t use Workday here, we use UKG Pro. I think UKG Pro is bad. I’ll just name all your competitors down the line. The users think the software is bad. Workday has a particular reputation here. Business Insider literally published a piece in 2024 called “Everyone hates Workday” and the quotes are brutal. Here’s one from an AI company, a copy director at an AI company. The quote is, “Using Workday is like constantly being botsmacked by bureaucracy incarnate. Getting somebody onboarded, using Workday is like trying to get water from your sink to your stove using a colander.” That’s bad. Using a what? Using a colander, like a strainer. Okay. You’re trying to carry water with a bucket with holes in it. You see this everywhere. The interface as expressed is bad. People do not like using the software. There’s another quote from that same piece: “Everything is so non-intuitive. Even the simplest tasks leave me scratching my head.” There’s one that says, “I just hate the software.” Great. That’s every piece of enterprise software. But Workday in particular has this headline, this reputation. You can see it on Reddit. You can see it in the comments of the training videos I was watching on YouTube. How do you fix that problem? I think a part of that is really understanding what you just articulated. As I said, understand the details, right? Understand, truly, the details to make sure you are making good decisions specifically about what you invest time in and what you think generates value for the users of Workday? So when we say, “Understand the details,” I think it’s really important in enterprise software to go through the workflows in detail and sometimes for yourself, sometimes by observation, sometimes by interview, and really have firsthand experience about what it is that people do and how does it feel and what makes it good and what can be improved upon it. I think to your point, it sounds so benign, but you said let’s apply this framework, right? The framework simply states that, “Well, do you understand the problem really when someone is saying this is great or someone is saying this is bad? What do they truly mean?” Because we all have our biases, right? For instance, one big bias is you seek validation, right? You seek validation for what you believe to be true, and you overemphasize on signals that reinforce that. The first step is really going to the right level of detail and understanding what it is at the action level that drives satisfaction or dissatisfaction in a piece of your application experience. Once you have that, once you understand that, it turns out that usually the framework becomes almost obvious to say, “Well, this is something that ideally should be different,” or, “This is something that actually works the way it’s supposed to.” It’s just not communicated. It’s miscommunicated, right? You are holding it wrong. That’s quite a quote. Yeah, that category exists, believe it or not. Or thirdly, “Hey, actually we have different ways or different expectations now of how you can use that.” For instance, when you talk about system interactions, right, the reality is that it’s a dynamic environment. I have two kids. They have different expectations of using a system than what I had. I grew up with forms, that was computer stuff, right? How cool is that? That’s amazing. My daughter is mobile-first and, dare I say now, AI-first, and she’s just eight years old. So that’s the amazing part of it, a different intuition. So when I say Workday and AI specifically, it’s now, “Hey, how can we make this conversational?“ or, “How can we make it so you don’t even have to specify some of this information anymore?” Like you said, I have to take information from here to there. Why is this complex? Why do you even have to? Is an AI model maybe proficient, and can we make it proficient so it just automates that? This is why I wanted to start with talking about what the software actually is. When I see a quote that says, “This software is bureaucracy incarnate,” what I imagine that means is a bunch of people at a company had a bunch of priorities and they all got expressed in a form. Everybody wants another piece of data from whatever process is happening and we’re just going to put another field in the form and then everyone can get their data, and that’s your “bureaucracy incarnate,” right? We’re literally shipping the org chart in the nature of this process. Okay, so now we’re going to say AI is going to fix it. We’re going to fill in all the forms as fast as possible just by talking, and all the forms get filled out, and then that looks like a risk. Like there you have exactly the risk. Maybe the AI is just going to say 20 percent nicer things because the model’s wrong because ChatGPT 4.0 got a little too nice one day. Maybe it’s just going to make some stuff up because it thinks that’s what you want to hear. Maybe it’s going to mishear the person. I hear a lot from a lot of companies that AI is the new user interface, all the way down to Eddy Cue on the stand in the Google trial yesterday, who said maybe 10 years from now you won’t even have an iPhone because AI will have replaced it all. That’s where we are as an industry. And then I look at this very simple problem for a lot of people filling out a database on Workday. Filling out the database for the AI might mean the database is full of bad information, but no one else has solved the problem in any other way. I think it really connects to where we started, the whole question of what drives value with AI. I fundamentally believe with AI, as with any other technology, you can apply it superficially or you can apply it in an excellent way. And applying AI in an excellent way actually means getting AI to differentiated levels of accuracy and outcomes. We talked about autonomous cars and you said some work and some don’t, right? So there’s clearly a difference, right? Even though you could all say, “Well, I’m sure they make all use of AI somewhere somehow to do processing and trajectory projection and so forth.” And that’s exactly what we are focusing on with Workday, because some of the information, like you have said, is important information, right? Guess what? You want to pay people. You want to have internal mobility. We have, in companies, in many companies today, a shortage of qualified labor for the work that they want to get done, and they have people sometimes inside the company who could do it or even people outside of the company that they could activate for doing it, just to pick a very simple example. And now the question is, what can you do by excellently applying AI to really revolutionize and improve these journeys? And there are clearly ways to do that. I was just speaking about recruiting, but you can help recruiters make better decisions. They don’t have to fill in the form anymore. They don’t have to make the assessment. The model helps them to identify the right candidate for the greater good of everyone. Well, let me ask you about that. You inherit literally the biases of the models, right? You inherit literally the capabilities of the model. Right now there’s a lawsuit against Workday saying that the tools are biased against workers and applicants, particularly Black workers and applicants over the age of 40. That might be the problem in the model, that might be the problem in how you’ve expressed the model, it might just be how people are using the model. But now you’re saying you’re going to help make these decisions and you have this liability. How do you fix that? First of all, I cannot possibly comment on any ongoing lawsuit, but in general– But the lawsuit exists, right? You know it exists. This is the problem in depending on the AI. The AI might make errors of this magnitude. I will give you Gerrit’s opinion. So because again, and you know this, if you want to have commentary on the ongoing case, you have to talk to the right person for it. That’s not who I am. But I can speak to you in general about AI. I think AI actually helps us to become unbiased, and the same principle applies, right? You can apply AI very poorly, and it’s a question of maturity. Since the course of the existence of machine learning, people learn that if you have the wrong training data and you’re lacking guardrails, the model just expresses what was given [to] the model during its training phase. Basically, you define it by the act of creating it. And as you move from immature AI to excellent AI, when we understand the representation of data, the guardrails that we have to put around it, I think all of these biases, as you described — that humans are susceptible too, just in a different way. But humans have emotions, humans have irrational elements to them. We are not computers. And that is what makes humans great, but it also makes us, in many cases, poor decision-makers. But the AIs… the corpus of their training material is biased human information. Yeah, exactly. How do you take that and then turn that into a thing that unbiases us? Especially in these contexts. I mean, Amazon had to stop using AI screening tools that were imposing bias into their hiring process. Can you measure it? Can you say, “Okay, we’re good enough”? You do it by getting the recipe right, meaning you’re getting the training recipe right, you’re getting the guardrails right, and I think this is the important intersectionally that in order to get AI right, you have to look at it holistically. You have to understand the domain. You have to understand what is the judgment that a model applies. You have to understand what training data you need to provide for it, and you need to provide the guardrails that you have to basically put as checks and balances around it so it stays in its defined parameters. Once you do that — and that’s the power of AI and machine learning models — they will consistently work at the same level of quality, but it’s the responsibility to create that system around it. I think — again, my opinion — if you do that, it works in an incredibly powerful way. Let’s just go back to something we all experience in San Francisco every day: autonomous cars. That’s a great example, because so many things can go wrong, and now we are at the stage where they work reliably. And the lesson is, if you design a system the right way, if you think about it holistically, you can actually make it work all the time, better than a human driver would, because we also have human limitations that we don’t want passed on. What is every good recruiting team doing? What is every good performance review team doing at the beginning of a review session? Let’s unbias ourselves, right? Let’s talk about them so we free ourselves from that being applied. And there are teams that are good at it. There are teams that are not as good at it. But if you codify it in a system, you can basically have the best-possible decision-making on tap every day, and that’s the power of it. Tekedra Mawakana, the CEO of Waymo, has been on the show, and the thing that struck me was that it’s true, it does work great in San Francisco, I think in Austin and Phoenix now, too. It’s rolling out. All warm weather cities. I asked her, “Will this thing work in Denver?” And she was like, “No, no, no, no, no. Too hilly. Too snowy. Can’t do it.” That’s what I mean. We’ve designed systems in very narrow domains under essentially perfect conditions that we trust, and then you make it more complex and then it’s just like no, we can’t do it yet. Maybe we’ll get there one day, but we can’t do it yet. I think you’re completely right, and that’s exactly what I mean. You make it work by narrowing the domain. It’s incredibly hard to make a car work everywhere. It’s incredibly difficult to make a general AI that works on everything. And again, that’s the Workday recipe. Our claim is not that we are going to make an artificial general intelligence that solves any problem. We do exactly what you said. It’s narrowing down the domain to something that we really understand, that we understand perfectly, and let’s design a system that basically solves that part of the enterprise ecosystem. When you think about the complaints people have for Workday today, I want to ask you two different questions. One, what are the top five ones that you want to fix? People do not like using this software. How would you fix it for them today? That seems to be a really important point for you, Nilay. As I said, you were brave. This is why enterprise executives don’t come on the show, because that’s honestly what the listeners want me to ask. How are you going to fix my problems today? It’s not just feature requests, it’s the holistic experience of using enterprise software that is bad. How would you fix it today? I think my conviction… down to the bones of my body if you will, I’m a product person. I love well-designed products and I seek them out for myself and I aspire to build them. I think when we say about building a product — and I was talking earlier like, are you holding it the right way? — beautiful design is how it works. It’s not just how it looks. Design is how it works in everyday use, from a coffee machine to an enterprise software system, and I think the recipe is for all of them the same. Recognizing that this is a big deal. This is not something that just falls off at the end. That’s something you have to carefully research, design, and invest for to make it work. And then secondly, when you asked me about my decision-making process, really understanding those details, what works well and what doesn’t. If something doesn’t work well, what’s the best way to improve it and to make a tangible improvement for the ones who are articulating the need for improvement. I believe honestly in a relentless pursuit of the basics. When we say excellence, how do you get excellence in anything? I think it’s to recognize the importance every day. Secondly, apply the discipline rigorously every morning, every afternoon before you go to bed. And if you do this consistently enough over a period of time, you will see huge differences. The problem with all of these things is you cannot go from here to there in a step function, change from here to tomorrow, right? Because actually what you’re saying is, “How do you achieve excellence in something which is non-trivial?” And as I said, first of all, it’s fully believing in its value, otherwise you won’t have the strength to see it through, and then secondly, applying the basics of that discipline every single day, rigorously, and over a period of time, and you will see amazing returns. I said I was going to ask this question two ways, so here’s the second way. Do you use Workday at Workday? Yes, we’re using Workday at Workday. What are the five things that bother you most about using Workday at your job? Can I tell you what the biggest surprise was, first of all, when I came to Workday? I have used Workday before. Sure. [Laughs] The Workday at Workday looks so different. [Laughs] I mean, this is one of the issues, right, because your customers deploy it differently. Exactly. And I was coming into Workday and I said, “I’m surprised,” because the system that I have just used for everything, from entire onboarding, from benefits enrollment, to corporate credit card, to learning my team, to any sort of approvals, to org review, I’ve done it all in Workday. Everything, and it is so different. And so I said “Explain this to me.” Because honestly, in my previous Workday experience, I had struggled with a couple of things here. This is different. And I was told basically what you said: “Yeah, it’s a real issue that we have customers who configure and deploy the system and are not updating the system to any of the improvements we have done over the recent past.” So when you asked what I wanted to change immediately? I want to go on a campaign and actually make sure that the quality of the experience — and I’m not saying there is nothing to be improved anymore — but the many, many things that I have experienced firsthand myself are 10 times better from what I personally have seen before. Making sure that all of this flows for the users. What are some of those things? Be specific. Search. Find me my form for requesting a credit card, searching “credit card,” and getting the form loaded and populated with the right fields already, because, guess what, you know my name, right? There is no surprise here. And my employee ID and all of that. And just making me basically select the credit card example, what is the limit, and if I want express delivery and send. Something like that. So search experience, one terrific example, or the assistant experience, one of the workflows that people most do commonly is request personal time off. In Workday Everywhere, you can do this by using Slack or Teams, right, with a chatbot. So I bet many of the things that you were quoting are people trying to do something that to them looks very simplistic: “I just want to know my PTO balance and put in a request. Why do we even have to log on to that system?” So that’s what I mean when I talk about a difference in expectations, that you just expect it to happen in your collaboration suite. Well, with Workday Everywhere, that works and I was surprised. Before you ask, I didn’t request PTO in my first 60 days, but I was trying it out, okay, because I wanted to know, because I believe in understanding the details. So as said, one of the things I want to do first is making sure all of this flows through to everyone because I think there is so much goodness that people are not yet getting. You’re hinting at something here, and this’ll be the last question because it’s just a big idea that I keep coming back to in all these conversations about AI and software and how we use it, that eventually the interface will just be natural language, right? There’s the small step you’re talking about, which is to go to the customers and help them deploy Workday more beautifully and make it make more sense for people and use all the tools. And then there’s the big one, which is you’re just going to talk to it and it’s going to do some stuff. How far away do you think we are from that? I think there are a whole lot of tasks where people use forms to approximate conversations where conversation is clearly a better paradigm, like a self-service type of request. Like I said, PTO and PTO balance. This is more like a self-service scenario where I can easily specify and it’s automating that and conversation is a good way of exposing it. And there are some others that fall in the same category, but turns out there are many that are not. So like I said, how many things can you remember in a conversation, off top of your head? Probably seven concepts max at a time. There are some application domains where you have a way more complex context and state models right there. Just something as simplistically as could you design a 3D scene without seeing it just through conversation? Of course not. Would you want to specify verbally that you want to select an element in the fourth layer? Probably not, right? It’s way too complex. Pointing and clicking is way more efficient. So I argue the case that conversational models will be a key part of what everyday experience is for a certain set of problems that just very nicely fit into it, and there is a larger set of problems, they are the state model, and the contexts are so dense that you cannot possibly conceive them in a conversational thread because it’s just overlaying what you can memorize in your brain. So I think it’s going to be on both ends, but I think every scenario where you’re going to ask something — “Can you do this for me? Can you find that information for me?” — it’s more simplistic in terms of the information retrieval, which is a great example of that, by the way. I think that’s going to be completely replaced with a conversational interface because why not? Essentially you have a request-response paradigm with some refinement in the middle for which a conversation turns out to be the best way of facilitating that. One of the reasons I asked this question is because my favorite Slack room at our company is called “finance-support,” and it’s staffed mostly by bots, and the people who are new to it come in and they ask very nice questions in full sentences, and the people who use it every day just shout nouns into the void. I’m looking at it right now — it just says, there’s someone who just says, “Extra April expenses.” One person literally just typed the word “credit card,” and then entered into an entire flow with this bot. It’s basically a command line and we’ve just recapitulated the command line with a more conversational interface where people have realized that the keywords will just do the job. Is that where we’re headed? We’re just doing command line? I don’t think so, but I do think what you’re describing actually is a good thing. I heard that OpenAI is using a lot of inference cycles because people are just being polite to the model, saying “thank you” and “please.” But the model’s going to work for that. So what you’re describing I think is just an amazing efficiency that people understand, “Hey, I don’t have to write a fully specified sentence of punctuation. I can just keyword it in and the system is going to do it for me.” And I think it’s because for some of the work this is just very efficient. Like are you really typing a full URL in your browser and writing it full out? I don’t. I rely on autocomplete and search to do the job for me. That’s a perfectly fine way of accomplishing the job. But I do think, like I’ve said, there are a certain set of problems like information retrieval and simple workflows where this is just a very nice way of doing it. That command line is good for a reason, to your point. An intelligent command line is very powerful. But there’s a bigger set of tasks and jobs where you wouldn’t use a command line. You need to see what you’re dealing with. You have many elements that are in relationship with each other. Just take something as simplistic as a contract in finance, because you just said finance, and you have a context with multiple payment terms that are dependent on each other. So you do need to see those pieces and how they interact with each other to make sense out of them. And AI is going to help you in identifying them and telling you, “This is a red line in a contract that you have to pay attention to. This is a payment term that you may want to leverage.” But if you want to modify that contract, if you want to rearrange it, you want to see the piece that you’re working with, right? You have this across so many domains that I think AI is going to change UI, and we have UIs that are designed with AI in mind. Today, some vendors are telling you you’re going to have a chatbot and a workflow engine and that’s going to be great, and that’s a good story to tell because we have all of this stuff built and having a chatbot over it doesn’t hurt, for sure, but it’s not going to change how you run as a company. It’s not going to be a transformative outcome for you. But if you design applications with AI collaboration in mind from the get-go — payroll, benefit selection, if you want to elect your benefits, you may want to see options. You may want to have multiple options compared to each other. There are going to be things where we can decide whether we’re going to render UIs into chatbots or render AI next to UIs, but it’s not going to lose those elements of interactivity where you just need to break beyond textual input and output. Gerrit, I feel like we could talk about the future of AI and how it changes workplace interface forever. I have to say, by the way, thank you.

Title: ‘Motivated accusations’: MakeMyTrip fires back at EaseMyTrip founder’s allegation over ‘Chinese links’ & ‘defence data’
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/motivated-accusations-makemytrip-fires-back-at-easemytrip-founder-s-allegation-over-chinese-links-and-defence-data-11747306893118.html
Time Published: 2025-05-15T15:06:22Z

Nishant Pitti, chairman and founder of travel aggregator EaseMyTrip, has alleged that one of his rival companies MakeMyTrip, has a loophole on their website. Pitti claimed that the company, which is ‘majorly owned by China’, compromises the data safety of Indian armed forces who use the platform to book tickets. In an X post on Wednesday, Pitti claimed that Indian Armed Forces personnel who book tickets via this platform using their defence IDs - inadvertently disclose their route and destination to China - since the platform is ‘majorly owned by China’. “Indian Armed Forces book discounted tickets via a platform majorly owned by China, entering Defence ID, route & date. Our enemies know where our soldiers are flying. Attaching screenshots exposing this loophole - it must be patched now,” he said. While Pitti did not name the platform in his post initially, the screenshots and one of his follow-up posts in the comment box suggest that the company in question was indeed MakeMyTrip. According to Pitti's post, Trip.com Group Limited (previously Ctrip.com International Limited) holds a ‘majority’ stake in MakeMyTrip. The company had acquired a stake in the company in September 2019. The post further claims that Vangard Group Inc. holds a 12.43 per cent stake in the company, while BlackRock Inc. has a 10.85 per cent stake. Fidelity Management and Research has a 7.82 per cent stake, Morgan Stanley has 6.37 per cent stake. Other institutional investors hold 22.53 per cent shares of the company, while public companies and individuals have 44.6 per cent stake. MakeMyTrip, a Nasdaq listed company, has 331 institutional holders who own over 7.6 crore shares in the company, according to the Nasdaq website. Mirae Asset Global Investments Co., Ltd., Baillie Gifford & Co, FMR LLC, GQG Partners LLC and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are the top five institutional investors with MakeMyTrip shares. When LiveMint reached out to MakeMyTrip regarding Pitti's allegations, a spokesperson said that the company is solely Indian with a diverse shareholder base around the globe. “MakeMyTrip is a proud Indian company, founded by Indians, headquartered in India, and trusted by millions of Indian travellers for over 25 years. We are a publicly listed company on the Nasdaq, with a diverse shareholder base spanning the globe," said a MakeMyTrip spokesperson. The company further said that its operations are independent and refused to comment on the accusations. “Our operations are independent, steered by a seasoned team of Indian professionals who bring a wealth of expertise and a commitment to excellence. We adhere to stringent corporate governance standards, fully complying with all applicable Indian laws and data privacy frameworks.” “We don’t comment on malicious or motivated accusations and remain focused on offering our best services to our customers as a responsible Indian corporate.” Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Crypto for Advisors: Stablecoins Explained

Thank you to our sponsor of this week's newsletter, Grayscale. For financial advisors near Chicago, Grayscale is hosting an exclusive event, Crypto Connect, on Thursday, May 22. Learn more. – Sarah Morton When major financial institutions — from Citi and Standard Chartered to Brevan Howard, McKinsey and BCG — rally around a once-niche innovation, it’s a good idea to take note, especially when the innovation is stablecoins, a tokenized representation of money on-chain. What email was to the internet, stablecoin is to blockchain — instant and cost-effective value transfer at a global scale running 24/7. Stablecoin is blockchain’s first killer use case. First introduced by Tether in 2015 and hailed as the first stablecoin, USDT offered early crypto users a way to hold and transfer a stable, dollar-denominated value on-chain. Until then, their only alternative was bitcoin. Tether’s dollar-backed stablecoin made its debut on Bitfinex before rapidly spreading to major exchanges like Binance and OKX. It quickly became the default trading pair across the digital asset ecosystem. As adoption grew, so did its utility. No longer just a trading tool, stablecoin emerged as the primary cash-equivalent for trading, cash management, and payments. Below is the trajectory of stablecoin’s market size since inception, a reflection of its evolution from a crypto niche to a core pillar of digital finance. The reason stablecoins have been a hot topic in finance is their rapid adoption and growth. According to Visa, stablecoin on-chain transaction volume exceeded $5.5 trillion in 2024. By comparison, Visa’s volume was $13.2 trillion while Mastercard transacted $9.7 trillion during the same period. Why such proliferation? Because stable dollar-denominated cash is the lifeblood for the entire digital assets ecosystem. Here are 3 major use cases for stablecoin. 1. Digital Assets Trading Given its origins, it's no surprise that trading was stablecoin’s first major use case. What began as a niche tool for value preservation in 2015 is now the beating heart of digital asset trading. Today, stablecoins underpin over $30 trillion in annual trading volume across centralized exchanges, powering the vast majority of spot and derivatives activity. But stablecoin’s impact doesn’t end with centralized exchanges — It is also the liquidity backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi). Onchain traders need the same reliable cash equivalent for moving in and out of positions. A glance at leading decentralized platforms, such as Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and Hyperliquid, shows that top trading pairs are consistently denominated by stablecoins. Monthly decentralized exchange volumes routinely hit $100-200 billion, according to The Block, further cementing stablecoin’s role as the foundational layer of the modern digital assets market. 2. Real World Assets Real-world assets (RWAs) are tokenized versions of traditional instruments such as bonds and equities. Once a fringe idea, RWAs are now among the fastest-growing asset classes in crypto. Leading this wave is the tokenized U.S. Treasury market, now boasting over $6 billion AUM. Launched in early 2023, these on-chain Treasuries opened the door for crypto-native capital to access the low-risk, short-duration US T-Bills yield. The adoption saw a staggering 6,000% growth according to RWA.xyz: from just $100 million in early 2023 to over $6 billion AUM today. Asset management heavyweights such as BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Fidelity (pending SEC approval) are all creating on-chain treasury products for digital capital markets. Unlike traditional Treasuries, these digital versions offer 24/7 instant mint/redemptions, and seamless composability with other DeFi yield opportunities. Investors can subscribe and redeem around the clock, with stablecoin liquidity delivered in real time. Circle’s facility with BlackRock’s BUIDL and PayPal’s integration with Ondo’s OUSG are just two prominent examples. 3. Payment A major emerging use case for stablecoins is cross-border payment, especially in corridors underserved by traditional financial infrastructure. In much of the world, international payments remain slow, expensive, and error-prone due to dependency on correspondent banking. By contrast, stablecoins offer merchants and consumers an alternative with its instant, low-cost, always-on transfers. According to research from a16z, stablecoin payments are 99.99% cheaper and 99.99% faster than traditional wire transfers and they settle 24/7. The shift is gaining momentum in the West, too. Stripe’s $1 billion acquisition of Bridge and subsequent introduction of Stablecoin Financial Account signal the start of mainstream global adoption. Meanwhile, PayPal’s rollout of yield on PYUSD balances highlights stablecoin’s rise as a legitimate retail payment vertical. What was once a crypto-native solution is fast becoming a global financial utility. - Harvey Li, founder, Tokenization Insight Q. In light of the recent news from Europe regarding stablecoins and Tether, can you explain how stablecoin investment is valuable to an individual? A. In the inherently volatile and highly risky world of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins provide individuals with a capital-efficient way to gain exposure to digital assets. Pegged to fiat currencies like the euro or commodities like gold, these digital assets provide stability and a hedge against crypto’s volatility. Crypto individuals can park their funds safely in stablecoins during times of uncertainty without having to exit the market and deal with TradFi. This is why stablecoins dominate crypto. Their combined market cap has surpassed $245bln, a massive 15x growth over the last five years. Q. Given current market trends in Europe, are stablecoins more or less susceptible to market fluctuations? A. While stablecoins are inherently less volatile than typical crypto assets, they remain sensitive to regulatory developments and issuer credibility. When it comes to Europe, specifically, stablecoins have become less susceptible to market fluctuations due to stringent regulatory measures. This includes the implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which provides a clear legal framework that requires stablecoin issuers to maintain adequate reserves and comply with strict governance standards. Such rules reduce the risk of de-pegging and enhance overall stability. However, this leads to market consolidation, a lack of competition, and reduced innovation at the same time. Q. Is Europe becoming a new stablecoin hub as it becomes more receptive to crypto? A. Europe has been signalling a friendly approach to crypto through MiCA, the first comprehensive crypto framework globally that introduces licensing requirements for digital asset service providers and AML protocols. The aim is to create a structured and harmonized regulatory environment for the crypto market, protect customers, and ensure financial stability. Through its evolving MiCA regulations, Europe could certainly enhance institutional confidence and attract more stablecoin issuers. However, that would require overcoming licensing (a lengthy and costly process) issues, effective implementation at national levels, and adapting to the fast-progressing crypto space. Europe is currently not a global leader in stablecoin adoption, but with clearer rules coming into place and its openness to compliant entities, it is well-positioned to emerge as a key hub for compliant stablecoin innovation. - Trevor Koverko, co-founder, Sapien Harvey Li writes about the business of tokenization and help teams navigate the roadblocks that stall adoption. As the founder of Tokenization Insight, the premier tokenization intelligence & GTM platform for institutions, he has a simple conviction: tokenization will transform global markets but only with the right products, distribution strategies, and communication frameworks in place. He work with leading tokenization teams to position them top-of-mind with key institutional stakeholders and support emerging startups in crafting and executing go-to-market strategies. Clients he's supported include Ondo Finance ($1B+ AUM), Ownera (interoperability partner to DTCC and JPMorgan) and Provenance Blockchain. About Contact

Title: Media CEO Pay Packages in 2024: The Air Up There
URL: https://variety.com/lists/media-ceo-salaries-compensation-pay-packages-2024/
Time Published: 2025-05-15T14:00:00Z

Top execs kept raking in the bucks last year, even as many of the companies they led struggled to stay aloft The entertainment business has seen better days. Film and TV production in the U.S. rose 18% last year but lagged 2022 levels, according to ProPro, which tracks studio productions. Theatrical ticket sales fell 3.3% in 2024 and remain nearly 25% down from pre-pandemic levels. Media conglomerates are spinning off cable channels at a dizzying rate, an acknowledgment of the damage that streaming has done to that cash cow. And tech giants like Amazon and Apple, which elbowed into the content business a few years ago, have found that it’s much harder to make a show that people care about than it is to sell them paper towels and iPhones. Cutbacks and layoffs are the order of the day. Yet for some reason the spirit of economizing didn’t extend to the executive suites. Seven of the 10 CEOs and media barons whose pay packages we examine as part of our annual survey of compensation got raises. And in most cases, the bumps were double-digit ones even though their results were often lackluster at best. “When the stock is up, CEOs always take credit, but when it plunges, they rarely take responsibility,” says Charles Elson of the University of Delaware’s John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance. “There should be more alignment between pay packages and performance so when there’s a bad year, the CEOs take more of a hit.” To be fair, some of these executives will end up banking far less than what’s reported. That’s because the stock awards and options represent fair value as of the grant date and do not reflect actual dollar amounts received by executives. If the company’s value shrinks, so does their compensation. Of course, if it increases, their windfall could be even greater than it initially appeared in public filings. The pay packages may be largely undiminished, but our list of top executives shrank. Paramount Global hoped to have finalized its sale to Skydance Media by now, but the Trump administration and the president’s lawsuit against “60 Minutes” appears to be holding up regulatory approval. Still, Bob Bakish, who left Paramount amid the company’s deal talks with Skydance, has already profited handsomely, earning $87 million last year, which includes $69.3 million in severance. Then there’s Endeavor, which went private again after four years as a publicly traded company. Ari Emanuel, the brash agent who led the company’s whipsaw transformation, got a $173.8 million cash payout from the equity he converted to cash as part of the go-private deal (while also rolling his ownership interests with a total value of $290.3 million into the newly private company, Endeavor Group Holdings). Paramount Global will likely soon have company, as most industry observers expect that other media companies are looking for buyers (speculation often centers on Warner Bros. Discovery, which has endured two traumatic mergers over the past seven years and formally separated its TV business from its studio and streaming operations). Experts like Elson say companies often have good reasons for selling themselves or acquiring each other. But he also notes that there’s often a strong financial incentive for the people at the top to make these kinds of deals. “The synergies that come with a merger can be quite helpful, but you have to make sure the cost savings are really there,” he says. “Sometimes these deals are more ego driven and turn out to be disasters.” Historically, media chieftains are far better compensated than leaders in other industries. Much of that has to do with the ownership structure of entertainment conglomerates such as Comcast and Fox, which have dual-class stock. That gives the families behind them much tighter control, enabling them to reward themselves without risking much interference from average shareholders. This, in turn, skews the pay packages of media companies like Disney and Netflix, which aren’t run by families but justify rewarding their executives with big bonuses and options because they are part of the same peer group. It helps that the boards of these companies are often loaded with sympathetic allies. “Board members themselves are well paid,” says Rosanna Landis Weaver of shareholder advocacy group As You Sow. “It’s a very cushy gig. And no board member ever got asked to leave for saying, ‘Let’s pay the CEO more.’” Running a media company requires a very particular set of skills. A successful CEO must be the public face of a corporation — telegenic, amiable, able to work a room — and also serve as an ambassador to Wall Street at a time when investors have grown more skeptical about the long-term health of the entertainment business. Just look how difficult it was for Bob Chapek, the short-lived CEO of Disney, whose tenure was so rocky that the company reenlisted Bob Iger, the man he succeeded, as his replacement. But if media conglomerates rationalize giving their leaders extravagant pay packages because they’re worried that another company is going to poach them or that they will leave of their own volition, they should probably think again. “The thing about the media business is that these jobs are fun,” says David L. Yermack, professor of finance at NYU. “You get to have a lot of influence on society, and shaping culture is interesting work. Running a coal mine or being in the utilities business isn’t anywhere near as interesting.” Bob Iger, CEO2024 compensation: $41.4M/+31%Median employee compensation: $55,111Iger pay ratio to median employee: 746 How do you determine a job well done? When it came to Iger’s $7.2 million bonus, Disney’s board gave him credit for releasing “Deadpool & Wolverine,” which the family-friendly brand enthused was “the highest grossing R-rated film ever,” as well as for presiding over the best-attended D23 event in history and leading a company dubbed one of America’s most trusted by no less an authority than Newsweek. It’s hardly an empirical assessment, but Iger did have a successful 2024, one that saw the studio topping its rivals at the box office and releasing streaming hits like “Shōgun.” For Iger’s efforts, his relatively modest $1 million salary got augmented by more than $30 million in stock options and awards, as well as $523,685 in personal air travel and $1.4 million in security. It pays to rule the Magic Kingdom. Ted Sarandos, Co-CEO2024 compensation: $61.9M/+24.3% Greg Peters, Co-CEO2024 compensation: $60.3M/+50.2% Median employee compensation: $215,503Sarandos/Peters pay ratio to median employee: 287/280 Bingeing has been very good to Netflix’s co-leaders. Last year, the company targeted $40 million in total compensation apiece. Both got more than 50% of that, thanks to the streamer’s stellar performance. The company ended 2024 with 301.6 million subscribers (up 16%) and generated operating income of more than $10 billion. The stock soared 89% for the year, dispelling any doubts about the unusual two-in-a-box leadership structure. For 2024, Sarandos and Peters each received a $12 million cash bonus plus stock valued at $42.7 million, with Netflix’s compensation committee citing “our outstanding relative stock price performance compared to constituents of the S&P 500.” Meanwhile, co-founder and chairman Reed Hastings’ pay package dropped to $1.75 million last year (from $11.3 million in 2023). Don’t pass the hat for Hastings — he owned 4.23 million Netflix shares as of early April. David Zaslav, CEO and president2024 compensation: $51.9M/+4.4%Median employee compensation: $130,316Zaslav pay ratio to median employee: 398 Few would point to the marriage of Warner Bros. and Discovery and declare it a glittering success. The media conglomerate’s market cap hovers at $22 billion, roughly half of where it stood in 2022 when the companies joined forces. Like many entertainment giants, Warner Bros. Discovery has struggled to manage the contraction of the theatrical movie business and the collapse of cable, its primary source of revenue. Yet Zaslav, the main architect of the merger, is still rewarded handsomely. His $51.9 million compensation package includes a $23.9 million bonus (more than 100% of the target amount), as well as a $3 million base salary, another $23 million in stock awards, a $17,446 car allowance and 250 hours of personal flight time each year on the corporate jet. Brian Roberts, CEO and chairman2024 compensation: $33.9M/-4.5% Michael Cavanagh, President2024 compensation: $28.25M/-4.5% Median employee compensation: $89,237Roberts pay ratio to median employee: 380 Roberts and chief lieutenant Cavanagh got big bonuses last year — just not as fat as they were in 2023. Comcast grew on the top and bottom lines in 2024, while free cash flow (a component used to determine executive compensation) declined 3.8% to $12.5 billion. The board’s compensation committee determined that the company’s top execs were entitled to cash bonuses equivalent to 109% of target. But both Roberts and Cavanagh “requested that they not receive more than 100% of their target bonuses,” according to Comcast’s proxy filing, settling for $7.5 million. In discussing their performance, the company cited the plan led by the pair to spin off NBCUniversal’s cable TV networks (excluding Bravo) and complementary digital assets. The new public company, Versant, is set to separate from its parent by the end of 2025. Lachlan Murdoch, CEO and executive chair2024 compensation: $23.8M/+9.3% Rupert Murdoch, Chairman emeritus2024 compensation: $21.2M/-7.7% Median employee compensation: $89,068Lachlan Murdoch pay ratio to median employee: 267 Rupert Murdoch, 94, officially retired in November 2023. But the TV news, sports and entertainment company he built continued to pay him generously. As chairman emeritus, he had a compensation package totaling $21.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 2024, which included $8.6 million worth of stock and options and a $2.3 million bonus “following 71 years of service to the company,” per Fox Corp.’s annual proxy filing. Eldest son Lachlan Murdoch, who now runs the media empire, saw his pay climb 9.3% largely thanks to a $6 million cash bonus (versus $4.5 million in fiscal 2023) based on “quantitative” and “qualitative” performance factors evaluated by the board. “Fox once again delivered strong operational and financial results in fiscal 2024,” the company said in its proxy filing, including Fox News ending the period as the No. 1 cable network among total viewers for the eighth straight year. Tim Cook, CEO2024 compensation: $74.6M/+18%Median employee compensation: $114,738Cook pay ratio to median employee: 650 After docking Cook’s stock incentives in 2023, Apple determined that it wasn’t paying him enough. Based on an analysis of CEO compensation at “peer companies” including Amazon, Disney and Netflix, the tech giant boosted the target value of Cook’s equity award for fiscal 2024 from $40 million to $50 million. Cook’s stock grants were calculated to be worth $58 million. To be sure, the tech giant kept minting money: Apple revenue hit a record $391 billion (up 2%) for the fiscal year ended September 2024, while net income declined 3% to (only!) $93.7 billion. Of note: Apple’s services biz, which includes the App Store and Apple TV+, generated $96 billion for the year, up nearly 13%. In justifying Cook’s enlarged stock grant, the board’s compensation committee cited “the impact his leadership has on the company’s short-term and long-term success.” Andy Jassy, CEO2024 compensation: $1.6M/+17.6%Median employee compensation: $37,181Jassy pay ratio to median employee: 43 Don’t be fooled: Jassy earns more for running the e-commerce mega-company than the number listed for his 2024 compensation on Amazon’s proxy statement. As reported under SEC rules, the CEO was paid $1.6 million last year. But the bulk of Jassy’s remuneration is in stock awards that vest over several years (which Amazon reported as compensation for 2021). According to Amazon, Jassy’s 2024 “realized compensation” increased by 37%, to $40.1 million, due to the company’s stock price gains. That came after his realized comp decreased by 12% in 2023. In his April 10 annual letter to shareholders, Jassy touted the company’s growing entertainment lineup, including originals like “Reacher,” “Fallout,” “The Boys” and “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power” and live sports like the NFL’s “Thursday Night Football” — with the NBA and Nascar coming later this year.

May 15, 2025 09:25 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, May 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that the Elevance Health class action lawsuit – captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., No. 25-cv-00923 (S.D. Ind.) – seeks to represent purchasers of Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) common stock and charges Elevance Health and certain of Elevance Health’s executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Elevance Health class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-elevance-health-inc-class-action-lawsuit-elv.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. Lead plaintiff motions for the Elevance Health class action lawsuit must be filed with the court no later than July 11, 2025. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Elevance Health operates as a health benefits company. Among other things, the cost of providing health benefits to members is driven by the level of care a patient requires, often referred to as “acuity,” and the members’ utilization of the health benefits, according to the complaint. The Elevance Health class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the class period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Medicaid redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance Health’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs; and (ii) this shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance Health’s rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Elevance Health class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 17, 2024, Elevance Health revealed that it was now “expecting second half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, the price of Elevance Health stock fell nearly 6%, according to the complaint. Then, on October 17, 2024, the Elevance Health class action lawsuit further alleges that Elevance Health announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that Elevance Health had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance Health further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue, according to the complaint. The Elevance Health class action lawsuit alleges that on this news, the price of Elevance Health stock fell nearly 11%. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Elevance Health common stock during the class period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Elevance Health class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Elevance Health class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Elevance Health class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Elevance Health class action lawsuit.

'삼성·LG'가 OS 굴기에 나섰으나 두 기업 '사이'상 협업이 될 리가 없었고 삼성은 타이젠에 실패해 초저가폰, 가전기기, 웨어러블 쓰고 있으며 LG는 시장에서 퇴출된 HP로부터 웹OS를 인수하여 '활용' 중입니다. 휴대폰 제국 노키아가 망할 줄 누가 알았고 '모토로라'가 망할 줄 누가 알았을까요? 모바일 시장에서 시장에서 도태된 수많은 기업들 중 하나였던 모토로라는 구글에 매각된 후 모듈폰 '프로젝트 아라' 실패 후 '레노버'에 매각을 했습니다.

'애플'은 SW와 HW를 판매하는 기업이라 OS 최적화에 이점이 있던 반면에 삼성전자는 구글에서 레퍼런스폰과 함께 새 OS를 출시하면 라이선스를 획득해서 커스텀 OS에 HW를 맞춰야 했습니다. HW 스펙을 올리면 소위 광탈이라 불렸던 배터리 사용량이 늘어날 수 밖에 없었고 삼성전자는 이 문제를 심플하게 해결했는데 배터리 크기를 키웠습니다. 설계 공간을 확보하면 발열(통풍) 처리가 유리하고 디스플레이 크기만큼 배터리 셀을 채워 넣을 수 있습니다.

'트럼프'가 하한선 10%라는 상호관세는 가격 경쟁력에 포함됩니다. '트럼프'가 미국을 다시 위대하게 제조업 국가로 만들겠다는 그 트럼프노믹스를 버티지 못하는 미국 IT 업계 중 일부는 반드시 모토로라와 IBM의 전철을 밟게 될 것입니다.

'국정농단'(공천개입)에 분열이 나서 '옥새파동'이 터져 '조선일보'와 '보수'가 탄핵 시킨 게 박근혜 전 대통령이었으며 더불어민주당은 오히려 역풍 우려에 탄핵에 소극적이었습니다. '세월호' 사태가 터지자 '박근혜' 즉시 '탄핵'을 주창했던 게 더불어민주당 '비주류'였던 '필승재명' 씨였습니다. “It will not be a steep step up, but a gradual one”Siemens CEO Roland Busch says China is "picking up momentum" in the automotive industry https://t.co/nn5VerOPr9 pic.twitter.com/0988G10e4G Beijing has pushed back against a US decision aimed at curbing Chinese-made artificial intelligence chips, a first sign of discord between the world’s two largest economies since they agreed to a trade truce last weekend. https://t.co/siYx8bEIv7 Trump's trade war has spared an industry Europe dominates: hearing aids.

The Hong Kong firm's attempt to sell most of its port operations to a US-led consortium was first announced in March after weeks of pressure from Donald Trump. The US president has refused to rule out military intervention to "take back" the crucial waterway -- which was handed over to Panama in 1999 -- from alleged Chinese control. Beijing has criticised the sale of the assets to a group led by giant asset manager BlackRock, opening an investigation into the deal to ensure it is handled lawfully. CK Hutchinson underlined on Monday that "the transaction would never be carried out in any illegal or non-compliant manner". Asked about the firm's statement on Thursday, a spokeswoman for China's commerce ministry said that "all parties to the transaction must not attempt to circumvent the review process in any way". No deal may be implemented without prior approval, He Yongqian said at a regular press conference, warning of "legal liability" in the event of proceeding without authorisation. "It is hoped that the companies involved will maintain a clear understanding of this and proceed with caution," said He. The business empire built by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing is registered in the Cayman Islands and the assets being sold are all outside China. Beijing's next moves in scrutinising CK Hutchison may also have far-reaching implications on Hong Kong and its role as China's business gateway to the world, analysts told AFP.

Title: US attorneys general fly free to luxury hotel in Rome thanks to group funded by corporate interests | CNN Politics

Follow: As thousands gathered to mourn the pope last month, a group of American state government officials were ushered past a lengthy line to a Vatican museum. They hadn’t come for a Pope Francis memorial, though. At the museum, Alaska Attorney General Treg Taylor snapped photos surrounded by a scrum of lawyers and lobbyists. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill smiled as she stood next to an attorney from a firm representing a company her office is suing. Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador chatted with the head of a corporate consultancy. Those attorneys general had all traveled to Rome for free – thanks to an association funded by some of the same companies whose representatives now chatted up the American officials. That group also organized the officials’ stay in an opulent, luxury hotel and their chauffeured sightseeing around the Eternal City. As CNN documented in March, companies have regularly paid to enjoy this kind of special access through the nonprofit Attorney General Alliance, which organizes trips to US resorts and foreign destinations. The AGA’s Rome trip offers the most detailed evidence yet of the close access corporate powers gain at these junkets – and of the potential conflicts of interest that come with that arrangement. Critics say that by accepting luxury trips funded by donations from corporate interests, attorneys general may undermine public trust in their actions, especially their mission to enforce the law against powerful interests. “It hurts the credibility of the office and the rule of law for attorneys general to use their status to elicit this kind of luxury travel,” said Stephen Gillers, a professor of legal ethics at NYU Law. “If they really need to meet… how about Chicago in January?” In a statement to CNN, AGA said the delegation to Rome included meetings with international law enforcement partners and Vatican officials on a range of issues including human trafficking. The trip also included accredited legal educational sessions for the attorneys general. “The goal of our meeting was to discuss solutions for stronger enforcement of the law and better protection for those who are trafficked as modern-day slaves,” AGA’s general counsel Tania Maestas said in the statement. Maestas said no litigation was discussed during the delegation and defended the attendance of state attorneys general. “To conflate lawful business travel with a violation of the rule of law is to substitute optics for legality,” Maestas said. “The credibility of an office is best preserved not by avoiding all activity that might be perceived unfavorably, but by upholding the rule of law.” A draft itinerary for the week-long Rome trip lists law enforcement meetings on topics like cryptocurrency and human trafficking in the mornings – but also other times blocked off for meals and tourism, like visits to museums and a tour of St. Peter’s Basilica. The schedule for Friday listed only an unspecified “optional excursion” and a “closing dinner.” Participants stayed at the five-star Rome Cavalieri hotel, which describes itself as an “opulent haven” and the “peak of prestige.” A CNN reporter spotted Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown resting with his eyes closed near the hotel pool on a sunny morning. A spokesperson for Brown’s office said he was honored to participate in the trip “to advance critical international law enforcement partnerships.” Documents show AGA covered business-class flights to Italy for the attorneys general and their guests. For example, AGA reimbursed Attorney General Brown and his wife for tickets totaling over $14,000, according to copies of the flight receipts obtained by CNN. An AGA staffer also booked tickets for Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and his wife, emails obtained through public records requests show. A separate AGA email last year touted the Rome trip as an “unforgettable experience.” AGA did not respond to a question about how many attorneys general attended the conference. CNN asked attorneys general offices in all 50 states whether they planned to participate. Thirty-two offices said they were not attending, and 16 did not answer. Brown’s office in Maryland confirmed that he was attending, and after the trip, a spokesperson for Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said that he attended with his family and secured a $100,000 grant from AGA to fight human trafficking. New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez also accepted an invitation for the trip, according to an AGA email from November obtained through a records request. A spokesperson for New York Attorney General Letitia James told CNN last month she was not attending. Hours after this story published, her office responded to a public records request with emails that show one of her staffer’s wrote to AGA in January, “AG James is a yes to Rome.” Her office did not immediately respond to a question about why she ultimately did not attend. CNN reporters in Rome also observed the attorneys general for Alaska, Idaho and Louisiana. AGA, which pulled in nearly $27 million in sponsorships between 2019 and 2023 – the last year of records available in public financial reports – largely relies on donations from companies to fund its trips. Attorneys general also pay thousands of dollars per year in membership dues using taxpayer funds. The group has previously granted varying levels of perks to companies based on how much they have contributed, records show. An AGA document from 2023, for example, promised sponsors who contributed $100,000 access to “invite-only events” and speaking slots at conferences not available to donors who gave $30,000. One donor listed in previous AGA documents is WilmerHale, an international law firm that represents companies across a range of industries. One of the firm’s partners, Paul Connell, attended the AGA trip to Rome, where he joined at least three state attorneys general and other business representatives for a tour of the Vatican Museums. After exiting the delegation’s tour bus, Connell stood beside Louisiana Attorney General Murrill at one point. This year, Murrill joined a dozen other Republican attorneys general in a lawsuit against investment companies alleging an anticompetitive conspiracy restricting coal production. Connell’s firm WilmerHale represents asset management company BlackRock in the case. The defendants in the lawsuit have argued the case “spins a farfetched theory” and fails to offer facts that demonstrate a conspiracy. Connell is not listed in court records as one of WilmerHale’s attorneys working on the case. Asked what, if anything, Connell discussed with Murrill on the trip, a WilmerHale spokesperson said conversations between firms and clients are privileged and noted that the Louisiana Department of Justice is a firm client. Murrill’s office did not respond to a question about whether her attendance and interaction with Connell in Rome posed a potential conflict of interest related to the BlackRock case. In an interview on the podcast Legal Speak last month, Murrill encouraged companies to engage with state attorneys general offices, though she seemed to acknowledge that access through AGA comes at a price. “It also can depend on the size of your business, what can you afford?” Murrill said. “The Attorney General Alliance is a membership organization but it has enormous value because you can engage on the front end … and you can meet a lot of attorney generals including your own in the states where you do business.” As the AGA tour group joined the line for the Vatican Museums, other corporate attorneys and lobbyists identified by CNN could be seen standing alongside the attorneys general. Among them was Kia Floyd, the vice president of state and local policy for General Motors, which was listed in a 2023 AGA document as one of the group’s sponsors. General Motors and Floyd did not respond to requests for comment. In the last year, General Motors was sued in separate cases by Texas and Arkansas over allegations regarding the company’s handling of private customer data. General Motors has denied the allegations and stated in court it has provided all necessary information for consumers to assess its products. A spokesperson for Arkansas Attorney General Griffin said his boss “met and exchanged pleasantries with Ms. Floyd but did not discuss the lawsuit against General Motors, which we are pursuing aggressively to hold GM accountable.” The Texas attorney general’s office did not respond to a question about whether he joined the Rome trip. Others identified in the Vatican tour group include Andrew Cook, a partner at the law firm Orrick, and Preston Baldwin, the CEO of corporate strategy firm, Centerpoint360. CNN confirmed their attendance by reaching their rooms at the Rome Cavalieri. They did not respond to requests for comment. “What I often counsel clients is state AGs are enormously important. You can’t neglect them. You have to go right to them… having a game plan put in place is really important,” Cook said during a webinar for the Federalist Society last year. Gillers, the NYU professor, said he doesn’t fault private companies for seeking to influence state officials. “I don’t blame them,” he said. “I blame the attorneys general for going. They should just say no.” © 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.

Title: Walmart’s tariff price hikes are likely weeks away

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Walmart said in February that it wasn’t “immune” from the costs of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Now it’s preparing shoppers to pay more, potentially within weeks. The retail giant is likely to start rolling out tariff-related price hikes “towards the tail end of this month, and I certainly expect more in June,” Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey told CNBC on Thursday, as the company reported earnings that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Sales rose by 4.5% at U.S. stores, and the company’s e-commerce business notched its first profitable quarter. Walmart is the nation’s largest private-sector employer, with a 1.6 million-strong U.S. workforce and 4,700 locations, which it says are within 10 miles of 90% of the population. The company pulled in $165.6 billion in revenue in the first quarter. It’s a challenging environment to operate in retail right now. Walmart Chief Financial officer John David Rainey But despite Walmart’s huge footprint at the center of the consumer economy, Rainey said “it’s a challenging environment to operate in retail right now,” speaking separately Thursday to Bloomberg. He indicated the Trump administration has further to go to resolve cost pressures that have risen at a scale and speed without “historical precedent,” echoing analysts on the heels of recent truces with the U.K. and China. Walmart’s stock was trading about 3.6% lower Thursday morning following its earnings report. Since Trump unveiled sweeping global tariffs on April 2 — then partially walked them back days later — its shares have risen 3.4%, outpacing the gains of Target and Costco, and remain up 2.9% since the start of the year. CEO Doug McMillon told investors Thursday that Trump’s 145% tariffs on China have had “the biggest impact” on the many toys and electronics Walmart sources there. He thanked the president for recent “progress” after the U.S. agreed to lower its effective tariff rate on China to 30% for a few months. “We’re hopeful that it leads to a longer-term agreement” and lower duties, he said. Rainey added on the investor call that many tariffs remain too high. Duties that in some cases are “approaching 50% for other countries is not a good outcome for retailers, not a good outcome for the economy,” he said. “Real prosperity is American workers being able to support their families and communities because they have good jobs that pay well and provide dignity,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. These goals matter more than “cheap Chinese toys,” he said, and pointed to cooler wholesale and consumer inflation data for April released this week. Walmart is feeling pressure to raise prices on bananas, avocados, coffee and roses due to tariffs on Costa Rica, Peru and Colombia, McMillon said. He promised the retailer would “do our best to control what we can control in order to keep food prices as low as possible.” That could include absorbing higher prices and opting to “not simply pass on a tariff cost attributable to each item individually,” McMillon said. “We also have suppliers shifting materials from tariff-impacted components like aluminum to fiberglass, where there is no tariff. Our merchants, sourcing team and suppliers are being creative.” Walmart is firing the starting gun on a period of price increases. Neil Saunders, managing director, globaldata Large companies typically have the most leeway to make adjustments like these. For many smaller operators, tariffs pose an existential threat that could allow big corporate rivals to expand their market shares, as the powerful U.S. Chamber of Commerce and independent shop owners themselves have warned. “If Walmart’s coming out — with its scale and its buying power and its focus — and saying prices are going to rise, everyone else is going to have to follow suit,” said Neil Saunders, managing director at retail consultancy GlobalData. “Walmart is firing the starting gun on a period of price increases.” Already, a number of companies that sell products at Walmart, such as Stanley Black & Decker, Adidas, Mattel and Procter & Gamble, have raised prices or signaled expected hikes. “Should the duties go away, there will of course not be price increases,” Adidas CEO Bjorn Gulden said in late April. “Should this duty stay or even be higher, then of course it will cause a price increase in the market in general.” Saunders said he expects grocery prices across the retail industry to rise 3% to 5% by the end of this year, while merchandise more dependent on global sourcing could jump by 5% to 7%. “It’s not just the odd 1% that people can almost absorb and ignore,” he said. “We’re looking at reasonably substantial inflation.” Other big-box retailers, including Home Depot, Lowes, Target and BJ’s Wholesale, are set to report first-quarter earnings next week. Several major consumer brands have already revised or scrapped their financial outlooks for the rest of the year, struggling to game out how ever-shifting trade policies will affect them. Walmart, for its part, maintained its 2025 sales and profit guidance. But it decided not to offer guidance on operating income or earnings per share for the second quarter now underway, due to “the range of near-term outcomes being exceedingly wide and difficult to predict.” Nationwide, retail sales rose just 0.1% in April, down sharply from a revised 1.7% increase in March, new federal data showed Thursday. Last month’s level was in line with analysts’ expectations but reflects consumers tightening their belts after a buying spree in which many scooped up products before more tariffs hit. Walmart said Thursday that it brought in new customers last month and saw growth among shoppers of all income levels. “They’re maybe a little concerned about possible looming price increases,” Rainey told CNBC. But so far, “their behaviors largely have not changed,” he said. “They’re still looking for value.” Steve Kopack is a producer at NBC News covering business and the economy. J.J.

Title: Serious BlackRock Bitcoin Warning Fuels ‘Disaster’ Fears As The Price Suddenly Dives

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has dropped back towards $100,000, falling sharply after a sudden surge fueled fears of a U.S. dollar collapse. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price, which earlier this week topped $105,000, has swung wildly over the last month as traders brace for further price shocks. Now, as Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly plotting to blow up the bitcoin price and crypto market, the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, has quietly added a serious warning about quantum computing to the list of risks to its huge spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has become one of the most bullish pro-bitcoin voices on Wall ... More Street, helping the bitcoin price to soar. “If quantum computing technology is able to advance […] it could potentially undermine the viability of many of the cryptographic algorithms used across the world’s information technology infrastructure, including the cryptographic algorithms used for digital assets like bitcoin,” BlackRock’s amended regulatory filing for its bitcoin fund read. BlackRock, which manages after around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street’s campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with a fleet of funds debuting in January 2024. BlackRock’s IBIT spot bitcoin ETF has since become one of the fastest growing ETFs of all-time helping to push the bitcoin price record highs and riding a bullish wave on the back of Donald Trump’s election as U.S. president in November after Trump declared himself the first “crypto president.” The fund now holds almost 3% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, worth $62 billion at the current bitcoin price, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network. “[BlackRock is] going to highlight any potential thing that can go wrong with any product they list or underlying asset thats being invested in,” James Seyffart, ETF analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, posted to X, adding such a warning is “completely standard.” However, the quantum computing risk to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has exploded recently, with tech giants including Google’s Alphabet making strides in quantum computing research. “At this point, no blockchain is ready to withstand a quantum attack when this becomes possible, which could very well be much earlier than 2030,” David Carvalho, the chief executive of decentralized post-quantum infrastructure blockchain Naoris Protocol, said in emailed comments. “Finance giants know the risk is there—BlackRock flagged the risk of quantum computing to bitcoin just this week. So why is the blockchain sector sleepwalking into a disaster?” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has recently topped $100,000 per bitcoin again but a BlackRock warning has sparked ... More fears bitcoin could be "sleepwalking into disaster." It has long been feared that if a company or government is able to create a fully-fledged quantum computer, it could be used to bypass the encryption that secures the blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, potentially rending the network vulnerable to a devastating hack. Such vulnerabilities could be patched with software updates. In February, Paolo Ardoino, the chief executive of USDT stablecoin issuer Tether, predicted that quantum computing would eventually enable hackers to break into inactive bitcoin wallets and steal dormant coins—including that linked to mysterious, anonymous bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. “Any bitcoin in lost wallets, including Satoshi (if not alive), will be hacked and put back in circulation,” Ardoino posted to X at the time, calling for development of "quantum-resistant addresses" and adding that "quantum computing is still very far from any meaningful risk of breaking bitcoin cryptography.”

(Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV), an AI infrastructure provider, recently announced its Q1 results, reporting a loss of $1.49 per share on revenue of $982 million. This exceeded market expectations of $853 million in revenue. However, its capital expenditures plan of $20-23 billion was much higher than the $18 billion anticipated by the analysts and it didn’t sit well with investors - triggering a decline in the stock in after-hours trading. Separately, see – Is UNH Stock Now A Falling Knife? Since its IPO at $40 per share in March, CRWV stock has surged past $65 earlier this week, significantly outperforming the NASDAQ index’s 11% gain over the same period. CoreWeave’s strong backlog of over $25 billion has contributed to its stock’s impressive performance. However, if you prefer a less volatile investment alternative, consider the High Quality Portfolio, which has consistently outpaced the S&P 500 and has delivered over 91% returns since inception. CoreWeave’s Q1 revenue of $982 million reflects an impressive 420% year-over-year increase. CoreWeave has secured significant contracts with leading AI labs, hyperscalers, and enterprises, including OpenAI, Microsoft, IBM, Meta, and Mistral AI, aiding its revenue growth. The first quarter also saw OpenAI solidify its relationship with CoreWeave by committing to a five-year deal worth up to $11.9 billion. This significant agreement underscores the growing importance of CoreWeave’s infrastructure for OpenAI. Additionally, CoreWeave’s adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 700 bps to 62%, up from 55% in the previous year’s quarter. However, the adjusted net loss widened to $150 million from $24 million in the prior-year quarter. Higher revenue offset by a contraction in net margin resulted in adjusted net loss of $0.61 per share. Looking ahead, CoreWeave expects Q2’25 revenue of $1.08 billion and full-year 2025 revenue of $5.0 billion, at the mid-point of the provided range. This fares better than the consensus estimates of $987 million and $4.6 billion, respectively. CRWV stock has shown some volatility since its debut. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, is significantly more stable. It has also comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why? This portfolio comprises stocks that have historically provided stronger returns with lower risk compared to the broader index, offering a more predictable performance, as evident in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current economic uncertainty surrounding tariffs and ongoing trade disputes, could CoreWeave sustain its upward trajectory? Since the stock was only listed last year, there is no historical data to assess its historical valuation multiple. At its current price of approximately $63 (after market hours), CRWV trades at 13 times trailing revenue. With sales increasing by over 700% in 2024, over 400% in Q1, and it’s expected to grow 2.3x this year, the company’s high valuation multiple appears justified. However, the company’s high capital expenditures and widening losses remain key near-term concerns.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The cryptocurrency market pulled back over the last 24 hours, led by declines in major coins as retail investors switched out of large-cap tokens and into smaller, more speculative assets. Both bitcoin BTC$102,943.60 and ether ETH$2,486.59 dropped around 2% and the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broad market, fell 2.7%. "We’ve observed a significant week-on-week increase in retail participation, reinforcing the broader narrative of rising optimism," said Jake O., an over-the-counter trader at Wintermute. “The shift down the risk curve is most evident in retail screen flows.” Institutional investors, for their part, have been more conservative. They're still stocking up on bitcoin, ether and XRP$2.36, while easing off positions in solana SOL$167.63 which has faced “sustained pressures.” “Some are viewing SOLETH underperformance as an opportunity to position for Solana topside,” Jake noted, pointing to steady buying in $200 Solana call options ahead of June and July. Other options activity suggests traders are hedging for volatility ahead. Call spreads on ether were unwound and some traders moved into collar structures — strategies often used to protect against price swings — signaling caution after recent gains. The growing hedging activity adds a note of caution to retail's swing to speculation. Economic uncertainty, lingering inflation pressures and U.S. tariff policy are all weighing on risk appetite in crypto as well as traditional markets. Global asset managers, in fact, currently have their largest underweight position in the U.S. dollar in 19 years. Even though President Donald Trump secured a major investment deal with Qatar and a temporary reduction in U.S.-China tariffs, these outcomes may lead to further downside: Spanish bank Bankinter said in a note that the market has shown fatigue over the last trading session. “We still think the damage is done: both EPS and prices should feel the strain, with rising inflationary pressures preventing the Fed from cutting rates as much as the market expects,” the bank’s analysts wrote. Market participants are set to now focus on producer price inflation and retail sales data, as well as on Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech later today. For the crypto market, a re-test of the all-time high isn’t out of the picture. “Looking ahead, we believe there is further room for digital assets to rally, especially as Coinbase’s inclusion into the S&P 500 on 19 May draws closer,” Singapore-based QCP Capital wrote.

Title: What's Next For AMD Stock After Recent 20% Gain

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. GERMANY - 2025/04/06: In this photo illustration, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. logo is seen displayed ... More on a monitor. (Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Advanced Micro Devices stock (NASDAQ:AMD) increased by more than 4% during Tuesday's trading session and has risen by nearly 20% over the last month. What factors are contributing to the stock's upward trend? Tuesday saw AMD unveil a $10 billion agreement with Humain, a startup based in Saudi Arabia supported by the nation’s sovereign fund. Humain intends to procure CPUs, GPUs, and software from AMD to enhance its data centers and AI infrastructure. Overall, Humain anticipates constructing data centers with approximately 1.9 gigawatts of power capacity by 2030. Importantly, Humain asserts that the arrangement with AMD is to avoid being dependent on a single vendor for AI-related hardware. This message is favorable for AMD stock, as we have noted that customers diversifying their suppliers away from Nvidia inherently presents an opportunity, especially considering the rapidly expanding AI market. Furthermore, sovereign AI—essentially state-funded initiatives for AI capabilities—is an area that semiconductor companies are increasingly focusing on, aiming to lessen reliance on a client base predominantly made up of large U.S. technology firms like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. It’s encouraging that AMD is also securing contracts in this sector. Separately, see – Is UNH Stock Now A Falling Knife? AMD's results for Q1 surpassed expectations, with its outlook for Q2 also exceeding predictions. Revenue grew by 36% to $7.44 billion in Q1, while earnings reached $0.96 per share. The growth was driven by robust data center sales, which surged 57% to $3.7 billion, thanks to increased GPU and CPU shipments. For quite some time now, AMD's CPUs have been gaining market share from Intel in the data center segment. Although AMD's GPU products do not match Nvidia's offerings at the high end, the AI surge is benefiting the overall market, with new large-scale models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o and China's DeepSeek R1 poised to drive increased demand for GPUs. As the company secures new GPU and AI data center agreements, and customers seek to diversify their chip sources, AMD stands to gain. Earlier this month, AMD mentioned that new U.S. export restrictions targeting its MI308 AI chips could cut its 2025 revenue by $1.5 billion. The company also indicated that it might incur a charge of up to $800 million related to inventory, purchasing commitments, and reserves associated with these restrictions. According to the new regulations, AMD must secure a license to ship advanced AI processors to China. This was perceived as a setback since China constitutes about 24% of its revenue. However, there seems to be a silver lining. U.S.-China trade relations appear to be improving, with both nations agreeing to suspend triple-digit tariffs for the next 90 days and making progress in discussions over the previous weekend. This fosters hope that chip export restrictions may soon be reviewed. The rise in AMD stock over the last four years has not been steady, with annual returns showing much more volatility compared to the S&P 500. The stock recorded returns of 57% in 2021, -55% in 2022, 128% in 2023, and -18% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has been significantly less volatile. Moreover, it has outperformed the S&P 500 comfortably over the last four years. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, offering a smoother performance as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Considering the current unpredictable macroeconomic landscape concerning rate reductions and ongoing international conflicts, could AMD experience a repeat of the underperformance seen in 2022 and 2024 compared to the S&P over the upcoming 12 months, or will it witness a notable surge? We assess AMD stock at approximately $107 per share, which aligns closely with its current market price.

(NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Ethereum’s Pectra Upgrade Enables Native ETH Staking For Institutions

ByLawrence Wintermeyer ByLawrence Wintermeyer, Contributor. Ethereum Pectra Upgrade May 7, 2025 The much-awaited Pectra upgrade on the Ethereum mainnet arrived on May 7. It will enable enhanced scalability for Layer-2 networks, reduce transaction fees, and increase validator staking limits. Ethereum upgrades are critical for the network to boost scalability and optimize security without compromising decentralization. The Pectra upgrade provides a new opportunity for institutional investors to enter the Ethereum ecosystem. “Ethereum continues to cement its position as the institutional blockchain of choice, and the Pectra upgrade only strengthens that narrative," Trevor Koverko, Web3 investor and co-founder of the startup Sapien, told me in an interview. “With native staking yields, deep liquidity, and a maturing regulatory perception, ETH staking has become an increasingly attractive destination for institutional capital seeking low-correlation, yield-generating exposure to crypto. Ethereum’s modular roadmap and protocol-level innovation uniquely position it to absorb this next wave of capital with both scalability and trust.” The Pectra upgrade will better enable traditional financial institutions to deploy capital reserves into native ETH staking for boosted rewards. Since institutional capital has historically preferred Ethereum as a settlement layer, the Pectra upgrade will further enhance the network’s capabilities to cater to institutional capital’s demands. The market has responded favorably to the Pectra upgrade. ETH’s market capitalization was up 42% by May 12, just five days following Pectra’s implementation. With a market cap of over $322 billion, Ethereum became the world’s 39th largest asset, in the good company of firms like Coca-Cola and Alibaba’s stocks. The ETH futures market also recorded a rise in open interest from $21.3 billion to $30.4 billion, signaling increased market activity and trader engagement. Unlike most crypto tokens, ETH’s price action is bolstered technical upgrades which help set the stage for further improvements and a sustained growth of the network. The Pectra upgrade brings almost a dozen Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) into a single release for an improved Ethereum ecosystem. Thomas Panicker, director of devops at EchoBase, explains “The Pectra upgrade is another critical step forward in Ethereum’s ongoing roadmap, combining both the Prague (execution layer) and Electra (consensus layer) upgrades to improve usability, security, and validator operations. A significant improvement in Ethereum’s Pectra is EIP-7251, which increases the staking limit or maximum validator staking balance from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH. Although validators will need 32 ETH to start staking, they’ll be able to earn rewards for up to 2,048 ETH in one validator instead of remaining capped at 32 ETH. Raising the ETH staking limit provides more flexibility to stakers who don’t hold ETH in multiples of 32. For instance, if someone has 50 ETH, they can now stake it under one validator to earn rewards on the full amount. Earlier, out of 50 ETH, they could stake just 32 ETH, and the remaining 18 ETH would remain idle. Bohdan Opryshko, co-founder and chief operating officer of Everstake, a leading institutional-grade non-custodial staking provider says, "The Pectra upgrade marks a major step toward making Ethereum significantly more appealing for institutional players. Most notably, we're seeing a 64x reduction in slashing risk. By consolidating infrastructure and reducing the number of validator nodes needed, institutions can now manage their staking setups with far greater efficiency and security. In practical terms, this means fewer human touchpoints, less room for operational errors, and dramatically easier infrastructure management." Further, the Pectra upgrade implements EIP-7002 for easier validator withdrawals, enabling validators to unstake directly through a simple Ethereum transaction instead of using the Beacon Chain. Subsequently, it makes institutional staking easier, providing stakers flexibility and lowering barriers even for those who aren’t technical experts. Earlier, staking service clients had to compulsorily obtain a signed message from staking service providers to exit their position. Since the message generation took about 13 hours, stakers had to wait till that time to exit. With Pectra, the exit delay is reduced to just 13 minutes, enabling quick staking withdrawals. Artemiy Parshakov, vice president of institutions at P2P.org, says, “The Pectra upgrade is a major unlock for institutional staking, especially with account abstraction paving the way for smarter, automated strategies. One area gaining traction is the automated calculation of the ideal withdrawal time for staked ETH. Instead of relying on static schedules, this approach dynamically evaluates real-time network conditions, like validator exit queues, churn limits, and forecasted reward rates, to identify the most advantageous withdrawal window. Paired with automated execution, it reduces manual overhead and maximizes returns.” Opryshko adds, "Withdrawal times are shrinking from up to 13 hours to as little as 13 minutes in some cases. That brings Ethereum closer to the liquidity expectations of traditional finance, where 2–3 business days is the standard, and even allows it to outperform them. If we can consistently offer liquidity in under a day, it removes a major friction point for large funds exploring on-chain staking. The Pectra upgrade also implements EIP-6110 for faster staking deposits to accelerate validator activation through processing staking deposits directly on Ethereum’s execution layer. This makes staking seamless, reduces wait times, and improves efficiency, enabling validators to earn faster rewards. Simultaneously, EIP-7685 offers enhanced communication between Ethereum’s execution and consensus layers, improving validator actions like deposits and withdrawals, thereby making Ethereum staking much smoother. Whereas EIP-7549 makes Ethereum validator voting more efficient, making its staking system scalable and less resource-intensive. Panicker adds, “One of the most notable enhancements is EIP-3074, which introduces advanced account abstraction capabilities — enabling smart contract-style behavior from externally owned accounts (EOAs). This change could significantly simplify user interactions and improve wallet design, potentially helping with broader adoption.” Regular wallets function like smart contracts through gas fee sponsorship, passkey authentication, and batching transactions, help to reduce friction during transaction processing. The combined benefits of implementing multiple EIPs in the Pectra upgrade make ETH staking conducive for institutional capital. Critics often point out TradFi money doesn’t flow into Ethereum citing ETH ETFs have just over $5 billion in AUM compared to $115 billion for bitcoin ETFs. It is not a fair comparison, more apples and oranges and conflates the fundamentals. BTC is a store of value, ETH is a utility - the Ethereum network has emerged as the preferred base layer for institutions for transacting digital assets. Major financial institutions like BlackRock, the European Investment Bank, Deutsche Bank, and UBS, use Ethereum for deploying their on-chain strategies. The institutional preference for Ethereum comes from its credibility as a decentralized and secure public network. Ethereum hosts over 58% of tokenized real-world assets, over 52 % of the DeFi industry’s total locked value, and 95% of stablecoin volume. Wall Street investors prefer Ethereum for its network effects, high liquidity reserves, and composability, unlike other blockchains that have become token islands or private walled gardens, all which fragment liquidity creating inefficiencies and driving usage costs up. Ethereum has also adopted new security token standards like ERC-3643 and ERC-1400 with built-in KYC and AML compliance mechanisms. Subsequently, in March 2025, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, the post-trade market infrastructure that processes $3.7 quadrillion in security transactions, now supports the issuance and management of ERC-3643 tokens. Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin Terminal, elaborated, “Besides security and decentralization, transparency and seamless user experience are key to deploying successful on-chain products. The Pectra upgrade stands out for making ETH staking simple and attractive for institutional investors with more rewards, faster deposits and withdrawals, and enhanced efficiency. So we can expect more institutions to now participate in ETH staking for generating yields.” Ethereum’s native staking yield makes it a lucrative fixed-income instrument within the digital asset space. TradFi players and institutions can leverage the yield from ETH staking to other financial instruments for generating additional income. As Panicker further explains, “For enterprises and protocol developers, it’s a signal that Ethereum is not just evolving technically, but maturing toward a more developer-friendly and scalable base layer. While the Pectra upgrade doesn’t directly impact our business model today, these innovations move the ecosystem toward more modular and abstracted infrastructure — something that can eventually benefit wallet providers, custodial services, and L2 integrations by offering more flexibility, especially around permissions and transaction delegation.” A decade ago, Ethereum transformed the digital asset industry with its smart contract functionalities, making decentralized applications accessible to users. Ten years later, it continues to be the forerunner in technical innovation. The Pectra upgrade will be followed by Fusaka and Glamsterdam upgrades to handle big data and optimize gas. These upgrade will continue to make Ethereum the preferred destination for institutional capital to build products, participate in native ETH staking, and drive future-proof digital RWA and new and innovative product and collateralization use cases.

Title: Mitsotakis, Adonis and “the short legs”, Laskaridis’ proposal to shipowners, Divani, President for sale, the government’s message to Ivan Savvidis

Full Content:
Hello, yesterday was a day that in terms of news was essentially characterized by what we call in our journalistic jargon “aftermath” from the NTUA report on Tempi. In Parliament we had… many goals and spectacle from Floridis who, although he doesn’t look like it, when he opens his little mouth not even the Galikos river near his hometown in Kilkis can wash you clean, since he found Velopoulos in front of him and turned him into balm with everything this charming and picturesque guy was saying—who, frankly, I don’t see why anyone would want to argue with him, really. Everyone knows there’s always a…Velopoulos in Parliament for as long as I can remember. You’ll say that these pagan-style theories about the 13 missing railcars, the 33 tons of wood alcohol, the smugglers, and the hidden NATO weapons in the railcars, etc., have been heard from the entire opposition for the past three months and we almost believed them too, but never mind, if only the trains had been fixed and so many innocent lives hadn’t been lost and everything else just confirms that the conspiracy crowd was and will always be among us. And the Opposition? Now in the “serious opposition” —and in that, apart from our leader Nikos, I now also include SYRIZA— which since the day before yesterday has been struck by what Vissi sings, “awkwardnesssssss, awkwardnessss, what can you say to me, what can I say to youuuuuu.” Some minor announcements, some half-statements about the Karonis report, there’s also that proposal for a preliminary investigation by PASOK, we’ll see if anything else comes up because on the Tempi issue “we pretty much got screwed,” as Tzakri says. Mitsotakis–Adonis Yesterday Mitsotakis appeared alongside Adonis at the ygeiamou.gr (our own) conference and before going on stage to speak, a nearby interlocutor asked him what he would say about the Karonis report since he was bound to be asked—especially by the discussion’s moderator Sroiter, who hadn’t seen him since the infamous and very difficult interview he gave him on Alpha three months ago. So, Adonis, who had spoken at the conference a few minutes earlier and had said, “I’ve learned to speak my mind and shout whatever I believe is true,” encouraged him (K.M.) to…say everything right then and there about Tempi. “Say a good word for me too, President, that I was right in the end,” Georgiadis said to him smiling, but Mitsotakis chose to refer very briefly to the Tempi issue, simply because he knows very well that it doesn’t lend itself to celebration. So he limited himself to publicly declaring that “it always proves that lies have short legs, we’ll say the rest in Parliament.” Laskaridis’ idea for €1 billion in annual sponsorships Meanwhile, yesterday morning before heading to the ygeiamou.gr conference, Mitsotakis went to the facilities of the Supreme Military Command of the Interior and Islands (ASDEN), where together with Dendias and the Army leadership they inaugurated four ultra-modern drones that will be integrated into the overall weapon system “Achilles’ Shield,” and as the responsible minister said, will excellently oversee the security of our islands in the Aegean from above. (…those old P-3B Orion planes of Kammenos are no match!). This new weapons system is yet another donation from Thanasis Laskaridis, who a few months ago also donated the Special Cyber Unit currently under construction at the Ministry of National Defense. So, after the Prime Minister and the Minister thanked Laskaridis for his ongoing contributions, the shipowner himself took the floor and said: “In Greece today we have more than 300 serious shipping firms (i.e., shipowners); if the 100 largest of them gave a donation of 10 million euros each annually, we’d gather a significant amount of about 1 billion euros. Such an amount would be extremely useful either for national defense or for our country’s other major problem, the demographic issue.” Let’s see, let’s see, will anyone listen to the proposal? Because honestly, 1 billion euros a year in state sponsorships could make a huge difference everywhere—in healthcare, in education, and in demographics, apart from defense of course. Divani – President remain in the frame for sale Let’s start with the hotel market, where developments are dense and often some deals that seem stalled remain warm. Thus, banking sources said that the process of selling the Divani Group hotels has not been frozen, even though the non-binding offers gathered by Citigroup as financial advisor came… below the threshold that had been set at around 700 million euros. At the same time, there seems to be movement with the President Hotel on Kifisias Avenue in Ampelokipi. One of the hotel’s strong advantages, apart from its location, is that it has a large number of rooms—517 in total—while it is said there’s interest from funds and foreign groups that have been steadily expanding their presence in the domestic market in recent years. ThPA (OLTH): The behind-the-scenes, the message, and the guarantees Yesterday at noon, a few hours before the start of the shareholders’ general assembly of the Thessaloniki Port Authority (OLTH), the state’s representative on the port’s board sent a new letter withdrawing his objections to convening the assembly. The people from the Superfund clearly did not decide to make fools of themselves with back-and-forth decisions. The behind-the-scenes that preceded relates to the overall change in stance and strategy of the Superfund across all companies it participates in, and a message that it is not a passive shareholder that simply rubber-stamps management decisions. And it doesn’t stop there. For the first time in a while, the government—through the Superfund’s stance—sent a message to every concessionaire that infrastructure progress concerns not only investors but also the state, which remains the infrastructure owner. Therefore, it demands development according to master plans and, of course, implementation of mandatory investments that must be executed within each infrastructure’s investment period. In OLTH’s case, the exercise is even more complex: there are other projects with political and social significance that share the same investor. Consequently, the need for the immediate launch of Pier 6 and other projects at OLTH moved high on the agenda with the emphasis “urgent.” The government wants Thessaloniki—with the port, the Egnatia Highway, the Gonou military camp, the HELEXPO, and the new healthcare infrastructure—to become a strong economic hub and bridge for the Western Balkans and Europe. Before giving its approval for the General Assembly to proceed, the Superfund set and received specific guarantees for the immediate start and uninterrupted completion of the projects within schedule. Ivan, the power shifts on the Board, and the Government’s intentions Tomorrow the €2 per share dividend of OLTH will be “cut,” which after a 5% tax withholding comes to a net amount of €1.90. Shareholders witnessed a general assembly with suspicious calm. It became clear that Ivan Savvidis’ side wants to impose new balances on the Board of Directors. Thanasis Liagos technically has not resigned yet, but he will not be in the position of President in the new Board and seems caught in a tug-of-war among the involved (shareholding) sides, while he will assume the position of management advisor. Today, the shareholding structure at OLTH is 67% owned by South Europe Gateway Thessaloniki (SEGT) Ltd (6,753,600 shares), 7.3% by the Superfund (732,594 shares), and the remaining 25.7% of the share capital (2,593,806 shares) belongs to the general investing public. Let’s also recall the government’s intervention in the Volos Port tender, where awarding it to Ivan Savvidis was canceled—a development that also reveals its intentions and disposition regarding Thessaloniki’s future. Airports are soaring The 14 regional airports managed by Fraport Greece continue to show steady growth, with total passenger traffic recording a 4.9% increase in April, reaching 1.75 million passengers. At the beginning of the summer season, international traffic also rose by 4.9%, reaching 1.14 million passengers. As expected for this period, Thessaloniki recorded the highest volume of traffic among the 14 airports (Aktio, Chania, Corfu, Kavala, Kefalonia, Thessaloniki, Zakynthos, Kos, Mytilene, Mykonos, Rhodes, Samos, Santorini, Skiathos), with over 626 thousand passengers, up 8.1%. For Thessaloniki in particular, international traffic figures are even more encouraging, with a 9.4% increase reaching 389 thousand passengers. Among the major destinations, Rhodes had a strong start with a 12% increase compared to April last year, reaching 378 thousand passengers, while Chania recorded a 6.5% increase (199 thousand passengers), and Corfu 4.9% at 171 thousand. Although with a smaller volume of 36 thousand passengers, Mytilene is a pleasant surprise with double-digit growth rates, +17.3% in April for combined domestic-international traffic and +10.6% for international traffic alone. Santorini is the big loser of April with a -27.8% drop, slightly above 129 thousand passengers, while Mykonos showed a marginal increase of 1% with slightly over 46 thousand passengers, and a 9.3% drop in international traffic (around 17.5 thousand). For the four-month period, total passenger traffic from January to April 2025 exceeded 3.9 million passengers compared to 3.77 million in the same period last year (+3.7%), with international traffic accounting for over 2 million, marking a 5.7% increase from last year. Thessaloniki alone accounts for over half of this four-month traffic, or over 2 million passengers, up 8.3%, with international traffic specifically reaching +10% and 1.247 million passengers. The master builder’s drought Dimitris Koutras, a “master builder” of the sector, saw his plans for Domiki Kritis not unfold quite as he had hoped. The leap from a local construction company to one with nationwide reach, even if you have the experience, requires time, structure, and organization. And in those areas, the company still has a long way to go. The slowdown in the pace of construction projects is also reflected in the profits of the most recent fiscal year (217,000 euros compared to 2.771 million euros in 2023) for Domiki Kritis—a picture that is also reflected on the stock board, with the share price falling below 2 euros. Since last August, Domiki Kritis has been the provisional contractor for the Kelefina dam (tendered in 2023), valued at 25 million euros. However, due to legal appeals, the contract has stalled. If all goes well, according to sources, the signatures are expected soon, as the outcome favors the company, offering a lifeline to the current project backlog which is below 40 million euros and struggling to “get off the ground” with new contracts. The company is also the lowest bidder for a pedestrian bridge in Elliniko and has secured the renovation of the Panteion University building. Non-stop deals in insurance The capital increase in Europe Holdings is nearing completion (the rights exercise period ends tomorrow, 16/5, and trading of the new shares on the Athens Exchange is expected to begin on 26/5), and acquisition time has arrived. In fact, there are two acquisitions: NAK Insurance Brokers is being acquired, and, as many expected, full control is being taken of AMYNA – Insurance Brokers, which for years had shareholders from the Kokkalis Group. At the same time, the stock of Intracom Group’s subsidiary has gained momentum on the board, and its capitalization has reached 250 million euros. The insurance sector as a whole is undergoing intense activity, and in the coming period, we will see more deals across the entire market spectrum, regardless of size. Already, Mega Brokers of the Chatziotheodosiou family, a major player in Greek insurance brokerage, has acquired “Athinaiki Insurance Agents,” a company with a 30-year presence in insurance consulting and program management. HelleniQ Energy won’t impress The results that HelleniQ Energy will announce today will not excite the investment community. Reduced profitability—among other external factors—is due to the fact that one of its two refineries (Elefsina) remained closed for maintenance for four weeks. Additionally, there was a significant decline in international oil prices and refining margins. Sources indicate that the refining margin for the first quarter of 2025 dropped to $5.2/barrel compared to $7.8/barrel in the same period last year. As a result, the first quarter of 2025 for HelleniQ Energy includes reduced production (due to the closed refinery) along with increased energy and payroll expenses. Nevertheless, the stock of HelleniQ Energy is closely tracking Motor Oil, which has already reached a capitalization of 2.5 billion euros. Yesterday, HelleniQ Energy closed the session at €7.98 (+1.72%) and its capitalization exceeded €2.4 billion. OLP hit 1.1 billion euros Although the MSCI restructuring did not involve changes to the main index for Greek stocks, it held a pleasant surprise for OLP. The stock was included in the MSCI Greece Small Cap Index and is now more visible to the investment community. This development acted as an extra “fuel,” resulting in the extension of its historical record. Specifically, yesterday it rose by 3.5% to 44.5 euros and reached up to 45 euros at the day’s high. Trading activity also picked up compared to usual levels, with a turnover of 939 thousand euros and over 21 thousand shares traded. The stock’s performance this year is estimated at +48.3%, while its market value now exceeds 1.1 billion euros. The average target price is set at 48 euros, which means there is an upside potential of about 7.9% from current levels. An additional catalyst is the proposed dividend of 1.92 euros for fiscal year 2024, up 43.7% compared to 2023, when it was 1.34 euros. The “green light” is expected to be given at the annual general meeting on July 22. The ex-dividend date is scheduled for August 4, and payment for August 8. The Qualco Party The trading of Qualco’s stock starts today at €5.46. Following the impressive oversubscription of the Public Offering, only 10% reached retail investors, which might justify a “small party” for the stock in its early trading days. Approximately €563 million was offered in the Public Offering. A total of 20,700,000 common registered shares of the group were made available. Excluding the shares allocated to Cornerstone investors—Latsco Hellenic Holdings, Antenna Group BV, and Green Hydepark—the remaining shares were oversubscribed 8 times. Of the €563 million submitted in the Public Offering, €189 million came from subscriptions outside Greece. Qualco raised €47.7 million in net funds, which management pledged to use for its 5-year investment plan focused on strategic mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in Greece and beyond. Stock Market: The Mood Shifted After 4 PM The goal is clear: the General Index wants to conquer 1,800 points. However, from 1,780 points and beyond, there are many interested sellers who would prefer to lock in profits, since the General Index has already gained over 21% since the beginning of the year. At the same time, investors are awaiting tomorrow’s derivatives closing. Yesterday, the General Index began with the usual “short-term profit-taking,” dropping to 1,780.99 points (-0.42%), but after 4 PM, buyers reappeared in the banks, pushing the Index up to 1,790.99 points (+0.14%). There were numerous block trades totaling over €32.9 million, while the total trading value reached €175.5 million. OPAP recorded the swiftest rebound after its dividend cut and, with trades worth €15.3 million (including a €4.84 million block at €20.17), closed at its highest price in the last 16 years at €20.2 (+0.5%). All banks (except National Bank) closed in positive territory. GEK TERNA (+1.74%) reached €19.25, AKTOR (+1.32%) €5.38, and Aegean (+1.09%) €12.96. OTE’s results did not satisfy the market, and the stock dropped to €17.1 (-1.44%). Despite market expectations, TITAN was not included in the MSCI Greece Standard Index, and the stock fell -0.48% to €41.75, while JUMBO—despite its charming new radio ad—saw profit-taking at €28.28 (-0.56%). Genekor to Announce New Deal Genekor Medical SA is a 100% Greek company in the field of molecular diagnostics in Europe. It already operates branches in 8 countries. Sources report that within the coming days (or hours?), it will announce another Balkan deal. The agreement concerns a strategic alliance with Kandilarov Medical Diagnostic Laboratories, a leading player in healthcare in Bulgaria. The two companies will leverage their expertise in research, development, and—most importantly—access. Their collaboration will focus on key areas of molecular oncology such as treatment response, identification of hereditary syndromes, and early cancer detection. Greece is exporting know-how in high-level healthcare services. Even the Scandinavians Are Now Considering Nuclear Power “Nuclear energy? No, thanks,” was the stance of Scandinavians in the 1980s. Today, things seem to have changed. Denmark—the country of wind turbines and cool energy—is now reconsidering its 1985 nuclear ban. Sweden, which closed most of its nuclear power plants over the past decade, has also changed course, with the new government supporting nuclear power, given that artificial intelligence requires massive amounts of energy. In 2005, Danes celebrated Sweden’s closure of a nuclear plant near their capital, Copenhagen. Today, they are “studying” next-generation mini reactors. Lars Aagaard, Denmark’s Minister of Climate, Energy and Public Utilities, is scheduled next week to argue in parliament in favor of small nuclear reactors. “There’s progress in new nuclear energy technologies with small modular reactors.” Large energy demands are leading to a different approach toward the once-taboo issue of “nuclear.” Explore related questions

Title: Trump Smoke and Mirrors on Full Display in Claimed “$142 Billion” Saudi Arms Deal

Given how the spectacle of Trump going to the Middle East and collecting cash and prizes like his much-hyped $142 billion Saudi arms “deal”, part of a purported $600 billion investment package, and his much-criticized Qatari airplane “gift”, Bloomberg has provided a useful service in picking apart the inflated figures in the arms agreement claim. Even though it’s important to understand how great the Trump claim inflation is, so that recipients will hopefully apply a large discount any time Trump makes a grand pronouncement, he persists in this behavior because it is an effective form of cognitive anchoring. The public and press will remember the $142 billion, and not any properly haircut figure. Consider another recent example, Trump’s loud claim that the US acted as a mediator in the India-Pakistan ceasefire talks. Washington Monthly explained how that claim was not only false but actually detrimental: India and Pakistan have reached a ceasefire in their recent conflict, which significantly decreases the risk of a nuclear war this week. However, the amateur-hour way Donald Trump’s administration handled this crisis increased (if only slightly) the chance of a nuclear exchange down the line. It illustrates why Trump’s everything-is-about-me style of governance isn’t just a harmless embarrassment, but a daily disaster…. First, Trump claimed credit for the ceasefire, boasting that the U.S. had “mediated” it. India issued an immediate denial, but the mistake ran deeper than poaching an honor. In diplomacy, words matter. And as everyone in the region knows, the word “mediate” is a diplomatic landmine. Ever since 1947, India has strenuously rejected outside “mediation” of the Kashmir conflict…. Did the U.S. play an intermediary role in helping India and Pakistan reach a ceasefire agreement? Sure—as did Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, and China (none of which rushed to the microphones to seize credit). As India stated in smacking down Trump’s claim, it was the two parties themselves who reached an accord, not any external actor seeking to impose “mediation.” … Second, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a far more substantive negotiation than the one approved. Mindful of his boss’s unquenchable thirst to be seen as a master deal-maker, Rubio posted that the two nations had agreed to “talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.” A “broad set of issues” really means “long-term disposition of Kashmir”— or at least that’s how Pakistan wants (and India fears) these words will be interpreted. Did Modi agree to such negotiations, and in response to a terrorist action? Vanishingly unlikely. Did India agree to any talks on any topic? Unlikely, but not impossible, although India immediately denied this, too. So even if Rubio’s statement contained a kernel of truth, any talks were ones India intended to keep secret. Rubio’s decision to spotlight them (if they even existed) stroked Trump’s ego, but at the expense of progress or U.S. credibility…. Another dangerous result of Trump and Rubio’s statements is that they unwittingly promoted Pakistan’s agenda, thereby encouraging a replay of the same hazardous behavior. There’s more where that came from, but you get the drift of the gist: Trump’s claims were wildly inflated His extreme ego needs are harmful to international security John Helmer has said that the Russians have realized they are negotiating with a cult of personality and have been proceeding accordingly. But there is another implication: look how many words it took to debunk the Trump claim and question the Rubio follow on (as in either its accuracy or its propriety). How many people pay that much attention, let alone have a tolerance for complex arguments? This is the general problem with bullshit. It takes a minimum of 3x the space, and often more than 10x, to disprove it. Similarly, a new article in the Financial Times, What has Elon Musk’s Doge actually achieved?, takes a harsh look at the many promises made, from cost savings to transparency, and finds them sorely wanting. The pink paper, as many others have, documents among other things how DOGE grossly inflated cost cuts and took credit for reductions that were already baked in. It even contends the DOGE approach was destined to do more harm than good: Doge “got off in the wrong direction because it attacked exactly the wrong thing,” says Matt Calkins, chief executive of software company Appian, which powers much of government procurement and has worked with the initiative on some cost-cutting measures. “Of all the things you could do to affect the government, it would have been better to go after regulation. It would have been better to go after entitlements. Just blowing up jobs was a good way to make enemies, a good way to cause more disruption than progress.” But this detailed analysis (the full article is very much worth a read) misses a major, if not the point, of DOGE nevertheless advancing the reactionary libertarian agenda of destroying government services. The Big Lie repetition of “fraud” has been effective. Fraud is a risk in all commercial activity, even one to one dealings. The question for any organization is the cost and effectiveness of fraud prevention and mitigation measures. In just about all instances, having anti-abuse measures that are so stringent as to reduce it to zero is too costly, both in terms of hard outlays like staffing, as well as more complex considerations (for businesses, alienating potential customers; for government, greatly restricting delivering services to target populations). For instance, a long-standing ally of the site casually mentioned of the Trump demolition exercise, that Something (by implication, Something Big) needed to be done. I disputed that contention. With complex systems, like human bodies, even if there is a problem, limited interventions are always preferred to radical ones, so a stent is a better solution (if viable) than a heart replacement. The big reasons include less risk to the patient, lower costs, plus the conservative treatment typically does not preclude more aggressive ones later. But in keeping with the idea that DOGE was at least in part a messaging operation, we’ve had far too many otherwise intelligent readers pump for a teardown…with no real logic as to why, let alone any clue of what comes next. Now to Bloomberg on the Saudi arms deal puffery, politely headlined as US-Saudi $142 Billion Defense Deal Sparks Questions, Few Answers. Key extracts: The Trump administration called its $142 billion defense deal with Saudi Arabia “the largest defense sales agreement in history.” Critics aren’t so sure…. But like the broader $600 billion economic deal that it was a part of, the defense agreement lacked any specifics. And skeptics of the administration immediately pointed to questions around the numbers. One is that Saudi Arabia’s entire defense budget this year is $78 billion, estimated Bruce Riedel, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Yves here. Both the Administration and Congress have a habit of using CBO scoring numbers, which tally total outlays over the next ten years for a particular program or piece of legislation, as the cost, which many news-readers mistakenly treat as expected next-year outlays. But if that was the treatment, there should have been some disclosure, say in a yet-to-be-produced briefing paper. Back to Bloomberg: Democratic and Republican administrations alike have a long history of re-purposing previous deals into sweeping, headline-grabbing agreements for presidents to sign during trips. Trump did it before, during his first-term trip to Saudi Arabia in 2017, when he announced the Saudis would spend $110 billion on US weapons to modernize the kingdom’s military. That package included deals negotiated under the Obama administration and others that were in the initial stages of a lengthy process requiring congressional approval and negotiations between the buyer and defense contractors. To date, the 2017 deal has yielded more than $30 billion in implemented foreign military sales to Saudi Arabia, according to a State Department fact sheet in January…. If deals do eventually emerge from the White House and Saudi Arabia, experts will start sorting through what was new and what was old. Already, there are more than $129 billion in active military sales to Saudi Arabia from the US, according to the State Department fact sheet. Yves again. So perhaps only $13 billion in incremental commitments? To Bloomberg again, which stresses that the hype has commercial value to the US: “A lot of this is about the optics, but the optics matter,” said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. “It’s an attempt to send a message of reassurance after several years of uncertainty in the US-Saudi bilateral relationship on defense cooperation.” The agreement is likely to yield real gains, particularly in the realm of missile defense, where the US has much to offer and Saudi Arabia has significant needs, said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute focusing on defense strategy and budgeting. At a time when some of the US’s traditional allies in Europe may be reluctant to purchase weapons from Washington, Saudi Arabia’s willingness to do so is especially welcome, he said. Regular readers are likely wondering why the Saudis and the Europeans are so keen about US weapons, given not just the way Russian systems have regularly proven to be superior in Ukraine, but even the way the stereotyped sandal-wearing Houthis chased the US out of Middle East waterways. The practical difficulty (aside from the elephant in the room of geopolitics) of integrating disparate systems is large, including training of operators. The Russians make a big point of backwards integration in the operation of major systems like military planes: if a soldier knows an old system, it will be close to trivial for him to learn to manage a new one. By contrast, Ukraine military pilots had grown up flying Soviet planes. Many experts warned that trying to retrain them to operate Western aircraft was an impossible ask. If they had to undertake an action under high pressure, they would default to what amounted to muscle memory in flying the Soviet jets, which would be all wrong for the Western ones. The high level of not-well-explained losses of Ukraine-operated F-16s validates this concern. However, an upside of this Saudi arms buy is that it has the Israels worried. Bloomberg mentions that in passing: Even without specifics, some analysts said the scale and complexity of weapons purchases contemplated by Saudi Arabia could risk compromising Israel’s “qualitative military edge” in the region, which US presidents for decades have committed to maintain…. But Dana Stroul, director of research at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said that the categories outlined by the White House have long been part of Saudi Arabia’s military modernization plans. Absent more detail about particular weapon systems, they don’t raise alarms about qualitative military edge, said Stroul, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East. A very long article in the Times of Israel, Trump signs deals with Saudis, including biggest-ever $142 billion arms agreement, has a banner above the header laying out a key worry: Expert: Gulf states stronger friends for Trump than Israel? The article weighs heavy on, and is clearly unhappy about, all of the pomp and circumstance during Trump’s visit. There is an absence of substance about the deals, but a lot not-well-coded whining: Biden had decided to pay a visit to Saudi Arabia as he looked to alleviate soaring prices at the pump for motorists at home and around the globe. At the time, Prince Mohammed’s reputation had been badly damaged by a US intelligence determination that found he had ordered the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But that dark moment appeared to be a distant memory for the prince as he rubbed elbows with high-profile business executives — including Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk — in front of the cameras and with Trump by his side… Saudi Arabia and fellow OPEC+ nations have already helped their cause with Trump early in his second term by stepping up oil production…. William Wechsler, senior director of the Rafik Hariri Center and Middle East Programs at the Atlantic Council, said Trump’s decision to skip Israel on his first Middle East visit was remarkable. “The main message coming out of this, at least as the itinerary stands today, is that the governments of the Gulf … are in fact stronger friends to President Trump than the current government of Israel at this moment,” Wechsler said. Admittedly, the Times does land a blow in its brief mention of corruption: The three countries on Trump’s itinerary — Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates — are places where the Trump Organization, run by the president’s two oldest sons, is developing major real estate projects. They include a high-rise tower in Jeddah, a luxury hotel in Dubai, and a golf course and villa complex in Qatar. Finally, the apparently big, even if again considerably exaggerated “$600 billion” investment pledge counters the idea that the US is no longer a good place for foreign capital, as demonstrated by exits from US stocks post “Liberation Day” on a scale to seriously weaken the dollar. A final question is what if anything the show of fealty by Middle Eastern states to US means for BRICS. As we have pointed out repeatedly, a big problem for BRICS is the comparative dearth of high GDP per capita states as members. China’s GDP per capita is less than 1/6 that of the US. Even if you use PPP per capita. China’s level is less than 1/3 of that of the US. Lower incomes means less economic surplus. Saudi Arabia’s GDP per capita is roughly 2.5 times that of China’s, so it has the potential to be a powerful addition to BRICS. But if it continues to maintain relations with both the US and what is perceived to be a China-led sphere, as India has said it intends to do, does that limit how much it support BRICS? And let me remind reader, BRICS so far is much less substantive than most readers imagine. It does not even have a budget, unlike the (perceived to be) much less ambitious ASEAN or Shanghai Cooperation Organization. So this is a long-winded way of demonstrating, frustratingly, how effective hype can be. How to counter it well remains an open question. For someone who has such open contempt for the law, Trump is an ardent and abiding follower of Brandolini’s law. Also known as the bullshit assymetry principle. Re: India v. Pakistan. John Helmer has a different take on events, talking to Ray McGovern with Nima. He said that while we know India lost several aircraft, we don’t know about Pakistan’s losses in the air, but we do know about Pakistan’s losses on the ground — loss of command and control (!) — which triggered movement of Pakistan’s nuclear forces, which triggered movement of India’s nuclear forces. Helmer thinks that is when Pakistan called Washington begging for mediation. https://youtu.be/rY_pZu_anJU?t=4440 https://archive.ph/jiC8h NYT would agree. There was no mediation. Please do not use that word. The US freelancing and calling both sides does not amount to mediation. Seems the lie served a purpose: selling out Trump branded luxury apartments. https://theprint.in/india/trump-residences-in-gurugram-sold-out-days-after-us-president-claimed-he-brokered-ceasefire/2627053/ Thanks for this breakdown! As always, laughing out loud at the sheer mendacity of it all! LOL #TheKicker > The three countries on Trump’s itinerary — Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates — are places where the Trump Organization, run by the president’s two oldest sons, is developing major real estate projects. Bwaaahahahaha! Yes, strike one blow … for corruption. Your comment at the end about BRICS/India/Saudi is something I have thought about a bit. I liken it to API Technology – you know, when you have two disparate systems – like an old mainframe in a datacenter somewhere, and now it has to talk to some dang new-fangled AI thing in “the cloud”? Well, you’re not going to move the mainframe, and it may be too critical/complex to replace/modernize, so you write some code elsewhere to serve as an API that permits your ancient IBM cabinet thingy talk out to modern distributed systems. Well, the US/UK/EU is like that mainframe … the emerging Global South is the future … Countries like Saudi/India/perhaps-even-Turkey are going to be your API-translator layer … ferrying all manner of things between two increasingly different and distant worlds. The “America: For Sale” tour continues. It is very sad that we have to look to Bruce Springsteen to show leadership and call out Orange Julius. https://www.politico.eu/article/corrupt-incompetent-and-treasonous-bruce-springsteen-lashes-donald-trump/ (I give Bruce credit, he’s 75 and still going. But where is AOC?) Yea, to show leadership and join “a long list of American celebrities who voiced support for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris”. It looks more like a setup for next Wrestlemania. Springsteen vs Trump, only on pay-per-view! If ratings are good enough, then plebs could get Madonna vs Melania extravaganza. If Bruce had supported Jill Stein, would he have had more credibility in your view? I get it that we’re a peak cynicism. He would have had more credibility in my view if he did what he is paid for, sing instead of talk. Same apply for most celebrites that are more than happy to be cogs in the machine (instead of raging against it). P.S. Now that I think again, those celebrites are probably paid to talk also, though not by the common people but by the machine. “Same apply for most celebrites that are more than happy to be cogs in the machine (instead of raging against it). It’s kinda funny, that phrase. Because Bruce and Tom Morello are close friends. Morello toured with them for a while.. Ghost of Tom Joad Bruce doesn’t seem to understand all those Blue collars he wrote about voted FOR Trump. And They’re not the ones who are paying $2000 per ticket to see him. “Bruce?” Springsteen is just another musician-celebrity fraud. I love the publicity shots of him and his dear friend Obama (or should I refer to him as”Barack?”) leaning against a nice old car, with the shades on. So cool, those two. The fact is, whether it’s Bono, or Springsteen, of Jimmy Fallon, the two-Party iron rule remains in place. Remember what “Barack” said: they’re playing between the 40-yard lines. And it is indeed play. I’m familiar with the “shut up and sing” argument. It has merit, however, nature abhors a vacuum. Bruce has been political for a long time, I remember him crying about George W. Bush winning in 2004 … it could be a release valve that serves the Donkeys by giving them an appearance of caring, i.e Donkey-adjacent celebs give actual politicians cover to do nothing. All publicly quoted figures of this type are kidology to some extent. Any defence package of any size is complex, staged over many years and usually includes both immediate purchases and options on future tranches. So I would not be surprised if this figure included everything from options taken up for new tranches from past contracts, new contracts for delivery over 5-10 years, options on further packages, spares, support and training packages extending over 25 years (standard for this sort of thing) and upgrades and weapon packages. Bear in mind that these days, what’s sometimes called Total Cost of Ownership or Through-Life Cost can easily be twice the initial procurement cost. The Saudis will not be greatly concerned about equipment performance as such, and anyway their attempts to use sophisticated weapons have been generally unimpressive. This package is designed to tie the US more closely to them, as has been their policy for decades, by making the US their effective defenders. The package will include lots of US personnel in-country to help with everything from training to operational planning, all of whom will be effectively hostages in the event of a crisis with, say, Iran. Think of the US, if you like, as a giant PMC, providing equipment, training, support and mercenaries to the Saudis. For this reason they are not going for Russian equipment. As you say, there would be great difficulties of integration and operation, and even such basic things as language. The Russians would never agree to the kind of massive presence in the country that really serious arms deliveries would entail, nor could they compete, frankly, with several generations of contact at all levels between US and Saudi officers, together with contacts from other western states, which have produced a military that thinks and fights like the West. I’m sure the Russians would be only too happy to undermine the US position, but this isn’t the way to do it. More widely, this is certainly a political, if not military, snub for Israel, not least because the Israelis have a history of trying to manipulate US arms sales to Saudi Arabia. I don’t think it has much to do with BRICS, which remains, as you’ve often pointed out, a vestigial entity, and one where a defence dimension may well never emerge. In the meantime, the Saudis are playing both sides against the middle, as usual. Government contracting (and accounting) is a very complicated milieu of rules/regs (FAR combined with ASBs) hidden in unnecessary complexity behind ‘security clearances’. During my own career, my ‘rise’ because of the mere questions I asked. The assumption was that I wouldn’t play ball. As I watch the front line on the various telegram/youtube channels, I am not surprised to see the live demonstrations (marketing value) of the clips. Most that I watch do not contain the bloodshed, so they are sanitized for the audience. As a former ‘customer’ (working for the contractor), I was privy to watching the demonstrations of our products in exercises mimicking war games. It was a marketing tool. Watching the next generation products used in real warfare has helped me understand, with great sadness, the smoke and mirrors we in the West project as superior technology. We are completely fake, like Hollywood. The real question for me? How long will the charade continue? Trump was the perfect selection for the neocons (and the tech titans that prepare to tighten the noose) as consummate salesmen. This is my mere opinion and I admit to that. Apologies for typos. So, the US has sold a lot of arms to Saudi Arabia. What, precisely, are the Saudis going to do with those arms? They obviously can’t attack Israel. By the time they have been trained in using the arms, the Iranians will know all about them and using them on Iran would be suicidal, and using them on Iraq would be the equivalent of using them on Iran, i.e. suicidal. Their use of arms against Yemen was notably unsuccessful. It seems to me that the US might just as well have saved diplomatic trouble by dumping all those arms in the Atlantic, for all the value they add to the US agenda. How dare you suggest that! Are you not forgetting the shareholders of the defense contractors? The CEOs and their pay packages, options and bonuses? The revolving door for the current and former Generals and assorted personnel and their ability to go into consulting work when they retire. The lobbying dollars and campaign contributions that are all piggybacked on defense spending? How selfish. LOL (Though it’s not really very funny at all) And I do agree with your comment. Saudi Arabia used those weapons in its long intervention against Yemen (from 2015 onwards). The strong involvement of specialists from the USA, the UK, and France highlighted the fact that the Saudis were not very proficient in the usage of their armament. Knew right off the bat that Trump was lying about how much these deals were worth as, like this post mentions, he did the same exact same thing a coupla years ago when he went to Saudi Arabia and announcing it, had a board or two showing images of the weapons systems that he was selling the Saudis. Only it took time to realize that a lot of this money was already backed into the cake and was part of regular deals. That mention of that Dana Stroul cause me to do a double-take. She’s a real nasty piece of work and Brian Berlectic has mentioned her several times. Here is a video of him showing who she is- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYbGLynvr4A (4:50 mins) In reference to countering bullshit: Eisenhower’s speech nailed it that, “…an alert and knowledgeable citizenry…” is a prerequisite. Our attention span is conditioned by media to validate Occam’s Razor. News-as-entertainment replaced journalism; journalists replaced with Communications Degrees in Mastering Being On TV. The underlying Financial Times article, “What Has Musk’s DOGE Actually Accomplished?,” comes off as the approved analysis of the Uniparty Daily Truth. Much of the color commentary is from rightwingers, who are miffed because DOGE blew their cover. DOGE stepped in it quickly, when they themselves would have been a tad more daintily patient in destroying the social state, or what is left of it , in the U S of A. Quotes from our betters: ‘Calkins, the government contractor (sheesh): “Of all the things you could do to affect the government, it would have been better to go after regulation. It would have been better to go after entitlements. Just blowing up jobs was a good way to make enemies, a good way to cause more disruption than progress.” [Translation: Better office politics, please!] ‘“I think that some people, particularly on the right, felt that maybe Doge would be just kind of a catch-all solution,” says Cato’s Dominik Lett. [Meaning that he wanted DOGE to wreck the agencies so that his peeps won’t have to lift a finger.] ‘But [Lett] adds that “if you want to reassure bond markets, if you want to put the budget on a sustainable path, you need to make spending reductions to Medicare, Medicaid and social security. And for the administration, Doge was never really intended to make significant benefit reductions to those programmes.”’ Then there’s this mindless drivel from on high: ‘Safra Catz, the chief executive of software group Oracle — whose founder Larry Ellison has been a Trump ally — Doge was simply the long overdue introduction of a business mindset to government. “Don’t use things from years ago just because you have always been using them,” she says of the initiative’s approach.’ Catz undoubtedly isn’t aware of the old business axiom: If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. I guess that she’s having some problems with her business mindset. Social Security is much on the minds of our betters, as we see, yet Social Security is lean and efficient. The superiors are in a snit because one more manufactured crisis hasn’t done in Social Security. Meanwhile, I note today’s posting here at Naked Capitalism about United Health Care. Financial Times starts off with vox pop: People think that the government is wasteful. Ergo, natch, DOGE. Vox populi, vox dei, vox Silicon Valley. Yet: People know that U.S. health-insurance is a scam and a swamp. Do I see squads of unnamed jamokes showing up to diddle the software of health insurers suspected of gaming the system? Heck, I’m such a naïf. And the upright citizens wonder about the emergence of Saint Luigi Mangione. KSA has been a large user of US high tech gear: E-3 AWACS squadron, F-15 several squadrons, An extensive ground to air surveillance sensor network, Bradleys….. These systems are 40 years old or more. One thing the KSA does not do is logistics support of these systems and in some it needs US techs to operate them…. A lot of so called arms deals include a large part, maybe 70% of the buy price, as logistics support. That said some of the buys systems are not ordered. IIRC the earlier Trump 45 deal included a number of THAAD “batteries”, that to my knowledge were not ordered, even if the US could open the lines to make more. Likely the Saudis are implying they put the money as a wedge in a 10 year plan, starting sometime soon. “John Helmer has said that the Russians have realized they are negotiating with a cult of personality and have been proceeding accordingly.” They remember another cult of personality, namely Stalin. And one wonders if his purges are inspired by Stalin. Someone said that wIth Stalin there was a cult of personality, and also a personality behind it. Don’t forget Jared who also has a company trying to make deals with Arab nations and who apparently seeded the Riviera idea in Trump’s noggin. Meanwhile the Adelson payoff in favor of Israel is fading since Trump can’t run again however much bs he spouts on that topic. Perhaps we’ll have world peace if every country has a Trump resort complex. The Man Who Would Be King needs robes and a camel. He has appetittes and visions of sugarplums and sweetmeats, but….Correct me if I am wrong; 1) isn’t the US on somewhat short supply of military equipment that actually works ( refer to war in Ukraine), 2) Doesn’t all that military equipment require refined rare earth minerals which may be hard to obtain from the Chinese peasants; 3) Mastery of aviation products doesn’t seem to be a DOD forte: three carrier planes lost to the Houthis, a F-35 almost downed, a dozen drones -by-bye the acquisition of a jumbo jet without a plan or budget to retrofit ( and has Boeing changed their management team?) , and now Trump has an aeronautical engineering degree to design combat aircraft. I am soooo..tired of all this winning. I wonder about the claims of such a major group of arms sales. Knowing its hard to ever see if it happens there is one way to watch over time. All major arms sales both Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) have to be notified to congress under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations 22 CFR Part 120-130. The notifications do eventually appear in a couple of places. The Federal Register being the major source, but DDTC publishes DCS sales in News and Events here: https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/ddtc_public/ddtc_public?id=ddtc_public_portal_news_and_events&cat=Report Foreign Military Sales are available here, it is not a goverment website but has some interesting information. https://www.forumarmstrade.org/major-arms-sales-notifications-tracker.html One thing to think about is year over year sales of weapon systems, I usually do a rough percentage of the export of “weapons” from the U.S. including both FMS and DCS sales and generally it is only about 3% of all exports. The Military Industrial Complex hits way above its weight, and arms sales garner a lot of attention but are really not big drivers of export volume. There are big sales from time to time but not every year. e.g. JSF. The kinds of weapon sales it takes to get to the $ 142 B level is years countries don’t buy major weapon systems on impulse and they normally take many years to deliver.

Title: Amazon layoffs: 100 jobs cut from teams serving Alexa and Kindle in corporate trim

Amazon layoffs: E-commerce giant Amazon is cutting around 100 jobs in its devices and services division, which includers workers involved with the Alexa voice assistance and e-reader product Kindle, according to a report by Bloomberg. This moves comes as the company makes effort to “trim” its corporate workforce, it added. In a statement on May 14, Kristy Schmidt, spokeswoman for Amazon confirmed the layoffs and said that it is a part of the company's effort to “operate more efficiently” “As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently, and to better align with our product road map, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles. We don’t make these decisions lightly, and we’re committed to supporting affected employees through their transitions,” Schmidt added. Since 2022, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has begun the Seattle-based online retailer’s biggest-ever round of corporate job cuts. And as many as 27,000 workers were given the pink slip. Since then, several smaller rounds of layoffs in particular departments have led to job cuts across the company's various department, including some cuts in the communication division in January 2025. Till March 2025, Amazon had 1.56 million workers — the number include those on the rolls in full-time and part-time jobs. This is up 3 per cent comapred to 2024. However, the e-commerce giant’s workforce is mostly made up of hourly wage earners or logistics employees in its warehouse and delivery network. The job cuts at Amazon’s devices team were reported earlier by Reuters. This development comes after Microsoft Corporation on May 13 (Tuesday) also confirmed that it is cutting 6,000 jobs across departments in a bid to “reduce management layers”, the BB report added.

Dubbed the Trillion Dollar Security Initiative, the foundation hopes to make Ethereum robust enough that billions of people could confidently hold over $1,000 onchain. It's also eyeing participation from companies, institutions, or governments who could be "comfortable storing more than 1 trillion dollars of value inside a single contract or application." The initiative will unfold in three phases, starting with a comprehensive assessment of Ethereum’s security across areas such as wallet UX, smart contract tooling, and consensus protocol. The next phase will focus on implementing key improvements, followed by efforts to better communicate Ethereum’s security standards. The Foundation is also soliciting input from users, developers, and institutions to help shape the roadmap. Security luminaries, including research-driven crypto investment firm Paradigm's Samczsun, blockchain security and research firm Sigma Prime co-founder Mehdi Zerouali, and Etherealize co-founder Zach Obront, are set to lead efforts for the new initiative. The Ethereum Foundation said it welcomes community input to ensure diverse views shape its infrastructure development. Ethereum Foundation's protocol security lead, Fredrik Svantes, and Josh Stark from its management team will oversee and co-chair the project. The announcement of the three-phase program comes a week after the rollout of Pectra, sending Ethereum to double-digit highs and sparking renewed interest. Following the upgrade, it became "hard to justify ETH as a relative underperformer," analysts from investment firm Bernstein said last week. But despite the network's latest achievements, Ethereum needs to "keep up with Layer 2 growth," Ulyana Skladchikova, head of product at open-source explorer Blockscout, told Decrypt last week. Layer 2 networks are separate blockchains built on top of Ethereum, which can keep up by upgrading how they handle transactions using the former, making it cheaper and faster by using "blobs" that enhance how data is stored and processed. At the user experience level, Ethereum also needs to enhance "granular control" of its security. "By reducing the need to set up, interact with, and move assets to a smart contract wallet," other use cases could become more viable with Pectra and provide "additional security and flexibility," Skladchikova explained. On the institutional side, Ethereum has also been feeling the pinch among investors, data from CoinGlass shows. Ethereum ETFs have witnessed just three days of positive net inflows in the week since Pectra, driven primarily by BlackRock and Grayscale. Decrypt reached out to the Ethereum Foundation for comment.

Title: Amazon Cuts 100 Jobs in Devices Unit Amid Ongoing Efficiency Drive

Time Published: 2025-05-15T00:56:08Z

Amazon reportedly cut about 100 jobs in its devices and services unit, saying it did so as part of a regular business review. The layoffs amount to a small portion of the unit’s total workforce, Reuters reported Wednesday (May 14), citing a company spokesperson. “As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently, and to better align with our product roadmap, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles,” the spokesperson said, according to the report. Amazon’s devices and services unit is responsible for the Kindle eReader, Echo smart home devices, Alexa voice assistant and Zoox robotaxi, the report said. The spokesperson did not say which divisions saw layoffs, it added. Bloomberg also reported on the job cuts Wednesday, noting that Amazon has made several rounds of layoffs targeting specific departments and the company has about 1.56 million full– and part-time employees. In January, Amazon laid off dozens of people in its communications department. A company spokesperson said at the time that the changes were made after a review “to help us move faster, increase ownership, strengthen our culture, and brings teams closer to customers.” It was reported at the time that Amazon has cut tens of thousands of corporate jobs since Andy Jassy became the company’s CEO in 2021. These include 27,000 positions eliminated in corporate job cuts that began in 2022, as well as smaller numbers of layoffs in a series of smaller rounds focused on particular departments and roles. When announcing in January 2023 that Amazon planned to lay off more than 18,000 workers, Jassy said the economy was uncertain, the company had hired rapidly for several years, and leaders across the company were prioritizing the things that matter most to customers and the long-term health of the business. In September, Jassy said Amazon planned to reduce the number of managers in each of its organizations and require employees to work primarily in an office. “If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations’ ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day,” Jassy said.

Title: Bitwise CIO expects surge in crypto ETP allocations by year-end, foresees 5% portfolio norm

Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan foresees a trillion-dollar future for crypto ETPs as institutional interest rises and allocations climb. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan said on May 14 that a “big unlock” is occurring across the financial advisory space regarding crypto investments. After attending a major advisory firm’s conference, Hougan shared his expectations that most major firms will enable crypto exchange-traded product (ETP) access by the end of 2025. He added that interest in crypto exposure is intensifying and predicted that the new measure for inflows into crypto ETPs will be “many billions.” After over one year since their launch, collective daily inflows for US-traded crypto ETPs have surpassed $1 billion in five instances so far, according to Farside Investors data. Hougan also said that portfolio allocation norms for crypto are shifting and “5% is the new 1%.” He further explained that institutions are becoming more comfortable with higher crypto weightings in traditional portfolios. Asset managers have historically advocated modest crypto allocations, citing volatility and risk concentration. In December, BlackRock’s Investment Institute defined a 1% to 2% Bitcoin allocation as a “reasonable range” for multi-asset portfolios. That recommendation has since translated into practice. BlackRock incorporated Bitcoin (BTC) into its $150 billion model portfolio offerings via the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), assigning a 1% to 2% weight in target allocations. The launch of US spot Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) ETPs in 2024 provided regulatory-compliant exposure mechanisms at scale for institutional clients, prompting many advisors to reevaluate their crypto positioning. Hougan also reported increased advisor inquiries about Ethereum, stating he fielded more questions on the asset “in the past few days than the past six months.” While Bitcoin remains the dominant product by scale, Ethereum has emerged as a key area of curiosity for professionals, according to Hougan. Bitwise shared in April that US spot Bitcoin ETPs held $93.2 billion in assets under management (AUM) as of December 2024, contrasting with spot Ethereum ETPs that totaled $6.3 billion in AUM. Despite the disparity, ownership of both products is dispersed across key institutional categories. In Bitcoin ETPs, hedge funds (36.97%) and investment advisors (33.11%) account for most institutional ownership. On the other hand, Ethereum ETPs show more balanced exposure between investment advisors (29.79%), brokerages (25.25%), and hedge funds (24.74%), while family offices show a stronger preference for Ethereum. Investment advisors and hedge funds allocated 5.8% and 4.5% of their total crypto allocation to Ethereum, while family offices had 25% of their nearly $173 million crypto allocation targeted to Ethereum. Hougan’s remarks reinforce industry expectations that professional investment access to crypto is entering a new maturity phase. As product availability widens and allocation norms shift upward, crypto may play a more regularized role in portfolio construction.

Title: Banks Exploring Stablecoin Amid Fears of Losing Market Share, BitGo Executive Says

As the stablecoin competition is heating up with looming regulation in the U.S., traditional finance institutions are taking notice—largely out of fear of losing out to digital dollars, said Ben Reynolds, BitGo's managing director of stablecoins, at Consensus 2025 in Toronto. Speaking at a panel discussion, he said that BitGo's recently launched stablecoin-as-a-service has seen “incredible inbound” interest from U.S. and foreign banks wanting to tokenize deposits or issue stablecoins. "A lot of banks are just being defensive—they’re afraid they’re going to lose their deposits,” Reynolds said. "They look at stablecoins and say: How do we not get left behind?" Yield-bearing versions of stablecoins and tokenized money market funds have seen rapid growth recently, but still make up only a fraction of the $230 billion stablecoin market. A16z’s Sam Broner said that while yield-bearing stablecoins are a promising market segment, their primary use case is for payments and transactions where users don't really care about yields. Still, a near-term killer use case could be “collateral mobility”—the ability to instantly move money to meet obligations across different platforms. "You can’t do a lot of things with a share of a money market fund," Broner said. "You’ve got lock-up periods, business-hour settlement, and contracts that have to be manually reviewed. Crypto gives you programmatic, permissionless flexibility." Yield-bearing stablecoins could also be attractive for institutions, said Matt Kunke, crypto product strategist at BlackRock. "If you're a DAO, protocol, or market maker, moving between crypto holdings on an exchange and your brokerage account is slow and full of friction," he said. "Stablecoins that carry yield just reduce that drag.” However, regulatory distinctions will shape the market. “A tokenized Treasury fund is a security, and an actual stablecoin is not,” he explained. “They deserve fundamentally different markets." Joseph Saldana, chief financial officer of the Wyoming Stable Token Commission, pointed out that yield–generating tokens have the power to broaden investors' access compared to mutual funds that often have minimum limits of investment that "lock out a lot of people." "We want to service the underbanked and give broader access to instruments the rest of us enjoy every day," Saldana said.

Interestingly, the news comes just weeks after the tech giant posted strong financial results. A company spokesperson stated that the planned job cuts are not related to performance, but are instead aimed at reducing layers of management. In the last few years or so, we have witnessed Microsoft laying off thousands of its employees. Back in 2023, the Redmond giant announced significant job cuts, affecting 10,000 employees. Microsoft then said it was a strategic decision to immunize itself from global changes. Fast forward to September of last year, the company fired 650 employees as part of Xbox job cuts. Now, a new round of layoffs is knocking on the doors, as Microsoft has announced its plan to lay off 3% of its total employees. If we go by the number, the planned layoffs will affect at least 6,000 Microsoft employees. The layoffs will affect employees across all levels, teams, and geographies. This year, Microsoft has announced job cuts for the second time. In January, the company fired a small number of employees based on performance reviews. However, this time it’s not related to performance. In a statement to CNBC, Microsoft’s spokesperson said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” Microsoft’s spokesperson also told the news agency that one objective of the new round of layoffs is to reduce layers of management. It’s worth noting that Microsoft is funneling billions of dollars into its AI infrastructure. While it’s unclear, it could be one of the biggest reasons behind the new round of layoffs announced by Microsoft. Not to forget, the company is also actively renegotiating its partnership with OpenAI for IPO and funding. Interestingly, the new round of layoffs comes as the company posted a strong earnings report last month. The tech giant reported $70.1 billion in revenue and an 18 percent spike in profits for the January-March period. The company’s cloud computing and artificial intelligence business helped it beat Wall Street expectations. Earlier this year, Amazon also announced job cuts to reduce “unnecessary layers” in its organization. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

In an interview with Decrypt, the famed computer scientist and Blocksteam CEO said that given all the institutional money flowing into the space, the price of the biggest and oldest cryptocurrency should be higher. Bitcoin was recently trading for $103,300 per coin—unmoved in the past day but up more than 7% over the past week, according to crypto markets data provider CoinGecko. It is off just 5% from its all-time high near $109,000, despite a late winter, early spring swoon. Back, who holds a computer science doctorate in distributed systems from Exeter University and has long been involved in cryptography, told Decrypt: "I'm thinking this cycle could get quite high, but the cycle stretches out a few years, right? So I was thinking $500,000 to $1 million, because there's a lot going on." He added: "There doesn't seem to be a clear logical reason to me for why we are only at $100,000. That's not very high given all of the things that are different compared to a couple years ago." Back noted the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., which have generated more than $41 billion in net inflows, and the crypto-friendly policies of U.S. President Trump. Wall Street's top regulator, the SEC, last year approved Bitcoin ETFs—funds managed by the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity—which give investors easy access to BTC with shares that can be bought via brokerage accounts. The approval of the funds has led to a flow of new money into the space from investors previously locked out of the crypto investing sphere. Bitcoin's latest record—hit in January—isn't that high compared to previous cycles when looking at the coin's movement following its historical halving events. BTC tends to move in four-year cycles. But Back said that he thought brokers and individual investors tend to buy things that have already risen, so more money will flow into the space as Bitcoin climbs, creating price momentum. "I think if you get a new all-time high, it could quickly become a lot higher," he said. Back is the co-founder and CEO of Blocksteam, a company building Bitcoin infrastructure, like crypto wallets. Back had an email exchange with Bitcoin's mysterious creator—or creators—Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, the year that the original paper outlining the blockchain network was published. Bitcoin's mining process is derived from Hashcash, a proof-of-work system that Back invented.

Title: Trump gets a jet. But it’s what he’s giving in return that should have Americans worried.

Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows By Chris Hayes This is an adapted excerpt from the May 13 episode of “All In with Chris Hayes.” For decades, going back to Ronald Reagan, when an American president makes their first visit to a foreign nation, they almost always go to Canada. It makes sense: They’re our top trading partner; we share a language and a very long border. But in 2017, Donald Trump did not do that. Instead, Trump went to the oil-rich kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where he joined in laying hands on a glowing orb. During that trip, he also forged a close friendship with the nation’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who would later invest $2 billion in a business owned by Trump’s son-in-law, against the advice of his own economic experts. It’s worth noting that before that announcement, Syria’s leader offered to build a Trump Tower in Damascus. Eight years later, Trump is president again. This time around, Trump, once again, decided he wasn’t going to Canada, the country he openly wants to annex. Instead, the president went back to the Middle East, landing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday, with plans to visit Qatar and the United Arab Emirates next. The Saudis, the Qataris and the Emiratis all clearly understood the assignment. Take the crown prince: He greeted Trump on the tarmac and rolled out the royal purple carpet. Not only did the Saudis welcome Trump with open arms, but they also welcomed his co-president, Elon Musk. However, Musk wasn’t the only billionaire on the trip. Trump and the crown prince joined forces to open a U.S.-Saudi investment forum for big-money players from the two nations, with speakers from U.S. firms like Citigroup, BlackRock and Palantir. The White House claims Trump “secured $600 billion in deals with the Saudi government and firms.” But, according to The New York Times, “the details the White House provided were vague and totaled less than half that number. And a closer look at the projects the administration provided shows several were already in the works before Mr. Trump took office.” But Trump claimed a big win, and so the president responsible for the “Muslim ban” posed onstage in front of a massive Saudi flag and was applauded. Trump had some other big gifts ready, too. The president announced a $142 billion arms agreement to provide the Saudis with U.S. weapons and defense contractors to maintain them. He also announced that he plans to lift sanctions on Syria, which Trump said was at the behest of the Saudis. “Oh, what I do for the crown prince,” he said from the stage. While that announcement was a good one and those sanctions on Syria should be dropped, we should not drop them as a favor to the Saudi crown prince who threw $2 billion at your son-in-law. It’s also worth noting that before that announcement, Syria’s leader offered to build a Trump Tower in Damascus and said he would give the U.S. mineral rights contracts in his country, according to several sources familiar with the efforts who spoke with Reuters. Mideast diplomacy is one of the most complicated, fraught areas of American foreign policy, and out of the gate, Trump is basically just going down a list of policies that the Saudis and their allies wanted. Policywise, some of those concessions are better than others; corrupt processes can sometimes accidentally create a decent policy here and there. But they’re not policies so much as presents for his overseas buddies, and, in return, those buddies are giving him what he wants. Which brings us, of course, to the Qatari jumbo jet. A special Boeing 747 that has been called a “palace of the sky” and a “flying mansion.” A luxury item worth $400 million and gifted to Trump by the Qatari royal family over the weekend. It is full of leather, gold and burl wood accents. It sports at least three lounges, two bedrooms, nine bathrooms, five galleys and a private office. Trump is palpably stoked out of his shoes about this thing, like a very rich kid on Christmas morning getting the world’s most expensive toy. Accepting this jet would be the most shockingly corrupt act by a president in the history of the presidency. It violates not only the spirit of the Constitution, but literally the text. However, according to Trump, not taking it would be “stupid.” It seems the only thing that unites the policies Trump has announced on his Middle East tour so far is that they are exactly what the Gulf states wanted. The Gulf states don’t have huge armies, but they have a lot of oil and a lot of money, and they use it to extend their geopolitical dominance. It makes sense, this is the place Trump feels most at home because these countries get Trump in a way they never got any other American president. That’s because this American president openly admires despots and envies what they have. The Gulf states that are hosting Trump understand that. They recognize he is not there for 330 million Americans. He is there for himself, and they are there to indulge him. It’s not because Trump is a unique force of nature. He is not special; he is just easy. He’s not even the first foreign leader to be gifted a 747 by the Qataris. Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan got a half-billion-dollar jumbo jet back in 2018. But this is the thing: The Gulf states have been doing this forever. They don’t have huge armies, but they have a lot of oil and a lot of money, and they use it to extend their geopolitical dominance. That only goes so far with a traditional, law-abiding American administration. However, with Trump, a man not just willing but thirsty to trade on the trappings of the office that American voters bestowed on him, the sky is the limit.

Title: 5 new Uber features you should know — including a way to avoid surge pricing

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Uber is giving commuters new ways to travel and cut costs on frequent rides. The ride-hailing company on Wednesday announced a route share feature on its platform, prepaid ride passes and special deals week for Uber One members at its annual Go-Get showcase. Uber’s new features come as the company accelerates its leadership position in the ride-sharing market and seeks to offer more affordable alternatives for users. It also follows last week’s first-quarter earnings as Uber swung to a profit but fell short of revenue estimates. “The goal for us as we build our products is to put people at the center of everything, and right now for us, it means making things a little easier, a little more predictable, and above all, just a little more — or a lot more — affordable,” said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi at the event. Here are some of the big announcements from the annual product event. Users looking to save money on regular routes and willing to walk a short distance can select a shared ride with up to two other passengers through the new route-share feature. The prepopulated routes run every 20 minutes along busy areas between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. on weekdays. The initial program is slated to kick off in seven cities, including New York, San Francisco, Boston and Chicago. Uber said its new route-share fares will cost up to 50% less than an UberX option, and that it is working to partner with employers on qualifying the feature for commuter benefits. Users can book a seat from 7 days to 10 minutes before a pickup departure. Riders on Uber can now prepurchase two different types of ride passes to hold fares on frequented routes during a one-hour period every day. For $2.99 a month, riders can buy a price lock pass that holds a price between two locations for one hour every day. The pass expires after 30 days or a savings total of $50. The feature gives riders a way to avoid surge pricing. Ride Passes roll out in 10 cities on Wednesday, including Dallas, Orlando and San Francisco, and can be purchased for up to 10 routes a month. Uber will charge users a lower price if the fare is cheaper than the pass at departure time. The company also debuted a prepaid pass option, allowing users to pay in advance and stock up on regular monthly trips. Uber’s pass option comes in bundles of 5, 10, 15 and 20-ride increments, with corresponding discounts between 5% and 20%. Both pass options will be available on teen accounts in the fall, Uber said. The route share and ride passes will be available in a new commuter hub feature on the app coming later this year. Uber is also expanding its autonomous vehicle partnership with Volkswagen. The company will start testing shared AV rides later this year and is aiming for a launch in Los Angeles in 2026. Uber rolled out autonomous rides in Austin, Texas, in March through its agreement with Alphabet-owned Waymo and is preparing for an Atlanta launch this summer. The company announced the partnership in May 2023. Autonomous Waymo rides are also currently offered through the Uber app in Phoenix, but the company does not directly manage that fleet. Khosrowshahi called AVs “the single greatest opportunity ahead for Uber” during the company’s earnings call last week and said the Austin debut “exceeded” expectations. The company previously had an AV unit that it sold in 2020 as it faced high costs and a series of safety challenges, including a fatal accident. Along with Volkswagen and Waymo, Uber has joined forces with Avride, May Mobility and self-driving trucking company Aurora for autonomous ride-sharing and freight services in the U.S. The company has partnerships with WeRide, Pony.AI and Momenta internationally. Uber is taking a page out of Amazon’s book by offering its own variation of the e-commerce giant’s beloved Prime Day, with special offers between May 16 and 23 for Uber One members. Some of those deals include 50% off shared rides and 20% off Uber Black. The platform is also adding a new benefit of 10% back in Uber credits for users that use Uber Rent or book Lime rides. UberEats also announced a partnership with OpenTable to allow users to book reservations and rides. The new feature, powered by OpenTable, launches in six countries including the U.S. and Australia. Through the partnership, users can book restaurant reservations and get a discount on rides. OpenTable members will also be able to transfer points to Uber and UberEats. The company is also offering OpenTable VIPs a six-month free trial of Uber One. Samantha Subin is a digital news associate with CNBC. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Quantum Threat? BlackRock Flags Future Risk In Bitcoin ETF Filing

Time Published: 2025-05-14T15:00:28Z

BlackRock has added a warning about quantum computing to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing. Based on reports, the asset manager sees a future risk that ultra-powerful machines might crack the math securing Bitcoin. This is the first time BlackRock has flagged this concern in its spot Bitcoin ETF paperwork. According to the updated regulatory filing on May 9, BlackRock now lists “quantum computing” among possible threats to its Bitcoin ETF. The trust holds about $64 billion in net assets, making it the largest spot Bitcoin fund on record. Company lawyers say that if quantum processors become strong enough, they could decrypt private keys and put wallet security in jeopardy. It’s a standard move in ETF filings to note every conceivable risk, even if it feels far-off. Based on reports, worries kicked up last December when Google unveiled Willow, a chip claimed to solve certain tasks in minutes that would take today’s supercomputers 10 septillion years. A few months later, Microsoft introduced Majorana 1 to tackle long-standing scaling hurdles. Those announcements set off alarm bells in the crypto world. In theory, a quantum device running Shor’s algorithm could factor the large numbers behind Bitcoin’s elliptic-curve signatures. In practice, we’re still in the early, error-prone “NISQ” era, so real attacks remain at least years away. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, surfaced another angle in February. He suggested that once quantum hackers can break old private keys, they might recover Bitcoin from the roughly 3.7 million coins considered lost forever. Ardoino stressed that quantum machines are still distant from cracking 256-bit security, so no coins will reappear anytime soon. Crypto analyst Willy Woo jumped in, asking whether Google, a government agency, or a new startup would be first to seize those dormant assets. He figures the $350 billion in lost coins could spur fresh quantum investment if those keys ever become vulnerable. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs have pulled in more cash than ever. Data from Farside Investors shows over $41 billion in net inflows since these funds launched in January. On May 8, weekly ETF inflows topped the previous all-time high of $40 billion. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas called lifetime net flows “the hardest metric to grow,” yet ETFs raced to new highs despite recent market jitters. Investors appear focused on price moves today, not on the quantum questions of tomorrow. In the months ahead, crypto developers and standards groups will work on “post-quantum” signature schemes. If they stay on schedule, Bitcoin networks could adopt new, quantum-resistant algorithms long before any real threat appears. For now, the market’s heavy inflows suggest that mainstream buyers aren’t yet spooked by next-generation computing power.

Title: China Market Update: Tencent’s Terrific Q1 Earnings
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brendanahern/2025/05/14/china-market-update-tencents-terrific-q1-earnings/

ByBrendan Ahern ByBrendan Ahern, Senior Contributor. CLN Tencent (700 HK) reported Q1 financial results after the Hong Kong close today that beat analyst expectations on the big three: revenue, adjusted net income, and adjusted EPS. Unfortunately, due to a flight, I wasn’t able to catch the earnings call. Looks like a solid beat! Party on, Garth! Party on, Wayne! Asian equities had a strong session, led by Hong Kong, Indonesia, Vietnam, Taiwan, and South Korea. There was considerable market chatter about the strength of the Chinese yuan (CNY) versus the US dollar, possibly driven by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), which runs counter to the prevailing narrative. Regulators intervened to prevent “industry chaos” caused by “vicious competition” following JD.com’s entry into the food delivery business with significant subsidies, which threaten Meituan’s core business. This echoes previous episodes of aggressive competition in sectors such as solar, ride hailing (Uber versus DiDi), and, more recently, electric vehicles and hybrids, which have benefited consumers but negatively impacted company balance sheets. Regulators summoned JD.com and Meituan to ensure compliance with laws, emphasizing their focus on “curbing low-price competition and homogenized competition.” They stated JD.com’s entry should “avoid touching the regulatory red line” regarding subsidies and commission policies. JD.com rose 3.36% after posting better-than-expected first quarter results, while Meituan gained 1.46%, as regulatory scrutiny could benefit its position. Insurance and brokerage/capital markets stocks had an exceptional day on speculation that onshore mutual funds may become buyers due to their current underweight positions. Shipping companies also performed well, buoyed by positive developments in US-China trade talks and the launch of a 90-day truce. Hong Kong saw strong trading volumes and broad market participation, led by growth stocks, even as financials outperformed. Mainland investors were net buyers via Southbound Stock Connect, though several growth stocks were net sells, likely as a funding source for the upcoming CATL Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO). Mainland China’s markets were more mixed compared to Hong Kong. April aggregate financing year-to-date was RMB 16.43 trillion, just below expectations of RMB 16.577 trillion and up from March’s RMB 15.18 trillion. New loans year-to-date reached RMB 10.06 trillion, below expectations of RMB 10.474 trillion and up from March’s RMB 9.78 trillion. Alibaba Group, NetEase, and KE Holdings are scheduled to report results tomorrow. Index Changes and Market Structure My favorite investment book? Without question, it is the MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes Methodology. Those 207 pages dictate the allocation of USD 16.3 trillion in active and passive assets. MSCI released its pro-forma for the end of the month: the United States’ weight in the index has declined to 61.7% from 63.7% at the end of April and from 66% just a few months ago. China’s market share within emerging markets has increased to 29.8%, although 17 companies will be deleted versus 6 additions, bringing China’s numerical weight to 47% (568 of 1,206 emerging market stocks). Remember, MSCI limits Mainland-listed Chinese stocks to only 20% of their potential index weight. India’s rise continues, but its size and scale remain relatively small compared to China, at 19.4% of the emerging markets index with 157 stocks. If US-China trade talks progress positively, could an easing of the geopolitical narrative prompt MSCI to resume China A-share inclusion? Currently, Chinese A shares represent only 20% of their potential market capitalization in indices; full inclusion would significantly increase China’s weight, likely approaching 50% of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. While it is early days, the market may be underestimating how a trade deal could lead to President Trump sidelining China hawks within the GOP. Would Trump allow American Depositary Receipt (ADR) delisting to jeopardize a major trade deal? I doubt it. Again, it is early, but something to consider. What is your favorite investment book?

Title: Musk Adviser May Make as Much as $1 Million a Year While Helping to Dismantle Agency that Regulates Tesla and X

Investigative Journalism in the Public Interest ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published. One of Elon Musk’s employees is earning between $100,001 and $1 million annually as a political adviser to his billionaire boss while simultaneously helping to dismantle the federal agency that regulates two of Musk’s biggest companies, according to court records and a financial disclosure report obtained by ProPublica. Ethics experts said Christopher Young’s dual role — working for a Musk company as well as the Department of Government Efficiency — likely violates federal conflict-of-interest regulations. Musk has publicly called for the elimination of the agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, arguing that it is “duplicative.’’ Government ethics rules bar employees from doing anything that “would cause a reasonable person to question their impartiality” and are designed to prevent even the appearance of using public office for private gain. Court records show Young, who works for a Musk company called Europa 100 LLC, was involved in the Trump administration’s efforts to unwind the consumer agency’s operations and fire most of its staff in early February. Young’s arrangement raises questions of where his loyalty lies, experts said. The dynamic is especially concerning, they said, given that the CFPB — which regulates companies that provide financial services — has jurisdiction over Musk’s electric car company, Tesla, which makes auto loans, and his social media site, X, which announced in January that it was partnering with Visa on mobile payments. The world’s richest man has in turn made no secret of his desire to do away with the bureau, posting just weeks after Donald Trump’s election victory, “Delete CFPB. There are too many duplicative regulatory agencies.” “Musk clearly has a conflict of interest and should recuse,” said Claire Finkelstein, who directs the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law at the University of Pennsylvania. “And therefore an employee of his, who is answerable to him on the personal side, outside of government, and who stands to keep his job only if he supports Musk’s personal interests, should not be working for DOGE.” Young, a 36-year-old Republican consultant, has been active in political circles for years, most recently serving as the campaign treasurer of Musk’s political action committee, helping the tech titan spend more than a quarter billion dollars to help elect Trump. Before joining Musk’s payroll, he worked as a vice president for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the trade association representing the pharmaceutical industry’s interests, his disclosure shows. He also worked as a field organizer for the Republican National Committee and for former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, the New York Times reported. Young was appointed a special governmental employee in the U.S. Office of Personnel Management on Jan. 30 and dispatched to work in the CFPB in early February, according to court records and his disclosure form. Someone with his position could be making as much as $190,000 a year in government salary, documents obtained by Bloomberg show. At the same time, Young collects a salary as an employee of Musk’s Texas-based Europa 100 LLC, where, according to his disclosure report, his duties are to “advise political and public policy.” Beyond that description, it’s not clear what, exactly, Young does at Europa 100 or what the company’s activities are. It was created in July 2020 by Jared Birchall, a former banker who runs Musk’s family office, Excession LLC, according to state records. The company has been used to pay nannies to at least some of Musk’s children, according to a 2023 tabloid report, and, along with two other Musk entities, to facilitate tens of millions of dollars in campaign transactions, campaign finance reports show. As a special government employee, Young can maintain outside employment while serving for a limited amount of time. But such government workers are still required to abide by laws and rules governing conflicts of interest and personal and business relationships. Cynthia Brown, the senior ethics counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which has sued the administration to produce a range of public records documenting DOGE’s activities, said that Young’s government work appears to benefit his private sector employer. “Which hat are you wearing while you’re serving the American people? Are you doing it for the interests of your outside job?” she asked. In addition to his role at Europa 100, Young reported other ties to Musk’s private businesses. He affirmed in his disclosure form that he will “continue to participate” in a “defined contribution plan” sponsored by Excession, the Musk home office, and that he has served since February as a “vice president” of United States of America Inc., another Musk entity organized by Birchall, where he also advises on “political and public policy,” the records show. While he lists the latter among “sources of compensation exceeding $5,000 in a year,” the exact figure is not disclosed. Young did not return a call and emails seeking comment. The CFPB, DOGE and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. Musk didn’t respond to an email seeking comment, and Birchall didn’t return a call left at a number he lists in public formation records. A lawyer who helped form United States of America Inc. hung up when reached for comment and hasn’t responded to a subsequent message. Asked about how his business interests and government work may intersect, Musk said in a February interview that, “I’ll recuse myself if it is a conflict.” The revelation of Young’s apparent violation of federal standards of conduct follows a series of ProPublica stories documenting how another DOGE aide helped carry out the administration’s attempts to implement mass layoffs at the CFPB while holding as much as $715,000 in stock that bureau employees are prohibited from owning — actions one expert called a “pretty clear-cut violation” of the federal criminal conflict-of-interest statute. The White House has defended the aide, saying he “did not even manage” the layoffs, “making this entire narrative an outright lie.” A spokesperson also said the aide had until May 8 to divest, though it isn’t clear whether he did and the White House hasn’t answered questions about that. “These allegations are another attempt to diminish DOGE’s critical mission,” the White House said. Following ProPublica’s reporting, the aide’s work at the CFPB ended. On Monday, a group of 10 good government and consumer advocacy groups, citing ProPublica’s coverage, sent a letter to the acting inspector general of the CFPB, asking him to “swiftly investigate these clear conflicts of interest violations of Trump Administration officials acting in their own personal financial interest.” ProPublica has identified nearly 90 officials assigned to DOGE, though it’s unclear how many, if any, have potential conflicts. Government agencies have been slow to release financial disclosure forms. But Finkelstein said the cases reported by ProPublica call into question the motivation behind DOGE’s efforts to undo the consumer watchdog agency. “It matters because it means that the officials who work for the government, who are supposed to be dedicated to the interests of the American people, are not necessarily focused on the good of the country but instead may be focused on the good of themselves, self enrichment, or trying to please their boss by focusing on enriching their bosses and growing their portfolios,” she said. Unionized CFPB workers have sued the CFPB’s acting director, Russell Vought, to stop his attempts to drastically scale down the bureau’s staff and its operations. Since taking office, the Trump administration has twice attempted to fire nearly all of the agency’s employees, tried canceling nearly all of its contracts and instituted stop-work mandates that have stifled virtually all agency work, including investigations into companies, ProPublica previously reported. The parties will appear before an appeals court this Friday for oral arguments in a case that will determine just how deeply Vought can cut the agency while still ensuring that it carries out dozens of mandates Congress tasked it with when lawmakers established the bureau in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The court records produced in the litigation offer a window into the role Young played in gutting the CFPB during the administration’s first attempt to unwind the bureau beginning in early February. He was dispatched to the CFPB’s headquarters on Feb. 6, just two days after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, then the agency’s acting director, told the staff and contractors to stop working. The following day, Young and other DOGE aides were given access to nonclassified CFPB systems, court records show. That same day, Musk posted “CFPB RIP” with a gravestone emoji. On Feb. 11 and 12, Young was included on emails with top agency officials. One of those messages discussed the cancellation of more than 100 contracts, an act that a contracting officer described in a sworn affidavit as including “all contracts related to enforcement, supervision, external affairs, and consumer response.” Another message involved how to transfer to the Treasury Department some of the more than $3 billion in civil penalties that the bureau has collected from companies to settle consumer protection cases, a move that could deny harmed consumers compensation. A third discussed the terms of an agreement that would allow for the mass layoff of staffers, court records show. In his financial disclosure form, which he signed on Feb. 15, Young listed his employment by Musk’s Europa 100 as active, beginning in August 2024 through the “present.” Then, in early March, as the legal fight over the administration’s cuts played out before a federal judge, Young sent the CFPB’s chief operating officer a message about forthcoming firings, known as a “reduction in force,” or RIF, in government parlance. In the email, he asked whether officials were “prepared to implement the RIF” if the judge lifted a temporary stay, according to a March district court opinion that has for the moment stopped most of the administration’s proposed cuts. Read More In addition to his employment, Young’s disclosure presents another potential conflict. He also lists owning as much as $15,000 in Amazon stock, a company that is on the bureau’s “Prohibited Holdings” list. Agency employees are forbidden from having such investments, and ethics experts have said that participating in an agency action that could boost the stock’s value — such as stripping the CFPB of its staff — constitutes a violation of the criminal conflict-of-interest statute. Young hasn’t responded to questions about that either. Al Shaw contributed reporting and Alex Mierjeski contributed research.

Title: Next Crypto to Explode as VanEck Launches US Treasury Fund Tokens on Ethereum and Solana

Proving there’s never a dull moment in the crypto market, yet another US asset manager – VanEck – is embracing the digital-assets era by launching a tokenized US Treasury fund. That’s good news for the traditional and crypto finance worlds, as well as the next crypto to explode. The VanEck Treasury Fund (VBILL) is a blockchain-based investment vehicle that provides digital access to short-term US government bonds. So whereas those bonds were traditionally accessed through banks and brokers, qualified investors can now access them with stablecoins, like $USDC. By the way, by ‘qualified,’ we mean large. VBILL requires a minimum investment of $1M on Ethereum, and $100K on the other blockchains it’s available on. Those include Solana, BNB Chain, and Avalanche networks. VanEck is no newcomer to the crypto scene – it already issues spot $BTC and $ETH ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and ETNs (exchange-traded notes). And now it’s following the lead of BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and other firms by tokenizing traditional assets. In another positive move for crypto, cross-border banking giant Standard Charter is also increasing its crypto activity. Standard Charter is now collaborating with digital-asset prime brokerage FalconX, which will integrate the bank’s forex services and infrastructure to provide its institutional clients with a broader range of offerings. This comes after the recent announcement of a partnership with OKX that enables institutional clients to use crypto as collateral. According to a Standard Global press release, the collaboration ‘continues FalconX’s efforts to bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets with enterprise-grade infrastructure’. As digital assets are increasingly embraced by the traditional finance sector worldwide, it’s great news for the crypto market – and investors. With the Bitcoin price back up above the $100K mark, the market is looking bullish. And what’s good for the $BTC is generally good for other tokens. If you’re looking to invest in what could be the next crypto to explode, here are options well worth considering – including the best presale tokens of the year. The Solana blockchain is second only to Ethereum in terms of market dominance and the number of tokens. It’s fast and has relatively low transaction costs. But Solana is also plagued by network congestion and failed transactions. That’s where Solaxy ($SOLX) steps up to the plate. This meme coin is introducing the first-ever Layer-2 Solana platform – and that’s a big deal in the crypto world. Solaxy is building on Solana’s strong points (speed, low costs) and adding to it. The $SOLX project has solid tokenomics, with 30% allocated to development. That will be an important aspect of its long-term success. It’s also why $SOLX could be the next crypto to explode. Investor interest has so far been impressive. This is one of the best meme coins on presale – it has already raised $35.5M in funding. We expect big things to come from Solaxy after the presale ends and it lists on DEXs and CEXs. And that means there’s no better time to invest in $SOLX, with its current presale price of $0.001724 and 113% staking rewards. Take a look at our complete guide to buying in Solaxy – as well as our $SOLX price prediction – to find out how to make the most of what has the potential to be the next crypto to explode. In another crypto first, enter BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – the one and only meme coin that tracks Bitcoin’s price. And when that price reaches a milestone, $BTCBULL holders will be airdropped $BTC as a reward. Considering $BTC’s recent bull run, there’s little reason not to expect its price to hit the $150K, $200K, and onwards to $1M in the not-too-distant future. It’s exactly at those milestones that holders of $BTCBULL will receive their own $BTC in the Best Wallet app. The $BTC rewards will be airdropped each time the price grows by $50K. And in-between – at $125K, $175K, and $225K thresholds – $BTCBULL tokens will be burned, adding to the scarcity (and potentially the value) of the token. If you’re keen to ride the $BTC bull run, you may find our full guide to buying the Bitcoin Bull Token helpful. It explains how to buy this top new crypto token – $BTCBULL – at its current price of $0.00251, with 72% APY staking. ChainGPT ($CGPT) is the native token of the ChainGPT ecosystem. This Web3 platform combines artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain to provide AI-powered tools that pretty much anyone can use – individuals or businesses – without having advanced technical knowledge. Among the ChainGPT AI offerings are a smart contract generator and auditor; NFT generator; trading assistant; Web3 chatbot; and a tool that enables you to build an AI agent (like MIND of Pepe, for instance) without coding. All those features are powered by $CGPT token. $CGPT holders also have voting rights in decision-making. And with growing adoption of crypto as a legitimate asset, this may well mean the $CGPT is among the best altcoins – and the next crypto to explode. Unlike $SOLX and $BTCBULL, $CGPT is not on presale. It is currently listed on both CEXs (including Binance, ByBit, MEXC, and KuCoin) and DEXs – PancakeSwap and Uniswap. One $CGPT currently costs $0.141, making it an affordable investment with potentially explosive gains. Touch wood, but things appear to be looking up for the crypto market. That sentiment is clear with the likes of the VanEck Treasury Fund being launched, and Standard Global partnering with FalconX. A recovery in the Bitcoin price also signals light on the horizon. And with that, the next crypto with the potential to explode – Solaxy, BTC Bull Token, and ChainGPT among them – may mean highly impressive gains.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/03/30: In this photo illustration, the Wolfspeed logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Wolfspeed (NASDAQ: WOLF), a pioneer in silicon carbide semiconductor technology for the electric vehicle market, is facing severe financial distress with its stock now down 42% year-to-date. Trading at just $4, the stock has plummeted over 85% from its 52-week high of more than $30. While WOLF stock has performed poorly, if you are looking for an upside with a smoother experience than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P, achieving >91% returns since its inception. The semiconductor company's fundamental financial metrics reveal a troubling picture: Beyond these heavy losses, Wolfspeed's balance sheet shows critical weakness due to excessive leverage: In its latest quarterly results, Wolfspeed showed some minor improvement by narrowing its net loss to $0.72 per share, better than the expected $0.82 loss. However, the company reported revenues of $185 million, slightly missing expectations, and it provided a fiscal 2026 sales outlook of $850 million, substantially below the consensus estimate of $960 million. Separately, see – What's Behind The 300% Rise In AVGO Stock? The severity of Wolfspeed’s situation has prompted its creditors to offer $600 million in new funding to help the company avoid bankruptcy. This development highlights the existential crisis facing the silicon carbide chip manufacturer. These funds would be used to refinance a significant convertible bond that will mature in 2026 and to supply additional working capital. Despite Wolfspeed’s position in the promising silicon carbide market, which offers more energy-efficient solutions than traditional silicon chips for electric vehicles, the company’s financial reality raises serious questions about its viability as an investment. The combination of deep operating losses, massive debt, and underwhelming future revenue projections creates significant risk for investors. With numerous stronger investment alternatives available in the current market, potential investors should carefully weigh whether Wolfspeed represents a turnaround opportunity or a continued downward spiral, even with the proposed new funding. Just remember – WOLF stock is still a wild ride, and as a long-term investment option, you can explore the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which is rooted in quality that seeks reliability, predictability, and compounding growth. With a collection of 30 stocks, it has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. Price is one of the biggest barriers to EV adoption. But thanks to a new type of battery, General Motors plans to slash the cost of some of its rechargeable vehicles. The battery, which has been under development for a decade, uses more of the cheaper elements like manganese and far less cobalt and nickel than current lithium-ion cells. That will cut the cost of battery packs in models like the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Hummer and Cadillac Escalade by more than $6,000, a GM executive told Forbes. And while GM currently falls behind Tesla as the largest seller of EVs in the U.S., that could change as Elon Musk’s firm struggles. Chime CEO and cofounder Chris Britt As the stock market rebounds, Chime, America’s largest digital bank, has filed publicly with the SEC for an initial public offering, revealing its detailed financials. Chime has catered largely to younger Americans earning between $35,000 and $65,000 and has built a sticky business by requiring customers to set up direct deposit to get access to a growing list of features. Donald Trump is considering accepting a plane from Qatar, a gesture from the energy-rich monarchy that plays directly to the billionaire’s ego. Trump has long preferred oversized planes, personalizing airliners too big to land in some airports over the more nimble jets that most executives prefer. Alan Marcus, a communications consultant who used to ride on Trump’s old Boeing 727, compared it to a stereotypical debate over the size of​ one’s male anatomy. Prices rose less than economists expected in the first inflation report since President Donald Trump unveiled his “Liberation Day” tariffs. But while it was the most moderate inflation reading in over four years, the data doesn’t capture the full impact of tariffs on consumers—and the frequent changes in the tariff rates make it difficult to gauge what that will look like. In a move that could provide relief to ecommerce firms like Shein and Temu, the White House said it lowered tariffs on packages from China valued at less than $800 from 120% to 54%. Packages under that value were previously exempt from tariffs or customs duties through the “de minimis” loophole, which Trump eliminated, then reinstated, then eliminated again. After Forbes uncovered financial problems and layoffs at Wondermind, the mental health startup cofounded by actor and business mogul Selena Gomez, it set off a debate over how much Gomez is really worth. Forbes found that Gomez is very wealthy, but not a billionaire, worth roughly $700 million—though she still ranks among the wealthiest self-made women entrepreneurs in the country. A key court hearing took place Tuesday, as a coalition of small businesses are seeking to block President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs as legal challenges against the import taxes move forward. It’s unclear how the court will rule, and it’s only the first step in what’s likely to be a lengthy legal process, as multiple lawsuits have been filed. Trump meets with Syrian President Ahmed al-Shara along with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin ... More Salman Al Saud. (Photo by Bandar Al-Jaloud/Saudi Royal Court/Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images) President Donald Trump met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Shara in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, a day after announcing plans to lift U.S. sanctions on Syria, a significant boost to the country’s new leadership as it attempts to shore up international support after a nearly a decade and a half-long civil war. Addressing the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Trump said he “felt very strongly” that dropping the “really crippling” sanctions would give Syria a chance. Operations at Newark Airport appear to have normalized after two weeks of chaos that included equipment failures in which air traffic controllers lost communication with pilots three times. The airport was under a ground delay Tuesday, but there were markedly fewer canceled and delayed flights, according to data from FlightAware. Despite A History Of Bribery And Corruption Among Top Shareholders, The World’s Largest Meatpacker Prepares To Go Public Billionaires Joesley (left) and Wesley Batista After a decade-long beef with the SEC as well as bipartisan opposition in Congress, the world’s largest meatpacker was finally given the green light in late April to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The U.S. listing of the Brazil-based JBS has been delayed several times over the past decade due to a deluge of scandals involving the top shareholders and their holding company—including bribes to Brazilian meat inspectors, kickbacks to government financiers and illegal campaign contributions to more than 1,800 Brazilian politicians. That is in addition to accusations in the U.S. of JBS and companies it owns of price-fixing, wage-manipulating and violating child labor laws, plus allegations of discrimination and harassment. Over the past two decades, brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista have turned their family’s South American meat business into a global goliath with more than $77 billion in annual revenue. Its major U.S. brands include Swift, Pilgrim’s Pride, Primo, Blue Ribbon and Certified Agnus Beef. The Batista brothers are the company’s largest shareholders, and Forbes estimates that Joesley and Wesley are worth $4.8 billion each. They have also been personally charged with foreign corruption in the U.S. as well as insider trading allegations in Brazil. But the Batistas’ fortune changed when Donald Trump returned to the White House in January. The long-delayed SEC approval for JBS’ dual-listing came just two days after it was revealed in a public filing with the federal election commission that the largest donor to the Trump Inaugural Committee was the JBS subsidiary, chicken processor Pilgrim’s Pride. A JBS spokesperson denied any link in the timing of the donation. WHY IT MATTERS In addition to the extensive bribery scheme, JBS has also faced allegations of environmental damage, particularly that it knowingly buys cattle that have been raised on ranchland created by deforesting the Amazon, though a JBS spokesperson denies that. Now that the public listing is approved, it will give JBS access to U.S.-only investors, pensions and stock indices. The share price is expected to take off, with Carlos Laboy, a managing director who heads up Latin American food coverage including JBS at HSBC, estimating JBS could double in value. That would give JBS “more resources to solve the environmental issues that need to be solved.” MORE Who’s Afraid Of Big Bad Boar’s Head?

Beyond the expenses like providing severance and increased administrative work, employee productivity can plummet, and studies have shown that voluntary turnover often increases as well. If it’s necessary to cut back, try to optimize management layers, reduce the workforce through natural attrition, and if you must lay off employees, be sure to treat them with dignity.

Title: Why Catalytic Capital Needs a Better Definition (Blog)

The decline and fall of ESG offers a cautionary tale for social impact financing and highlights the need for the sector to sharpen its understanding of catalytic capital.

The decline and fall of ESG offers a cautionary tale for social impact financing and highlights the need for the sector to sharpen its understanding of catalytic capital. We propose a potential definitional framework for catalytic capital to drive clarity, measurement, and greater market participation. By Savannah Baum, Olivia Rosen, Sean Sellers & Billy Silk May 14, 2025 On the heels of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards exploded onto the scene as a way for companies to focus on sustainability in business decisions and for investors to prioritize socially responsible companies. In the years that followed, trillions of dollars poured into ESG funds. But cracks started to emerge. As journalists looked under the hood of ESG funds, they found investments in oil and gas majors. In 2021, Tariq Fancy, former chief investment officer for sustainable investing at Blackrock, the world’s largest asset manager, penned a scathing essay that the ESG label was being used to dupe the American public with greenwashing. Backlash against the consideration of social factors in investments also began to grow; in recent years, 19 US states have passed 42 anti-ESG laws preventing public fund managers from taking social considerations into account. At its core, ESG’s problem stems from a lack of clarity. There are, of course, innumerable instances of ESG-focused funds leading important change globally. Many have helped reform operational and governance standards within corporations, and forced internal dialogue and measurement efforts to gauge social progress. But in the absence of clear, value-based standards, it’s often just a buzzword. Its loosely defined, “yes and” posture allows companies and investors to toss it around to validate their commitment to social good without having to meet specific requirements. Companies’ loquacious race to classify themselves as “ESG-approved” has led to justified attack, with shareholder support for ESG declining and institutional investors citing ESG fatigue. The ESG movement may be too far gone to revive. But its fate can help shape the development of another type of impact financing: catalytic capital. A sharper, shared understanding of this form of risk-tolerant investment, which takes on risk to validate a new business model or market with the aim of ultimately drawing in more capital, can dramatically increase the volume and scope of funding for social impact. Are you enjoying this article? Read more like this, plus SSIR's full archive of content, when you subscribe. To scale promising social enterprises, leaders of social change need access to context-appropriate capital—funding that considers and addresses the unique risks and needs (such as limited liquidity and longer timelines) that ventures in challenging markets face. This type of investment is widely known as catalytic capital and is remarkably good at market building. According to Convergence, every $1 of catalytic capital mobilizes $4 of downstream traditional investment for social impact efforts. A compelling example is FarmWorks, a social enterprise that provides farming inputs, finance, training, and market access to smallholder farmers in Kenya. In 2020, the company’s co-founders Yi Li and Peter Muthee began looking for investors who understood the unique needs of building an agricultural business in the region. FarmWorks’ business model was fundamentally different than the high-margin software businesses typically favored by venture capital. As Li explains, "To sell a kilo of tomatoes, you're growing another kilo of tomatoes," underscoring the methodical nature of agricultural scaling compared to typical venture-backed businesses. Building FarmWorks also meant developing extensive logistics networks, managing relationships with thousands of farmers, and operating warehouses across the region. Like many social ventures in emerging economies, the company also faced limited supply and payment infrastructure, complex distribution channels, and customers with constrained purchasing power. Its path to profitability would be longer, and its exit strategy less defined than what traditional investors typically sought. As Li told us, "For businesses like FarmWorks that are not disrupting a model but are significantly improving the efficiency and scale of possibility [in] a traditional sector, patience is required.” In 2021, Acumen’s Resilient Agriculture Fund stepped in to provide pre-seed, patient capital, a form of catalytic capital geared toward longer horizons. This allowed the team to honor their ambitious mission sustainably without short-sighted pressures of quick exits and high returns. The company used initial funding to grow its services into an integrated suite of end-to-end support, including financing for low-cost machinery and reliable access to markets, and became the largest domestic distributor of fresh vegetables in Kenya within four years. Today, it works with 3,000 farmers to bring produce to market, and sells more than 1,000 tons of local staples and high-value crops monthly. A recent $4.1 million, pre-series A funding round—led by Acumen Resilient Agriculture Fund and supported by Livelihood Impact Fund, Vested World, family offices, and angel investors—signaled confidence in both the company’s market opportunity and ability to scale systems-level impact. Estimates vary, but proxies suggest that catalytic capital constitutes less than 0.01 percent of global investment capital. And while the impact investing market has grown to approximately $1.1 trillion, only a fraction of this sum can be considered catalytic capital. This scarcity of flexible funding for early-stage social ventures that are working in challenging but promising markets isn't just about numbers; it represents a tremendous amount of transformative impact left unrealized. On the surface, the definition of catalytic capital may seem clear: flexible financing for impact ventures that investors can tailor to take on unique risks. But go a level deeper, and questions proliferate. What kinds of risk? What kinds of financing? Different organizations perceive catalytic capital differently. For example, some emphasize concessionary returns that trade lower financial gains for social impact, some focus on taking on greater market risk, and some aim to benefit specific groups of people. Some argue that any concessionary instrument (including a loan or a grant) qualifies, while others insist that the investment must pull more traditional financiers into these markets via blended transactions or follow-on investments. During our time as MBA candidates pursuing social impact research, we’ve spoken with many investors and professors experienced with catalytic capital who believe some definitional flexibility is good. Rather than gatekeeping on semantics, they believe maintaining some openness to different forms of catalytic capital helps bring more investors into the market. We don’t necessarily disagree. But they also recognize the downsides of ambiguity. Inconsistent definitions present a number of problems. For example, it’s time-consuming and challenging for social entrepreneurs to look across the wide range of impact capital providers to identify who might be the right investor for their unique needs. Catalytic investors meanwhile struggle to collaborate on deal flow to solve market gaps, and follow-on or commercial co-investors struggle to compare deals side-by-side. The result is an inefficient catalytic capital market with limited impact. Delineating catalytic capital by the mechanisms through which it operates, however, can improve everyone’s understanding, more efficiently match market needs with particular investor flexibilities, and ultimately scale more impact through greater capital flows. For example, a biotech startup developing a maternal health diagnostic may need highly flexible, long-term capital due to high R&D costs, regulatory hurdles, and a delayed path to revenue. This would make it better suited to non-concessionary patient capital. In contrast, a community-owned broadband provider serving rural areas might achieve steady revenue relatively quickly through subscriber fees but operate with intentionally limited margins to keep services affordable. While it can generate cash flow, its social mission caps its returns. This makes it a better fit for concessionary capital that prioritizes impact over market-rate returns. Both models create meaningful impact but require different capital structures to thrive. Catalytic capital is intended to “go first”—derisking an asset or market with the goal of attracting additional investments, often from conventional investors who wouldn’t otherwise participate. It’s thus important to ensure that conventional investors can compare deals apples-to-apples—including elements like impact metrics, mobilization goals, or market forecasts—so that they don’t walk away from the market altogether. As noted earlier, investors aren’t monolithic. Catalytic and commercial investors have unique preferences; their motivations, risk appetites, and returns expectations differ. One catalytic investor may be willing to seek concessionary returns on loans, while another might sacrifice on return horizons. Co-investors are similarly diverse; what makes an investment too risky for one commercial lender will differ from another. And certainly, investee needs vary widely. In addition, while many impact investors do great work determining the needs of specific markets to close financing gaps, they often do so in silos. No coordinating body actively tracks and shares financing gaps across markets or maps where specific investors are most willing to take on specific risks. Given this, a lot of great deals that aren’t a fit for one investor likely die when a better-suited capital provider might have carried them forward. Clearer definitions can address these market failures in several ways. For one, they reduce transaction friction for entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs are too often left in the dark, unable to determine which capital stacks and investors best match their business needs. Better definitions for the type of risks individual catalytic investors are willing to take on equips entrepreneurs with the knowledge they need to find the right investors. In addition, they improve market efficiency by better matching capital to opportunity. Although the motivations and capabilities of catalytic investors vary widely, they often cluster around similar opportunities while leaving other needs unmet. More clearly distinguishing the different dimensions of catalytic capital can help them identify the right fit. Clearer definitions also enable better investor coordination. When investors can clearly articulate their risk appetites and preferred impact dimensions, they can more effectively combine forces. They help align traditional investors with relevant catalytic investors who have the right tools to sufficiently de-risk specific areas of concern. Given this opportunity to create a more robust and responsive impact capital market, we propose a new framework for defining catalytic capital that has two parts: requisite properties and dynamic attributes. We do not propose this framework with the expectation that it answers every ambiguous question around catalytic capital, or even that this is the “right” set of guardrails for all catalytic market participants. We hope this framework can serve as a starting point for discussion on the anatomy and gradient of catalytic investments, with both traditional and non-traditional dimensions. It also aims to strike a balance between rigor, clarity, and flexibility. The first part, requisite properties, offers a baseline understanding of what catalytic capital “must be and do,” and includes three criteria: The second part of the framework then proposes that catalytic capital must be dynamic in at least one of five (but usually more) specific attributes: An investment does not need to fall in the leftmost box of every dimension in the chart to be catalytic. Indeed, many catalytic investments incorporate more traditional features across several dimensions. For example, investors might consider an investment that deviates meaningfully from at least one standard commercial norm (the chart’s rightmost boxes) somewhat catalytic. A debt instrument with conventional liquidity and a standard return timeline might offer concessionary returns and take a first-loss position in the capital stack (the order in which investors are repaid if the company defaults) if the investee defaults. Investors might also consider an investment that is non-concessionary but allows abnormally long timelines for return catalytic. For example, an investor in carbon projects might demand strong returns (say, a 15 percent internal rate of return) but allow investees to repay them over 15-20 years instead of the more traditional 8-10 years. Understanding where an investment falls within this taxonomy enables more effective market engagement, offering a shared language and clearer perspective on what type of catalytic capital is and is not being deployed. In the absence of widely adopted, data-driven approaches or logic-tested theories of change, investor commitment to ESG has proven fleeting. Better definitions and specific language can help catalytic capital avoid the same fate, and provide a more reasoned commitment to market development and systemic change. The framework presented here is not an exercise in dogmatism, attempting to set forth rigid definitions that limit participation. It is an attempt to support the discipline and rigor of like-minded entrepreneurs and investors in pursuit of more effective collaboration. Incremental changes, driven by clearer frameworks and objective standards, will ultimately lead to much greater impact than chasing buzzwords or hype. More stories like that of FarmWorks are waiting to be written, and their chapters can unfold when visionary entrepreneurs align with the right investors and timing. Some may want ambiguity to persist in the name of inclusion, but allowing anyone to call their capital catalytic risks a more troubling exclusion: holding communities back from building and sharing a more prosperous future. Developing a shared understanding in service of better coordination is an important next step in the field’s evolution. Support SSIR’s coverage of cross-sector solutions to global challenges.

Title: The streaming wars are no longer just about who is the biggest

Time Published: 2025-05-14T11:56:30Z
Full Content:
Good morning. One of the key accusers in the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial testified Tuesday in court. R&B singer Cassie Ventura, who dated Combs for over a decade, spoke about joining in on the drug-fueled sex marathons that he called "freak offs." In today's big story, ESPN finally unveiled the streaming-only version of its channel, and it comes as streamers reevaluate how they judge success. Tech Memo, a weekly BI newsletter from Alistair Barr, is launching soon. Sign up here! What's on deck Markets: Brevan Howard taps a longtime JPMorgan dealmaker for a new senior role. Tech: Job cuts are officially underway at Microsoft. Business: The hidden intention behind some companies' RTO plans isn't about getting back to the office. But first, what channel stream is it on? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. One of the last holdouts of the streaming era is finally making a move. ESPN unveiled plans — and a price — for its long-awaited streaming version of the sports channel. Business Insider's Peter Kafka has the rundown on Tuesday's launch event for ESPN's new service, which will cost $30 a month. (Not to be confused with ESPN+, which has been around for over seven years. While ESPN+ streams live games, the biggest sporting events can't be watched there without a cable TV subscription. Unlike ESPN+, this new streamer will include everything you'd get if you were watching ESPN on cable TV.) ESPN's willingness to finally cut the cord shows how much the TV landscape has changed. But it's not just streamers fighting for subscribers. From engagement to subscriber growth to profitability, streamers have different priorities, writes BI's James Faris. So what are the different strategies, and who is running them? James does a great job of breaking it all down, but here's a quick rundown. The engagement approach: Netflix, Amazon When you're at the top, you sometimes have to find new ways to define success. After clearing the 300 million subscriber milestone, Netflix is now focusing on keeping users engaged rather than just growing. The reason? Engaged users are good for ads, which is the next big opportunity the streamer sees. It's not alone, as Amazon went all in on ads last year when it automatically turned them on for Prime Video users who weren't willing to cough up $3 a month to remove them. The subscriber approach: Disney, Paramount+, Peacock For those not lucky enough to have a massive subscriber base, growing the number of users is still a priority. One challenge has been keeping the momentum from big events like the Olympics or NFL playoff games. Of course, sometimes you might have even more viewers than you realize. That's why password-sharing crackdowns are all the rage. The profitability approach: Max Subscribers. Engagement. Let's be honest, the end goal is the same: making money. Warner Bros. Discovery already conceded that Max won't rule the streaming roost. But it is in the black, something some of its peers can't claim. 1. Inflation surprisingly cooled in April. The inflation rate slowed to 2.3% last month from March's 2.4% year-over-year bump, making it the smallest increase since 2021. Still, forecasters said the effects of the trade war could show up as soon as next month. On the plus side, eggs are back on the menu for breakfast. 2. Brevan Howard hires Carlos Hernandez. The longtime JPMorgan dealmaker will be Brevan Howard's first-ever executive chair. A person close to the manager told BI that Hernandez's role will focus on high-level corporate strategy and client development. 3. Getting a job in secondaries. The investment strategy of buying stakes in private funds from investors who want to sell early used to be niche. Secondaries are now fundraising at record levels, and a lucrative career path is emerging. Here's how to land a job in the booming industry. 1. Microsoft's job cuts are here. The software giant has started culling managers and noncoders as part of its plan to shed about 6,000 jobs. It wants fewer managers with more reports, consistent with an industrywide push to flatten management layers. 2. AI companies stand to win in Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill" — for now. The bill includes a provision preventing states from regulating AI for 10 years, a godsend for companies like OpenAI and Meta. However, there's a good reason they shouldn't start celebrating yet. 3. The CEOs behind your favorite YouTube stars. Content creators from MrBeast to Smosh are hiring leaders from Hollywood, talent management firms, and creator economy startups to level up their businesses. These executives allow creators to focus on content — and avoid burnout. 1. Employers have found a sneaky substitute for layoffs. Rather than conducting layoffs, some employers are using RTO mandates to get workers to quit. But companies adopting this take-it-or-leave-it approach to RTO can end up with the worst of both worlds, BI's Aki Ito writes. 2. You can now book private chefs and personal trainers on Airbnb. The company rolled out Airbnb Services, which lets users hire professionals like hairstylists or photographers to come to their Airbnb or home. An exec told BI it's one way the company is trying to win customers back from hotels. 3. Trump is asking Americans to do the one thing they hate most. Buying things is a national pastime, and Trump is the king of conspicuous consumption. But after issuing tariffs, the president is preaching austerity — a misread of both America's economy and culture. Sony reports earnings.

Title: Many Market Opportunities To Come As Tariff Debacle Concludes, According to Fundstrat’s Tom Lee – Here’s His Outlook

Fundstrat’s Tom Lee sees a lot of opportunity in the stock market this year. In a new interview with CNBC, Lee argues that US businesses have demonstrated resiliency in the face of the pandemic, rate hikes and now tariffs. “Right now, the 10-Year yield at 4% I think isn’t a huge burden, not only for the government, but also for the economy or for companies, so I think it’s a level of funding that businesses can earn a return on capital, and then as we think about 2026, there’s a lot to be excited about, we have deregulation coming, we have the tariff debacle behind us, we have tax cuts possibly, and then we might have better trade partnerships with other countries, meaning US companies have earnings upside. I think that the market is flat year-to-date through May, so I don’t think anyone should feel like they missed anything. I think that they’re going to have a chance to buy a lot of companies – a lot of stocks got obliterated, and I think that these washed-out names are still opportunities. We talk about it with our clients, whether it’s Tesla, or the MAG-7 (Magnificent 7), or the small-caps, there are many opportunities still.” The Magnificent Seven stocks include shares of the tech giants Tesla, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia. As of Tuesday’s close, the S&P 500 is trading at 5,886.

Title: At This $5 Billion Ohio Advisory, Financial Planning Comes With A Wall Of Touch Screens And A Dose Of AI

Time Published: 2025-05-14T11:30:00Z
Full Content:
BySergei Klebnikov BySergei Klebnikov, Forbes Staff. CEO Craig Findley works in the Venture Lab. Walking into Venture Visionary Partners’ gleaming Sylvania, Ohio headquarters just outside of Toledo feels less like entering a wealth management firm and more like stepping into the lobby of a Silicon Valley innovator. A serene waterfall greets you at the door; sleek glass offices line the halls, while oversized digital screens pulse with real-time data and market updates. But the real centerpiece—and increasingly a beating heart of the operation—is tucked beyond the conference rooms up on the second floor: the Venture Visionary Lab. A brainchild of founder and CEO Craig Findley, the high tech control room is an unusual setting for a wealth management industry steeped in virtues like patience and measured growth. “It’s like having a second brain in the room,” argues Findley with a smile, gesturing to the space where every wall is a floor-to-ceiling touch screen. Essentially a war room meant to resemble a mini New York Stock Exchange, it combines institutional-grade investment research with Venture’s proprietary tools—and a heavy dose of cutting-edge AI, powered by OpenAI. The Lab is both an R&D center and an expensive client marketing tool used to impress its mostly midwestern clientele. "It helps clients see that we take this seriously," says Findley, 55, a finance and marketing major who graduated from Michigan’s Hillsdale College, a small, Christian, liberal arts school, in 1992. And for clients who love tech? "They’re frankly blown away." Originally envisioned as a trading, research and collaboration hub, the Lab has evolved into something much more ambitious. The room’s four walls are giant, interactive planar screens, connected to laptops through a simple barcode device. Facial recognition is required for entry, and a virtual AI assistant—cheerily nicknamed "Venture"—is ready to take notes, pull up investment research, or even recall a client’s last conversation at a moment's notice. Soon, Findley hopes, the Lab will be fully voice interactive. "Eventually, it will greet us—and clients—when we walk in," he says. Today, it's already partially there: Ask Venture about a company or client, and within seconds it retrieves curated information drawn from its approved research sources and CRM system. Founded in 2019, the $5.1 billion (assets under management) registered investment advisory firm prides itself on building deep, personalized relationships with clients, but now technology has supercharged that approach. All that high technology is not free. Findley figures his outfitting Venture Visionary Lab cost him no less than $500,000 to complete. In terms of fees, his firm traditionally charges 1% to 1.5% of assets, according to its SEC filings. One of the keys to Findley’s approach is the quality of his data inputs. New clients fill out a 62-question personality and values assessment, probing everything from relationship priorities to legacy goals. Questions vary from seemingly trivial matters about whether a client has hired a lawyer or made up a will to to more in-depth enquiries such as the core values that guide their work and personal lives. Once complete, a client’s answers are reflected back to them across the Lab’s vast digital screen in a personalized “mind map.” While this discovery process isn’t new for Venture, displaying these answers for clients in the Lab over recent months has not only made it a more interactive process but also more efficient, where Findley and his team can better identify client priorities. “It allows us to better get in the weeds during the discovery process,” he adds. The Lab doesn’t just wow clients—it helps Venture's advisors work smarter with its AI capturing meeting notes and assigns follow ups. If a client mentioned their daughter’s college acceptance during a meeting six months ago? Venture will remember—and suggest a timely congratulatory follow-up at the next touchpoint. Investment committee meetings take place inside the Venture lab. The Lab also plays a helpful role in Venture Visionary Partners’ process as a tool during investment committee meetings. Say Findley and his team are looking at Tesla stock for instance. The AI assistant can quickly pull up summarized analyst reports, financial documents and earnings calls for review, helping the firm spot patterns faster when it comes to portfolio management. They have also begun leveraging Boosted.ai’s Alfa chatbot to improve the efficiency and accuracy of market research. For instance, the team recently prompted Alfa to analyze Russell 1000 companies that reported earnings over the past three months and identify those that beat both EPS and revenue estimates. “We then paired that data with Seeking Alpha’s Earnings Revision Scores to highlight ‘triple beat’ companies—those that not only exceeded earnings and revenue expectations but also raised forward guidance,” says Findley. The firm’s flagship strategy is rising dividend stocks, primarily focusing on U.S. large-cap companies. For more aggressive investors, Venture offers a growth-at-a-reasonable-price strategy that seeks to capture long-term capital appreciation without chasing overheated momentum stocks. For opportunities that don’t neatly fit either profile, the firm runs an opportunistic strategy, giving the investment team flexibility to pursue compelling outliers. Some of the team’s top stock picks from these strategies include tech giants Meta and Amazon, which are trading at lower price to earnings multiples than slow-growth consumer staples like Coke and lower than top retailers Walmart and Costco, respectively. Findley also likes brokerage app Robinhood, which he says was undervalued after the market drop in April and should continue to perform well thanks to rapid earnings growth. Another top stock pick is Morgan Stanley, which could see robust growth on the back of increased corporate dealmaking and rising markets. “The stock is still 11% below the February high and trades at a fairly reasonable 14 times earnings,” says Findley. Venture also offers an ETF-based strategy that balances passive investing with tactical tilts toward sectors like technology and communications. On the fixed income side, the firm is content to take advantage of higher near-term yields by investing in government bonds, structured notes, and private credit opportunities. “We try to take the emotions out of investing," Findley says. "Clients get so caught up in politics or short-term news. History—and a visual—is worth a thousand words.” That discipline has been particularly important in recent months, as a barrage of headlines relating to Trump administration policies have whipsawed markets. Though major indexes like the S&P 500 tanked more than 10% following Trump’s initial tariff announcements in early April, the market has since leveled out and is now once again positive for the year. “Tariff policy, although well intended, caused considerable uncertainty,” says Findley. When asked about the future, Findley’s has a clear vision: Even more integration and automation for the client experience and decision-making process—but always with a human touch. “I want a client to walk into the Lab, have it recognize them by face, greet them personally, recall their last visit, and pull up everything we need without lifting a finger,” he says. But will Findley’s expensive AI-fueled rocketship also help create higher returns for Venture Visionary’s clients? The jury is still out.

Title: Crypto Daybook Americas: Altcoins Rally as ‘Complacent’ Bitcoin Points to Renewed Volatility

You are viewing Crypto Daybook Americas, your new morning briefing on what happened in the crypto markets overnight and what's expected during the coming day. Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Investors are still rotating money into altcoins, lifting valuations for ETH, RAY, ENA, MKR and other tokens while leaving bitcoin (BTC) little changed above $100,000. While the biggest cryptocurrency by market value is just 7% short of hitting a new high, its 30-day options-based implied or expected volatility, represented by Deribit's DVOL index, is hovering near the lowest level since June 2024. This type of calm usually precedes big moves. Georgii Verbitskii, a market analyst and founder of TYMIO, a crypto investor app put it best: "Options implied volatility is extremely low, the market doesn't seem to believe in strong moves, and 1- to 3-month option pricing is still cheap. That kind of complacency often precedes a big move." BTC could quickly break through $115,000, Verbitskii said, noting that, "If the liquidity thesis holds — where global liquidity supports bitcoin — we could see that breakout as early as May." Just to remind you, bitcoin hit a record high around $109,000 in January. Still, the market faces potential headwinds. For instance, the U.S. Senate has its last opportunity to pass the bipartisan GENIUS Act, a bill introduced in February that calls for issuers to back digital currencies with safe reserves and report them monthly or deal with penalties. The bill was unable to advance in a recent vote. According to the Senate's rules another failure will kill the bill unless all senators agree to reconsider, according to Tagus Capital. Further, the U.S. SEC delayed a decision on Tuesday on whether to allow in-kind redemptions for BlackRock's bitcoin exchange-traded fund while it asks for feedback. In other news, DeFi Development Corp. purchased 172,670 SOL worth roughly $23.6 million, bringing its total Solana Treasury holdings to over $100 million.

Pull the military out and send those prisoners to a supermax prison in the US. Yes, they will then be entitled to full rights to defend themselves in American courts but we all have to make sacrifices. That leaves you with 45 square miles (117 km2) of land and water on the shore of Guantánamo Bay. So then you take a page out of Trump’s playbook and turn it into a luxurious resort for the rich and wealthy. You can have high-priced hotels, casinos, knocking shops, restaurants and shopping arcades. If you told Trump that a prime block of land would be set aside for a Trump hotel, he would totally buy into the whole project. Workers you ask? Put in contracts for Cuban workers and buy produce from them to keep the Cubans onside and not to stir up trouble. It’s either that or follow that tech bro plan which would be nothing more that a money pit – with them the major beneficiaries. Much better than the status quo, so why not give it a try?

A scam for all seasons. https://t.co/hgHr4TlauL I completely disagree with all commentators currently claiming a “break” in US/Israeli relations or speaking about a mood shift or Trump breaking with Netenyahu. You are only confused here if you accept such claims as valid. Trump is not lifting all Syrian sanctions for nothing, and we are certainly not speaking about mineral rights or any other such nonsense here. The genocide is still on, Netenyahu is still open about it, and I would bet my last cent that the concessions extracted from this deal are that Syria will take in Gazan refugees. I think this is primary purpose of Trump’s entire trip, to carry on the very same Israeli and State Department policy that was formulated in October/November of 2023. Every manner of PR and bullshit media flak has been thrown up around this but the plan has carried on regardless for 19 months now. I see no reason to think Trump’s tour is not simply a repeat of Bliken’s efforts in 2023 and 2024 to find somewhere to dump the still living Gazans. Whether the rest of the Arab states have agreed to the displacement, I don’t know. But I for one am certain that the cutout Jolani has agreed to facilitate the ethnic cleansing of Gaza(His trip to meet Macron has convinced me). I am surprised so many commentators have forgotten about this entire angle. Pipeline gas from Qatar to Europe, via Saudi, Jordan and Syria? Taiwan is playing with darkness by abandoning nuclear power Intellinews The article flies over a few facts, making it seem that its the current government that has abandoned nuclear power – in reality, that decision was made 20 years or more when a number of plants under construction were mothballed – partially because they didn’t make much economic sense at the time, and partially under intense US pressure over its nuclear weapons program. The one remaining nuclear power plant, at Maanshan (a very nice surf spot as it happens) is more than 40 years old and would cost a fortune to keep running. Its contribution to overall Taiwanese energy use is pretty small. You can certainly argue that it was a serious mistake by Taiwan to opt for coal and gas instead of nuclear for its electricity, but that decision was made decades ago and would take further decades (and many billions of dollars) to reverse. Extending the operating licence for Maanshan would make very little difference. A much better bet for Taiwan would be investing in geothermal energy – the entire country is a major geothermal hotspot. What about a cable connection to the mainland? LOL A quick google search on Taiwan using geothermal came up with this “the island is very densely populated, and operational space is limited in many areas. In contrast, the less densely populated areas are very mountainous, which does not make a strong case for installing a rig either.” It goes on to be much more positive. United Airlines flight attendants stage a protest at the PR event launching a new business class seat. No contract in 5 years, lowest pay of major US airlines. Interesting to note that the 3 gulf carriers pay more than the US. @xJonNYC The FAs have their say at today’s UA new Polaris event They got arrested for trespassing. Hope they aren’t sent to El Salvador. >>>Boosting ICE budgets is bipartisan Polygraph I know that this view will be unpopular with the vast majority of the peeps… If you don’t like a law (eg, migration), repeal it. Selective enforcement is corrosive to society/govt legitimacy long-term. This term, your side doesn’t enforce migration laws. Next term, the other side stops enforcing environmental laws. “Ask for forgiveness (or look the other way), don’t ask for permission” (at all levels of society) is one of the 100 things destroying America’s social fabric. Be that as it may, the article in question is about the ICE BUDGET and the fact that it’s steady increases have been supported by both parties, regardless of who’s in power. So on THIS issue, the precise point is that “your side” and “their side” are the same, and that the alternation between parties makes no difference. I find the “Mission Creep” of ICE disturbing since all of us whose ancestors were not born here more than say, 500 years ago, are immigrants or the descendants of immigrants. With some not especially creative “lawyering” this extends the jurisdiction of ICE, shall we say, rather broadly. Would that be a feature or a bug? Also note, the border czar … I believe that is his moniker … Homan was quoted, when challenged about some of his actions, “I was only following orders.” That defense was definitively shot down during the Nuremberg Trials in 1946. I actually remember that, young though I was. Now you can question the Nuremberg trials and opn some grounds, I do. You can wonder why the borders have been wide open until you look at who hires and benefits from all that inexpensive labor. You can, as I did at the time, see the Patriot Act as among the worst of bad laws, and I do. Why you might ask? Did 17 or 27 …however many “intelligence” agencies there are … need another layer of bureaucracy troweled on top of them? I think not. Was the creation of national police forces … think ICE and others … never stop with just one … necessary? Depends on what plans, hopes, dreams, schemes, you have for them. As to your general points, could not agree more. What once was a government has become a shambles. Shambles: among whose definitions are disorder, ruin, clutter jumble and mess and finally a place of bloodshed or carnage. The OED would note it once referred to a slaughterhouse. (Apologies for the pedantic aside) The absence of long term planning or of follow through in the face of partisan one-up-man-ship, dueling lobbyists, and showers of “campaign contributions” in pursuit of access has reduced the DC Bubble and Echo Chamber to sound and silliness in pursuit of perpetuity in office by the unambitious and perpetuity in office and a small to medium fortune for the more bright eyed. But my cynicism overflows or is it realism? The result is visible this day as The Don as styled by Gay Talese in The Godfather, cavorts about the Arab states being showered with cash in one form or another ostensibly for public purposes, while his offspring and other relations hustle for the various family businesses. In the world of William Gibson’s The Peripheral this is called a Klept … you can look it up. Realism? Cynicism? Folly? Fantasy? Take you choice, but keep an eye on ICE. It’s not that your view is unpopular exactly it’s that it derives from what I believe is nostalgic unreality. Selective enforcement is the very nature of law in this country, has long been, and will ever be. The facade of rule of law has in my view largely been sundered not by the actual cavalier character of government (again, it was ever thus, sovereign is he who decides on the state of exception) but rather by the incredible diversity of media coverage possible in the 21st century which allows the sufficiently politically conscious to view every conceivable angle of policy and identify hypocrisies and inconsistencies at a level of granularity previously reserved for dedicated scholars. Indeed even the comparatively politically narcoleptic now live in such demographically stratified infospaces that it’s perfectly impossible not to perceive the comparative lawlessness of their political opposite. We once – before my lifetime so I take this as an article of faith – had a monoculture in news media that was capable of weaving a coherent throughline between any number of acts of brazen extralegal fiat such that the American public could digest it all. That is certainly not the case now and I cannot conceive of it ever being so again. Indeed, selective law enforcement is a common feature of all unfree societies where a few people rule over everyone else and forbid people from upholding their own laws. In free societies, everyone is expected to agree on and uphold their own laws and thus there are not exceptions like this. What Ironic is saying is true – it’s better to have societies where everyone agrees on rules that work for everybody. Otherwise people just argue over whose rules and enforcement preferences dominate. And of course the rich usually get their way. great, timely piece by historian Zachary Foster: https://palestinenexus.com/articles/jewish-antizionism It is a good overview, although slanted towards the English-speaking Jewish world in its last section: there is almost nothing about the current attitude of European (or South American) Jews towards zionism. I also found two intriguing articles by the same author on that site: How Zionists Prevented Jewish Refugees From Returning Home After WWII and Was Zionism about Rescuing Jews Fleeing Persecution? No. A further article confirms my earlier impression that the staunch support of Israel by the likes of Sunak, Meloni, Macron, Biden, Scholz, etc, is not due to any strategic advantage (economic, military, geographic, or otherwise), but because Israel is the country where Western countries, where antisemitism is latent, especially in right-wing circles, can dump their Jewish population. And if this happens to the detriment of Arabs, so what? “US Hypocrisy on Terrorism Reaches New Heights, While Trump Signals a Welcomed Shift in US Foreign Policy” I thought that Larry Johnson would be more stirred up about Trump with meeting Syria’s Jolani. That guy is basically an al-Qaeda leader and until recently had a $10 million bounty on his head by the US government. So I can see it now. Trump enters the room to meet Jolani who comes in with a trimmed beard, polished shoes, an expensive Rolex and a bespoke suit. The cameras are rolling for this historic event. Trump thinks to himself at least this is one leader that does not go around wearing t-shirts. As Jolani gets closer, he rips his jacket open to reveal sticks of dynamite, shouts ‘Allahu Akbar’ before hugging Trump, then BOOM! Can you imagine? US’ side of the Shi’a-Sunni schism! Sunni terrorists, sustained by USA since 1980’s are the good guys. Trump in KSA is renewing US pledge to Arabian peninsula Wahabbi. As long as Sunnis in charge Israel is safe. Sell them new anti missile shield, golden dome for Medina! It’s really not the Sunnis at large but specifically Wahhabi Takfiri fighters funded by the Gulf despots and supported by US/Israeli deep state. They’ve been at it since 1970s Afghanistan, kicked it up a notch in the Balkans and then Chechyna, then Uyghurs, Iraq, Lybia, Syria, etc. Associating these predominantly Muslim murdering freaks with the bulk of Muslims is like associating Christian Zionists in Congress with all Christians. I think that Trump’s speech in Saudi Arabia is perhaps the best I’ve seen give him. To be honest I can’t recall a better speech from a US president. Among items strengths, he’s gracious to the hosts, rather than lecturing them as other Western leaders like Biden or Baerbock would do. He’s acknowledging real strengths in the hosts, which is they built up gleaming cities, that they’re probably proud of themselves. He’s acknowledging real failures at home, the trillions wasted on Baghdad on Kabul and nation building there. Those cities would be better off without US nation building. And finally it reflects real recent policy changes. They’re lifting the idiotic sanctions on Syria and they ended the idiotic attacks on Yemen. Honestly, I think a large percentage of the influence is how well they dress. And they let him touch the orb. He really enjoyed that! Agreed on the speech, but let’s see where he goes with it. On Syria, give a leg up to US’ “refined” terrorists. If IDF can kill Gazans new Syrian allies can kill non SUnni. Keeping in mind that Obama received a Nobel Peace Prize (2009) for making speeches and without making positive actions toward peace, I would say that Trump was following in Obama’s footsteps, considering one of Trump’s goals is receiving a Nobel. I’m afraid that starting a trade war with China, bombing civilians in Yemen, threatening Iran with a full-fledged attack, helping Israel commit a genocide in Gaza and keeping the war in the Ukraine going is not going to get him that Nobel peace prize. Not even if he regifts the Qatari jet to the Nobel committee? As proven by how they gave a Nobel to Obama before he even did anything, they are a cheap date. If I recall correctly, he did bomb the Moon. Perhaps we should encourage Trump to take still more bribes from the Arab countries if it means a correction of the long standing and senseless policy of favoring the 9 1/2 million Jewish Israelis over the triple digit millions who surround them. After all there has long been plenty of campaign bribery going on to further the anti Arab cause. In his recent talk with Judge Nap Alastair Crooke points out that the Cold War excuse for our ME policy was to keep the Soviets out of the Middle East. But the Cold War–mostly also senseless–is over despite neocons trying to revive it. FDR favored the Arabs while still asking them to accept Zionism. Truman on the other hand defied the advice of his State Department by siding with Israel. This policy mistake engendered all that has followed. At this point Israel isn’t going anywhere but for their own good someone needs to introduce them to reality. > he’s gracious to the hosts Because he wants $40 oil. Trump is a salesman. > lifting the idiotic sanctions on Syria Abu Mohammed al-Jolani was a most wanted terrorist a few month ago. Now that he is in charge, so no more sanctions. Trump is no different, he is just doing “it” differently. The Don was being polite for a change, but he respects wealth and glitter, besides it costs nothing. In this case one can quote the nameless person who said of a political speech, “He talks purty, don’t he.” Obama rode “talkin’ purty” to the presidency then betrayed all, almost all(?) of his promises right out the gate. The Don wants a Nobel Peace prize because Obama received one and, i am convinced,The Don has never forgiven Obama for mocking him at the Press Club(?) dinner in DC in 2011. Vengeful persons neither forget nor forgive. Take this however you will. Churchill is quoted as saying, “When you are going to kill a man, it costs nothing to be polite.” It is irritating to praise Trump for something like this but you’re not wrong if just regarding the content of the speech itself. Actually, more than irritating, it’s mortifying that this level of graciousness – what I would describe as completely reasonable and expected etiquette when one is a guest – is something laudable in the Western context. We’re grading on a frankly embarrassing curve. Trump’s speech suggested to me that the last person he spoke with before getting off the plane was Tulsi Gabbard. If so, good for both of them. I found this to be an interesting thread dissecting what Trump was banging on about … between Arnaud Bertrand and below commenter. Amine Idriss @amibiaka · 19h Arnaud, I see what you’re pointing to — but let’s not kid ourselves. Trump’s speech isn’t a breakthrough in appreciating civilizational diversity. It’s a classic expression of his white nationalist worldview, dressed up as respect for sovereignty. https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1922443275526668625 Arnaud’s core argument is – “Regarding Trump’s speech in Saudi, some see it as a refreshing break from liberal hypocrisy. I see it as something more dangerous, the normalization of a neo-mercantilist worldview. And that’s not a nostalgic return to realism; it’s a revival of the very ideology that once justified conquest, colonization, and the commodification of entire peoples. People in the West today complain about migration, as if it’s an invasion. But most of those who migrate to the West are fleeing the long-term consequences of Western imperialism, of resource extraction, of wars fought for oil or influence, of economic systems designed to benefit a few and impoverish the many. This doesn’t mean illegal immigration should be glorified. But let’s be honest: I have no sympathy for anti-immigrant rhetoric when it comes from the descendants of those who directly benefited from colonial plunder and racial capitalism.” – snip It seems to me that multipolarity is not unlike a global shit in the magnetic field, fluxes, and then bang it changes. How networks of power position themselves for it, with a side of climate change, is a sight to behold, as such I highly discount anything coming from Anglophone camp[see above] and especially anything coming from disingenuous Trump/camp[self serving]. “PM Modi Elaborates on S-400 Missile System’s Importance For India’s Air Defence: Why They Matter Now More Than Ever” How long until the US orders India to get rid of those S-400s because it is against US law for them to own them. And then to tell India to buy inferior Patriot batteries instead – which don’t exist at the moment – and to buy hundreds if not thousands of Patriot battery missiles – which have not even been manufactured yet. If India is lucky, they should get those Patriot batteries & missiles by 2040. You think that Pakistan will wait? The US doesn’t have that level of control over India. Might change in the future, but India is an important part of trying to contain China and because it has a conflict with China it also has more incentives to maintain relations with Russia. The Turks are much more vulnerable to pressure and have less reasons to keep Russia on side. India already has a domestic Patriot equivalent (medium range, up to around 150km), the Barak 8, which is jointly produced with Israel. Earlier reports indicated that India bought the S-400 specifically for the purposes of providing air defence over its borders with China – hence range and anti-stealth capability is particularly important. The recent possible failures in conflict with Pakistan may result in a rethink about where they are deployed. Mixing two separate systems is not considered good practice in air defence, so its a curious decision – presumably they have fallen behind in producing a Barak with the range to match the S-400. The big question, presumably well pondered by the Russians and Israelis, is how they stop each side getting access to key operational and technical inside information. If the systems can talk to each other – even if it be trough a third system – then it’s fine and dandy. Something akin to not having all your eggs in the same basket. But if the systems are isolated enough to basically fight alone, then they’re out-dated and handicapped even before they go operational. Allegedly Iran can take pretty much any air-defense system and make it work with their command, control, communication & situational awareness (C3/SA) network for air defense. “Illinois governor is first in US to block federal access to personal data on autism” Hey, Pritzker, why not block federal access to all personal data? Fourth amendment, anyone? Or does it apply only to corporate persons now? It’s funny how someone(s) is positioning/astroturfing Pritzker (billionaire, Dem. Machine scion) as a potential “Resistance” leader-2028 contender, see Jimmy Kimmel visit and Pritzker’s name popping up in random WaPo-NYt mentions. With friends like elite Democrats, who needs Republicans?! Pritzker, Slotkin and Buttigieg! Who says Ds don’t have a bench? (With JB, it had better be a sturdy one unless his consultants put him on Ozempic) Well, if the DemParty were to have a genuine democratic free Republican-quality primary for the first time in many years, we could see what shakes out. Or even get a vote on what shakes out. If . . . . No more down that path for me. I’m a veteran of McGovern in a small way, and recall how the Democrat Party not just abandoned a candidate, but actively allied against him. “Geonomics, nationalism and trade” This is why I decry the entire project to manufacture a divorce in the original term “political economy” into supposed “sciences” of each, an achievement of the unholy alliance of the marginalist school (Alfred Marshall being the foremost cementer of the ideas of Jevons, Menger and Walras) in economics and their Gilded Age funders in banking. It’s harmless enough in microeconomics, but intellectually lethal in macroeconomics — because in the latter “the politics never really went away.” It’s also why wherever international business investment went, gunboats inevitably followed … 🤨 “Qatar’s $400M jet for Trump is a gold-plated security nightmare” It doesn’t have to be. Trump could lease that 747 Jumbo jet back from the US government for a dollar a month while the government picks up the tab for the running expenses. He then announces that all those that own one of his Trump meme coins can go into a lottery to get a flight aboard this Jumbo jet for an hour or two. People would go out and buy & register one like they would with lottery tickets, especially MAGA supporters. Those that win would pay a $50 fee but that would be seen as cheap for a Trump flight and there would be no security issues at all. And is this so different to when recently top buyers of his coin could get a dinner with him? https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/12/top-buyers-trump-cryptocurrency-dinner It’s kind of amusing how even given Trump’s famously lax definition of ‘national security threats’ (the opioid crisis, illegal immigration, countries running a trade surplus with the US, the continued existence of Canada/Greenland as independent nations…) a Presidential plane supplied by a foreign power somehow doesn’t make the list. If you get behind on your payments on your Tesla, they can auto- drive your car back to the dealership. Makes me speculate that if Tesla can do that – then they could auto-drive your car off a cliff or into a pole if you don’t agree with Musk politics…..just speculating ya know – maybe a fun little sci-fi – a little data integration with siri, doorbells and all sorts of smart devices combined along with digital currency and Homeland security and police fusion centers…… why you could deport anybody you want with a self driving cab or car instead of iconviniencing ICE and the courts….you could knock off any opposition and disapear people at will….erase their identity and digital footprint or frame someone easy-peasy………..who needs to mess with that constitution or laws etc. Sounds about rite for the duopoly’s vision for Making America Great Again and Defending democracy…… I just wish they would tell me for whom they are defending democracy for and, for whom are they making America great Brings to mind the death of Michael Hastings, the journalist who got General Stanley McChrystal fired. During the morning’s brief channel surfing, I came across Andrew Ross Sorkin and Becky Quick lamenting the decline of ethics over the past couple of decades. For answers, they turned with all seriousness to their guest, Stanley McChrystal. Don’t change before the Empire falls. You’ll laugh so hard, you’ll crack the walls. Sometimes, I just miss the days when satire was a thing and not reality. Yes, I’ve kind of come to the conclusion that it woulnt matter whether Trump or some other clown was in the White House, we really are screwed. Trump just showed us the true nature of things. These tech billionaires own us and there is really nothing that can be done about it. Any of these jack asses, could set anyone up for a fall. And frankly with very little effort or evidence. And just who is gonna do anything About it? Anyone that thinks the courts or the press or the political class will help is deluded. Trump will have his plane, the USPS will be privatized, Social Security and medicare too. It’s all gone, along with our so called democracy. It done. That picture from Saudi Arabia was our future. Along with the list of billionaires. They own it and there nothing we can do about it. The democracy they are defending is the facade for what making America great again means. Simply great and democratic for them, not us. RE: “…they could auto-drive your car off a cliff or into a pole if you don’t agree with [insert elite name here] politics…” Very true! And you might enjoy the Terra Ignota scifi series where self-flying cars are a major plot point. Excerpt from the wiki entry – “The Six-Hive Transport System is a global network of flying cars, the primary mode of transportation in the series. They are fast enough to circle the globe in less than 4.2 hours, made possible by Cartesian set-sets. Mukta was the prototype car made in 2073 and now resides in the Saneer-Weeksbooth home. Utopia [a political faction] operates its own car system, separate to the primary one used in the series. The Utopian system is slightly slower than the primary one, but has 100% fewer accidents.” You will have to read the series (or at least the first two books which are great – the latter two are subpar) to find out why one political faction refuses to use the global transportation system. Suffice it to say that after reading the series, I will never be getting into any driverless car. Cars themselves will drive to the police station on detecting a non-white person in the driver’s seat? Regarding Guantanamo being re-purposed as a prison for migrants: Obama, when refusing to pursue criminal investigations against torture and other criminal acts at Guantanamo and elsewhere, said it was time to “look forward, not backward.” We now have a much clearer idea of what he meant. “RFK Jr. is full of crap” Somehow, looking at the images of RFK jr. taking his grandkids to go swim in those polluted waters, I am reminded of that 1975 film “Jaws.” The scene where people were on the beach but were not going into the water because of the recent shark attack. That is, until the local official leans on some older people to go into the water and when they do, they take their very young grandchildren with them into those waters. Don’t know why I thought of that old film… “Trump envoys Witkoff and Kellogg to go to Turkey for Russia-Ukraine talks, sources say” Those talks are going to go nowhere. Zelensky is trying to turn it into a media stunt by daring Putin to go there but what would they talk about? Zelenski’s 10-point peace plan? Kellogg, whose plan Trump has adopted, hopes Putin turns up. Even I know that negotiations don’t work that way and it is only after everything is settled that you call in the leaders to sign the agreements. Trump made himself sound like an idiot by indicting that he might just drop in to any meeting. Everybody knows that Presidents on Air Force One just drop in on random visits to countries from time to time to do a bit of shopping and maybe to pick up a pizza. The only reason why they want Putin there is to give him an ultimatum to freeze the conflict or else. Maybe even do to him what Trump and Vance did to Zelenski in that White House meeting several weeks ago. And Kellogg and others have said that as soon as there is a freeze, that they will flood the Ukraine with troops from at least four NATO nations. Looks like this war is going to be decided on the battlefield as Trump only wants negotiations so that Russia wins the war but loses the peace. And as it is now no longer Biden’s war but Trump’s war, the failure is all going to be on him. And all those neocons like Lindsay Graham will pretend that they were not pushing him but will blame Trump for not trying hard enough and which the media will go along with. I do not recall Witkoff or Kellogg being invited. Why send two persons with opposing views in the first place? Lavrov should, politely, tell them to bugger off. Trump should pull a page from Teddy Roosevelt. Invite Russia and Kiev to come to Portsmouth, NH. June is very nice in New England and the hotel from 1905 has been updated. The space at the shipyard may need polish. Bretton Woods is nice, too. “How Joe Biden Handed the Presidency to Donald Trump” Let us treat this as the New Yorker’s bid for the Most Embarrassing Blame Deflection Award for 2025 (wittier name pending). At the moment the only other candidate is that ludicrous New York Times article which apparently informed us that Russia would’ve been roundly defeated in the special military operation but for the intransigence, incompetence, and possibly incontinence of the Ukrainian military brass; the academy is therefore actively seeking other submissions, as unsealing an envelope for a 50/50 chance isn’t nearly enough fun. When are we going to get the Pulitzer Award for Gaslighting? Or is that the standard Pulitzer nowadays? Oh I hate Donald Trump—-but hold my beer as I do everything in my power to get him re-elected! btw have your beer prices gone up? In my lovely native Bavaria hops harvest has serious shortages due to lack of water. Gooooooood Mooooooooorning Fiatnam! In the fetid QWERTY jungle online where the numismatrix plied its traits, it was all about the skill-ratio, if you could turn a lone greenback into 30 bucks vis a vis crypto, it was a lot better than being stuck with the pyramid scheme on the back of a FRN, and why doesn’t that eagle on the right have a phalanx of old glories behind it, with an artificial breeze fanning them? Regarding the Notes on the Crisis article on “Can China “Buy” America?”: in the 1980s I was tracking mergers and acquisitions as part of a group investigating how dirty money, after being laundered and brought back into the US, was buying up control of established companies. Back then, the major “public” worry was over the Japanese and what they would do with their rapidly growing trade surpluses. But the numbers on dollar amounts of mergers and acquisitions showed a much different reality. By far the largest amount in m&a was by “investors” from Britian and the British empire members of Australia and Canada. The Brits were usually at least three times larger than the Japanese. I was not surprised when legal probes a few years later identified HSBC (then known by its original imperial moniker the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank) as one of the largest launderers of dirty money. HSBC — the infamous Hong Shang — of course, was originally established to process the revenue of the British opium trade out of China. “Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose,” The UK was a major legitimate investor abroad in the 80’s and the pool of safe countries for FDI.was much smaller. I don’t think the figures were directionally affected by corruption (but BCCI might have been part of it…). In HSBC’s defence, though, their crime was to purchase the extremely dodgy Republic Bank from Edmund Safra, which had a major NYC oresence and apparently zero KYC and AML controls! The US regulator fined them (HSBC) USD 12bn in exchange for a non-admission of guilt plea but in reality they inherited the crimes! Republic under Safra was suspected of tax evasion but also of other illegitimacies, in part because nobody could understand how low margin lending to governments and to physical goods trade could generate the profits claimed, especially when Republic employed very little leverage. The implication is that it was earning a vig on whatever its clients were doing. Given that Safra: – started out in physical shipments of cast. – was a Syrian-Lebanese New – lent to a lot of governments Safra died in a mysterious fire at his Monaco penthouse that was later judged arson…. PS: It is not surprising that fingers were pointed at Iran-contra type deals and drug money, a but like Alan Stanford. Here is an article very lamely pretending these was nothing crooked in public but leaving a trail of breadcrumbs. but it is not hard to read between the lines. https://www.timesofisrael.com/new-biography-probes-into-mysterious-backstory-of-billionaire-banker-edmond-j-safra/ Hunter Biden must be green with envy, the Biden’s only managed to Grift about $23MM total while the Donald’s Family has cleared well over $100MM from crypto alone and if you add the $400MM jet they are averaging better than $125MM a Month. In other happy news regular Gas is at $5.29 per Gallon, cash price at the local 76 station. That’s quite something to be able to gamble on the temperature of a city on a given day, why bother with mundane casinos? Gambling was fairly forbidden a century ago, and now nothing related to gambling is forbidden… heck, a couple of ballplayers who blackened the diamond by one throwing the world series for a gambler, and the other who gambled on games, were reinstated in the MLB yesterday, never mind. Taiwan is playing with darkness by abandoning nuclear power Intellinews The Japanese prefecture of Fukushima is about 5,000 square miles in area, and remains mostly an abandoned area a decade after the reactor meltdown in the prefecture. I assume this will not change for another couple of hundred thousand years. The island of Taiwan is about 13,000 square miles in area, or perhaps two and a half times the size of the Fukushima prefecture. A single reactor catastrophe there on the scale of Fukushima will therefore, to a first approximation, make a half to a third of the island uninhabitable. It’s very easy to see why Taiwan is getting rid of nuclear power as fast as they can, though it doesn’t seem to be as fast as one would like. The mystery is why Japan isn’t doing the same thing. On the other hand, if Taiwan were converted into a nuclear wasteland, China and the US could stop fighting about its future and everyone could relax. I guess there really is a silver lining to every cloud. Fukushima Prefecture was wholly inappropriately abandoned. More people died from moving, upheaval and, in those who stayed, abandonment than could ever die of anthropogenic radiation exposure, especially in an elderly farming population. Sorry if this is a dumb question, was that incident really as dramatic as it was pictured in our (European) media or was it exaggerated or possibly even underplayed. For those curious, I took my avatar name here from the mascot of the Fukushima nuclear plant. For some strange reason they eliminated all reference to him from the internet around about 2011. It’s very hard to get a real grip on the true extent of damage, not least because the Japanese are very good at message control (aided by their ability to keep foreign experts at bay). The extreme radiation was very localised, and thankfully not much went airborne, unlike with Chernobyl. So Revenant is correct to say that the overall direct threat to anyone further than a few miles from the plant was pretty low – but certainly not negligible. But it is still a gigantic ticking bomb which will take many years of control to prevent any kind of chain reaction that could restart a reactor fire, or a major release of radioactivity to the sea (bioconcentration in seafood is ultimately a much bigger human health threat than airborne release). This is one (not the only) reason Taiwan then mothballed its new nuke plants. Taiwan is even more seismically active than Japan and prone to very extreme natural disasters. The scale of the Typhoons that regularly hit the island have to be seen to be believed. It complicates everything. Thanks. I remember that Fukushima was “used” by the Merkel administration to pull off their no-alternatives no-NPPs plan. So we now have basically no leeway in terms of energy production. Back then I argued with colleagues that regarding emissions by various sources it ought to be looked into the matter scientifically. Not ideologically. While that appears a very beginner´s approach for NC I bumped into some heavy resistance. As usual…thinking of the public atmosphere in those days – some even made movies about it… it´s the same insane, unreflected blind trust by the elite in their own media products. Self-serving, self-affirming, circular flow of information. Not much has changed since. Actually I wonder when was the period that this bubble-think became standard and dominant. So that Fukushima could be replaced by any other term. Of course those same circlces don´t even know any more what Fukushima is today. And these are often not bad people. It seriously upsetting Tons and tons of intensely radioactive congealed corium from three reactors is still stuck in the ground below the plants and will continue indefinitely to contaminate ground water. https://dunrenard.wordpress.com/2018/01/28/the-corium-of-reactor-2-of-fukushima-daiichi-is-clearly-visible/ FINALLY! I have been wondering for so many years where PlutoniumKun came from, it sounded Japanese but I wasn’t sure Trump takes a blow torch to the neocons and interventionists while speaking to the Saudis. I am no great admirer of Trump, but I challenge you to find a previous American president who would have said anything remotely similar to what Trump was saying here. Sounds like Noam Chomsky could have written this. Unfortunately, the overall effect was kind of ruined by the fact that on the same trip, he was selling US weaponry out the wazoo. But still… Franklin Delano Roosevelt?! The good neighbour idea? Are the Turks copying Israel with their effort to split PKK? Is Ocalan becoming an Arafat in old age? Are we oing to have a Hamas-PKK and a Fatah/PA-PKK? More like a parliamentary Sinn-Fein-PKK and an extra-parliamentary Provisional-PKK ? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army Six cheetah cubs! I can only think at how many will survive! Heroine mother that one, all by herself… Heroic Mother of the Cheetah Soviet Union, First Class! Although they all look so peeved in that photo, I wonder if they had substantial investments in Tesla or something . . . re: llamas I was mistyping an internet address and ended up with writing “cria” into google. As it turns out that is actually a scientific term derived from the Spanish word for “baby” also describing young specimen of llamas. See Wiki: Etymology The term comes from the Spanish word cría, meaning “baby”. Its false cognate in English, crya (pronounced /ˈkraɪə/), was coined by British sailors who explored Chile in the 18th century and were quick to describe the camelids onomatopoeically according to the mwa sound they made, which was not unlike that of a human crying baby. On the X post “we’ve really decided to let people gamble on the specific temperature…” How do you determine a specific temperature of any town? This seems like a big “So what?” to me. If you check ambientweather.net you’ll see most towns have a pretty wide variance in temps. For example, in the town I live in today right now at 1:00PM, the temperature varies by at least 6F from one side to the other re: US elites instrumentalizing anti-racism JACOBIN The Trouble With Equity By Jennifer C.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. FORT MONMOUTH, NEW JERSEY - MAY 13: Phil Murphy speaks onstage during the Fort Monmouth ... More Groundbreaking Ceremony on May 13, 2025 in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. (Photo by Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images for Netflix) Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares have been exceptionally successful this year, climbing approximately 25% since the beginning of January and trading close to $1,100 each. This increase can be attributed to several factors. Netflix’s financial results have been robust, driven by subscriber growth from lower-priced ad-supported plans, enforcement against password sharing, and rising advertising revenues. In Q1 2025, Netflix’s revenues surpassed projections, growing 13% to reach $10.54 billion, while earnings increased by 25% to $6.61 per share. The company has also successfully raised prices without encountering significant pushback from clients. In late January, the cost of its standard plan rose to around $18 monthly, while the premium plan increased to about $25 per month. Thus, does Netflix stock still offer good value? We believe that the stock appears appealing yet volatile, making it a challenging choice to purchase at its current price of approximately $1110. We think there are several reasons for concern regarding NFLX stock, which renders it attractive yet highly susceptible to negative events, given that its current valuation is very high. We reach our conclusion by assessing the current valuation of NFLX stock in relation to its operational performance over the past few years, along with its present and historical financial status. Our evaluation of Netflix based on key metrics of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience indicates that the company demonstrates a very strong operational performance and financial standing, as explained below. Nonetheless, if you seek growth with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio provides an alternative – having outpaced the S&P 500 and delivered returns surpassing 91% since its launch. Considering what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, NFLX stock appears very pricey when contrasted with the overall market. • Netflix has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 12.3 compared to 2.8 for the S&P 500 • Furthermore, the company's price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) ratio is 65.3, in contrast to 17.6 for the S&P 500 • Additionally, it maintains a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 55.2 compared to the benchmark's 24.5 Netflix’s Revenues have significantly increased over the past few years. • Netflix has experienced its top line increase at an average rate of 9.6% over the last 3 years (versus a 6.2% increase for S&P 500) • Its revenues have grown 15.6% from $35 billion to $40 billion in the last 12 months (compared to a growth of 5.3% for S&P 500) • In addition, its quarterly revenues grew 16.0% to $11 billion in the most recent quarter from $9.4 billion a year earlier (versus a 4.9% improvement for S&P 500) Netflix’s profit margins are greater than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. • Netflix’s Operating Income over the last four quarters was $10 billion, representing a high Operating Margin of 26.7% (compared to 13.1% for S&P 500) • Netflix’s Operating Cash Flow (OCF) during this timeframe was $7.4 billion, signifying a moderate OCF Margin of 18.9% (compared to 15.7% for S&P 500) • Over the last four-quarter interval, Netflix’s Net Income was $8.7 billion – indicating a high Net Income Margin of 22.3% (compared to 11.3% for S&P 500) Netflix’s balance sheet appears very robust. • Netflix’s Debt was $16 billion at the conclusion of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization stands at $474 billion (as of 5/12/2025). This suggests a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 3.2% (compared to 21.5% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is preferred] • Cash (inclusive of cash equivalents) constitutes $8.4 billion of the $52 billion in Total Assets for Netflix. This results in a strong Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 17.9% (compared to 15.0% for S&P 500) NFLX stock has experienced a slightly better impact than the benchmark S&P 500 index during several recent downturns. Concerned about how a market crash might affect NFLX stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Netflix Stock Go In A Market Crash? features a comprehensive analysis of how the stock has performed during and after past market crashes. • NFLX stock dropped 75.9% from a peak of $691.69 on 17 November 2021 to $166.37 on 11 May 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock completely recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 20 August 2024 • Since then, the stock has risen to a high of $1,156 on 4 May 2025 and currently trades at approximately $1110 • NFLX stock declined 22.9% from a peak of $387.78 on 18 February 2020 to $298.84 on 16 March 2020, versus a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock completely recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 13 April 2020 • NFLX stock decreased 55.9% from a peak of $5.81 on 17 April 2008 to $2.56 on 27 October 2008, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 17 March 2009 In conclusion, Netflix’s performance based on the metrics highlighted above is as follows: • Growth: Extremely Strong • Profitability: Strong • Financial Stability: Extremely Strong • Downturn Resilience: Neutral • Overall: Very Strong Therefore, despite its extremely high valuation, the stock stands out as appealing yet volatile, reaffirming our conclusion that NFLX is a difficult stock to purchase. Concerned about the unpredictable nature of NFLX stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has demonstrated a history of comfortably surpassing the S&P 500 over the past 4-year interval. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with lower risk relative to the benchmark index, resulting in a smoother investment experience as evidenced by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Despite A History Of Bribery And Corruption Among Top Shareholders, The World’s Largest Meatpacker Prepares To Go Public

ByChloe Sorvino ByChloe Sorvino, Forbes Staff. The Brother Lode: Billionaires Joesley (left) and Wesley Batista are the top shareholders of JBS, the world's largest meatpacker, which the SEC recently greenlit to be listed on the NYSE. After a decade-long beef with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as bipartisan opposition in Congress, JBS, the world’s largest meatpacker, was finally given the green light in late April to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The U.S. listing of the Brazil-based JBS has been delayed several times over the past decade due to a deluge of scandals involving the top shareholders and their holding company—including bribes to Brazilian meat inspectors, kickbacks to government financiers and illegal campaign contributions to more than 1,800 Brazilian politicians. That is in addition to accusations in the U.S. of JBS and companies it owns price-fixing, wage-manipulating and violating child labor laws, plus allegations of discrimination and harassment. Joesley and Wesley Batista, 53 and 52 respectively, are the company’s largest shareholders through their holding company J&F Investimentos. The brothers, whom Forbes estimates are worth $4.8 billion each, have also been personally charged with foreign corruption in the U.S. as well as insider trading allegations in Brazil (related to the timing of the news of their bribery scheme) that saw them briefly jailed for about six months from 2017 to 2018. Any one of those issues would have ended most other companies’ prospects of going public on the American market, but following the SEC’s recent decision, JBS is looking to offer shares on the New York Stock Exchange in June, pending a shareholder vote later this month. “This time it looks like it’s for real,” says Carlos Laboy, a managing director who heads up Latin American food coverage including JBS at HSBC, which is not involved in the listing. Over the past two decades, the Batista brothers have turned their family’s South American meat business into a goliath with more than $77 billion in annual revenue with a presence in nearly every country in the world. Its major U.S. brands include Swift, Pilgrim’s Pride, Primo, Blue Ribbon and Certified Angus Beef. But given the mountain of scandals, U.S. politicians from both sides of the aisle have long been opposed to the company going public in America. Just last year, at 15 senators—including Republicans Josh Hawley of Missouri and John Barrasso of Wyoming as well as Democrats Cory Booker of New Jersey, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts—denounced a potential IPO. For years, former Florida Senator Marco Rubio, now Secretary of State, was one of JBS’ loudest critics. In 2019 Rubio requested an investigation by a Treasury Department committee into JBS’s acquisitions, and in 2021, he renewed the ask and broadened it to the approximately 250 meat and agribusiness companies owned by the Batista family’s holding company J&F Investimentos. The Treasury Department declined to comment. “It probably behooves the U.S. authorities to have JBS listed on the New York Stock Exchange because it increases the regulatory oversight.” But the Batistas’ fortune changed when Donald Trump retuned to the White House in January. The long-delayed SEC approval for JBS’ dual-listing came just two days after it was revealed in a public filing with the federal election commission that the largest donor to the Trump Inaugural Committee was the JBS subsidiary, chicken processor Pilgrim’s Pride. The $5 million donation to Trump’s Inauguration was five times larger than the checks given by Amazon, Meta, Uber, Nvidia and Microsoft, which each gave $1 million. A JBS spokesperson denied any link in the timing of the donation: “No company has control over the timing of when inaugural committee donation contributions are publicized, and the JBS listing has been underway for approximately two years. The company has internal controls and compliance procedures in place to ensure that all political contributions are made in a transparent and ethical manner, and in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations.” The spokesperson also declined to provide the names of executives at the Inauguration, only confirming “several executives attended inaugural events.” The representative declined to comment on whether JBS, Pilgrim’s Pride or any affiliates donated to the Trump Administration’s transition fund from last summer. In addition to the SEC approval, there have been other federal policy changes in President Trump’s first 100 days that have benefited JBS and the Batistas—most notably, the administration’s decision to stop enforcing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. That law, which dates back to 1977, prohibits U.S. companies (including subsidiaries owned by foreign companies), citizens, as well as foreigners acting in the U.S., from bribing officials in the U.S. or abroad. It had previously led to JBS parent company J&F Investimentos paying a $128 million criminal fine as part of a 2020 settlement with the Department of Justice in which J&F pleaded guilty to corruption charges. J&F also paid nearly $27 million over foreign corruption charges with the SEC in 2020. At the same time, the Batistas, who are Brazilian citizens, settled a civil penalty with the SEC and paid $550,000 each. JBS’ spokesperson says that the Trump Administration’s decision “didn’t change any of the obligations contained in J&F’s settlement, which have been fully complied with.” In terms of linking the SEC’s change of heart about JBS’ listing to donations to Trump’s inaugural, it’s difficult to prove a quid pro quo in court, says Brett Kappel, a campaign finance and government ethics attorney at the Washington, D.C. law firm Harmon Curran, and it’s unlikely a prosecutor would even take the case. “If there were a prosecution, the Justice Department would have to show that there was an agreement that government officials would do certain things in exchange for the contribution,” Kappel says. Although he adds, “the Justice Department could show through circumstantial evidence that the two things were linked. In our judicial system we trust juries to use their common sense to make those decisions." JBS denies any quid pro quo. “As a U.S.-based food company, Pilgrim’s Pride was pleased to support the 2025 inauguration ceremony,” the spokesperson says. “We have a long bipartisan history of participating in the civic process and look forward to working with the Administration to create opportunities for American farmers and provide safe, affordable food for American families.” JBS was founded in 1953 when then-19-year-old Jose Batista Sobrinho, the namesake of the company, began carving up oxen and selling the meat to locals around the family’s small farm in Anapolis, a rural region in Central Brazil. Joesley and Wesley were born into the family business as Brazilian beef started booming in the 1970s. The brothers dropped out of high school to work full-time for JBS, by then a major Brazilian meatpacker, which was then run by Jose Batista, their eldest brother. But in 2005, Jose left JBS for an ill-fated attempt at politics and Joesley and Wesley, then in their thirties, took over. They took JBS public at a valuation equivalent to $800 million on Brazil’s São Paolo-based B3 stock exchange in 2007, which was at the time the most successful debut in the history of its stock market. Soon after going public, the Batistas looked to supersize their business by taking JBS abroad. The Batistas, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission cease-and-desist order from 2020, were willing to buy their way in. According to his testimony to Brazilian investigators in 2017, Joesley had a network of government officials and politicians on his payroll, including a finance minister at the Brazilian development bank BNDES, who received kickbacks for helping finance acquisitions of American assets, including Pilgrim’s Pride. (BNDES, which also became JBS’ second-largest shareholder, has denied allegations of corruption and bribery, citing an independent investigation at the time that found no evidence. A Brazilian federal court also refused to charge JBS with a crime in connection with the bribery.) After Texas-based Pilgrim’s Pride went bankrupt, in 2009 the Batistas targeted America’s second-largest chicken processor, which they viewed as a bargain. For an initial 64% of the company, JBS spent $800 million. The deal had an enterprise value of $2.8 billion with BNDES providing $2 billion in financing. According to the DOJ indictment against J&F, the bribe Joesley Batista deposited into a U.S. bank account for the BNDES finance minister was more than $55 million. JBS eventually secured an estimated nearly $5 billion in total equity and debt financing from BNDES across several U.S. deals, including Pilgrim’s Pride. In all, the Batistas and J&F agreed to more than three dozen incidents of bribery in Brazil, according to their 2017 cooperation agreements with the Brazilian government. The DOJ and SEC found evidence of some $150 million in kickbacks. According to the SEC’s 2020 case against JBS, publicly traded Pilgrim’s Pride, which the Batistas eventually amassed an 80% stake in, even became a slush fund for the brothers: “From 2009 to 2015, unbeknownst to Pilgrim’s management, the [Batistas and J&F] carried out the bribery scheme and its funding using, at times, certain JBS operating accounts which contained funds that were commingled with funds obtained from Pilgrim’s through intercompany transfers, special dividend payments, and other means. Pilgrim’s books did not reflect this.” The scheme came crashing down when Brazilian investigators, in the middle of a sweeping country-wide corruption probe in 2017, had Joesley Batista wear a wire to snare the then-President of Brazil, Michel Temer, who Joesley alleged was on the Batistas’ payroll. On the recording, Temer can be heard discussing Joesley giving a bribe to another politician on Temer’s behalf. After the recording leaked, the Brazilian real tanked and there were massive street protests in Brazil. Despite their cooperation, the Batistas didn’t avoid jail time—they ended up serving about six months, starting in September 2017. And as these bribes, and other unrelated bribes to meat inspectors in Brazil, were revealed to the public, their attempts to list JBS in the U.S. were delayed. “There were some rocky years there,” says John Baumgarten, a managing director at Mizuho Group who covers food companies, including JBS. “They had to take a few steps backwards.” In addition to the extensive bribery scheme, JBS has also faced allegations of environmental damage, particularly that it knowingly buys cattle that have been raised on ranchland created by deforesting the Amazon. JBS’ spokesperson denies that, and says the company is “deeply committed to zero deforestation in our supply chain and are actively investing in sustainable agricultural practices. We continue to collaborate with our suppliers to promote responsible land use and reduce our shared environmental footprint.” But representatives of the Parakanã people in Brazil allege that JBS illegally exploited the Apyterewa Indigenous Territory in the rainforest by buying cattle raised on cleared acres. According to a letter sent to then-SEC chairman Gary Gensler in 2023 asking for the listing to be blocked, which was obtained by Forbes through a Freedom of Information Act request, community leader Wenatoa said “Our people suffer daily threats from invaders, and JBS is an accomplice in this invasion…We will not be silent as long as our lands, culture and dignity continue to be harmed by irresponsible business practices like this.” Now that the public listing is approved, it will give JBS access to U.S.-only investors, pensions and stock indices. The share price is expected to take off, with HSBC’s Laboy estimating JBS could double in value. That would give JBS “more resources to solve the environmental issues that need to be solved.” Overall, Laboy sees the listing as a way to rein in JBS. “It probably behooves the U.S. authorities to have JBS listed on the New York Stock Exchange because it increases the regulatory oversight,” he says. “More oversight of the market leader intensifies the regulatory pressure on bad behavior in the broader industry." Either way, the Batistas are not going anywhere. Once JBS is listed, the family holding companies, J&F and JBS Participações, which owns nearly 50% as the largest shareholder of JBS, will get the chance to convert its common shares to preferred, increasing the Batistas’ voting power to as much as 90%. While JBS declined to comment on the Batistas’ long-term plans, the move ensures that the family will be involved for years to come. Because of that family control, Laboy believes that “strong independent voices on the board of directors” are a must. But, as it stands, the board of directors under the NYSE-listed company will include Joesley and Wesley Batista, who were forced to leave the board when they were arrested in 2017. They had been banned from leadership roles for years but they both returned to management at J&F in 2020 after a Brazilian judge ordered it, and in 2024 they were both reelected to the JBS board. “A strong board with independent members of unquestionable integrity would be optimal for all shareholders of JBS,” Laboy adds, “including [the Batistas].”

Title: Microsoft hasn’t bowed to Trump — and the company is thriving

Ever since Donald J. Trump was re-elected president, we’ve witnessed a disheartening spectacle: big tech companies bending their knees to him, hoping to get him to kill antitrust actions against them and defend them from European Union rules and fines. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder and Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Apple CEO Tim Cook have all in one way or another shown or declared support for the president’s agenda, especially his opposition to DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) programs. Notably, all four attended his Jan. 20 inauguration and were front and center during the proceedings. Zuckerberg killed DEI efforts at Meta, abandoned attempts to contain misinformation on his services, makes regular pilgrimages to Mar-a-Lago, and called then-candidate Trump a “badass” after last year’s assassination attempt. He sounded like nothing so much as Trump himself (while using words of more than one syllable) when he told Joe Rogan on a podcast: “The corporate world is pretty culturally neutered. A culture that celebrates aggression a bit more has its own merits. Masculine energy, I think, is good.” Bezos killed DEI at Amazon. As the owner of The Washington Post he also squashed the newspaper’s endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris last fall, killed a cartoon of tech leaders and Mickey Mouse bowing down to Trump, and ruled that the paper’s editorial and opinion pages will become right-wing, covering only “personal liberty and free markets,” with no opposing viewpoints allowed. Pichai killed off DEI efforts at Google and makes regular visits to see Trump in Florida. Cook is a bit of an outlier — although he attended the inauguration, he didn’t kill DEI at Apple and has made noises about working with Trump on tariff issues. The four companies haven’t gotten anything (yet) for their efforts; legal action against them begun under Trump’s predecessor are proceeding. Google faces being broken up after a judge ruled it illegally monopolized the advertising tech market. Meta is being prosecuted for illegally monopolizing the social media market by buying Instagram and What’s App and could be broken up as well. Amazon has been charged by the FTC with protecting its online retail monopoly by imposing fees on third-party sellers and favoring its own services over theirs. Apple has been sued by the Department of Justice for a variety of antitrust actions in protecting and extending its monopoly in the smartphone market. And while Trump has made statements about EU regulators — the White House last month criticized recent fines against Meta and Apple as a “novel form of economic extortion” — but has done little to get the EU to halt its actions against the companies. Meanwhile, Microsoft not only won’t valorize Trump, it’s also pushing back against him. The company has publicly supported its DEI efforts rather than killing them. In December, the company’s Chief Diversity Officer, Lindsay-Rae McIntyr, wrote on LinkedIn that Microsoft’s DEI efforts are vital to the company’s success: “The business case for D&I [diversity and inclusion] is not only a constant, but is stronger than ever, reinforcing our belief that a diverse and inclusive workforce is crucial for innovation and success.” When worries surfaced that Trump might require American tech companies to suspend their cloud operations in Europe, or turn Europeans’ data over to the federal government as part of a trade war, Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith wrote in a blog post that he won’t turn over the data or suspend European cloud operations. In fact, he said the company is expanding them. He also said he would sue the Trump administration to protect them, if necessary. Two days after that, Microsoft dropped the big law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, which had agreed to give the administration $125 million in free legal work after threats from Trump. Microsoft hired Jenner & Block to take its place — and Jenner & Block sued the Trump administration instead of giving in to it. You might expect that after all that, Trump would have publicly attacked Microsoft or used the power of his office to go after the company. So far, that hasn’t happened. And unlike Meta, Apple, Google, and Amazon, Microsoft has thrived since Trump took office. Its stock price inched up from $434 a share just before Trump’s inauguration past $445 this week, while the share prices of the others have all declined, sometimes significantly. Along the way, Microsoft became the world’s most valuable company, with a market cap approaching $3.3 trillion. Gauging by the company’s most recent quarterly results, even better times may be ahead. The New York Times had this to say about the results: “Overall, Microsoft’s results showed unexpected strength in its business. Sales surpassed $70 billion, up 13% from the same period a year earlier. Profit rose to $25.8 billion, up 18%. The results far exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Despite the economic uncertainty, the company predicted more strength ahead, saying revenue would surpass $73 billion in the current quarter.” All that said, Microsoft is being investigated by the feds for possible antitrust violations having to do with AI and cloud computing. That investigation, like the others, wasn’t begun by the Trump administration; it was set in motion during the Biden administration. So far, Microsoft’s actions don’t appear to have had any effect on the suit — or the company. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shown that it’s possible for a company to maintain its values under Trump and thrive. Amazon, Apple, Google, and Meta should follow suit.

Title: Despite A History Of Bribery And Corruption Among Top Shareholders, The World’s Largest Meatpacker Prepares To Go Public

ByChloe Sorvino ByChloe Sorvino, Forbes Staff. The Brother Lode: Billionaires Joesley (left) and Wesley Batista are the top shareholders of JBS, the world's largest meatpacker, which the SEC recently greenlit to be listed on the NYSE. After a decade-long beef with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as bipartisan opposition in Congress, JBS, the world’s largest meatpacker, was finally given the green light in late April to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The U.S. listing of the Brazil-based JBS has been delayed several times over the past decade due to a deluge of scandals involving the top shareholders and their holding company—including bribes to Brazilian meat inspectors, kickbacks to government financiers and illegal campaign contributions to more than 1,800 Brazilian politicians. That is in addition to accusations in the U.S. of JBS and companies it owns price-fixing, wage-manipulating and violating child labor laws, plus allegations of discrimination and harassment. Joesley and Wesley Batista, 53 and 52 respectively, are the company’s largest shareholders through their holding company J&F Investimentos. The brothers, whom Forbes estimates are worth $4.8 billion each, have also been personally charged with foreign corruption in the U.S. as well as insider trading allegations in Brazil (related to the timing of the news of their bribery scheme) that saw them briefly jailed for about six months from 2017 to 2018. Any one of those issues would have ended most other companies’ prospects of going public on the American market, but following the SEC’s recent decision, JBS is looking to offer shares on the New York Stock Exchange in June, pending a shareholder vote later this month. “This time it looks like it’s for real,” says Carlos Laboy, a managing director who heads up Latin American food coverage including JBS at HSBC, which is not involved in the listing. Over the past two decades, the Batista brothers have turned their family’s South American meat business into a goliath with more than $77 billion in annual revenue with a presence in nearly every country in the world. Its major U.S. brands include Swift, Pilgrim’s Pride, Primo, Blue Ribbon and Certified Angus Beef. But given the mountain of scandals, U.S. politicians from both sides of the aisle have long been opposed to the company going public in America. Just last year, at 15 senators—including Republicans Josh Hawley of Missouri and John Barrasso of Wyoming as well as Democrats Cory Booker of New Jersey, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts—denounced a potential IPO. For years, former Florida Senator Marco Rubio, now Secretary of State, was one of JBS’ loudest critics. In 2019 Rubio requested an investigation by a Treasury Department committee into JBS’s acquisitions, and in 2021, he renewed the ask and broadened it to the approximately 250 meat and agribusiness companies owned by the Batista family’s holding company J&F Investimentos. The Treasury Department declined to comment. “It probably behooves the U.S. authorities to have JBS listed on the New York Stock Exchange because it increases the regulatory oversight.” But the Batistas’ fortune changed when Donald Trump retuned to the White House in January. The long-delayed SEC approval for JBS’ dual-listing came just two days after it was revealed in a public filing with the federal election commission that the largest donor to the Trump Inaugural Committee was the JBS subsidiary, chicken processor Pilgrim’s Pride. The $5 million donation to Trump’s Inauguration was five times larger than the checks given by Amazon, Meta, Uber, Nvidia and Microsoft, which each gave $1 million. A JBS spokesperson denied any link in the timing of the donation: “No company has control over the timing of when inaugural committee donation contributions are publicized, and the JBS listing has been underway for approximately two years. The company has internal controls and compliance procedures in place to ensure that all political contributions are made in a transparent and ethical manner, and in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations.” The spokesperson also declined to provide the names of executives at the Inauguration, only confirming “several executives attended inaugural events.” The representative declined to comment on whether JBS, Pilgrim’s Pride or any affiliates donated to the Trump Administration’s transition fund from last summer. In addition to the SEC approval, there have been other federal policy changes in President Trump’s first 100 days that have benefited JBS and the Batistas—most notably, the administration’s decision to stop enforcing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. That law, which dates back to 1977, prohibits U.S. companies (including subsidiaries owned by foreign companies), citizens, as well as foreigners acting in the U.S., from bribing officials in the U.S. or abroad. It had previously led to JBS parent company J&F Investimentos paying a $128 million criminal fine as part of a 2020 settlement with the Department of Justice in which J&F pleaded guilty to corruption charges. J&F also paid nearly $27 million over foreign corruption charges with the SEC in 2020. At the same time, the Batistas, who are Brazilian citizens, settled a civil penalty with the SEC and paid $550,000 each. JBS’ spokesperson says that the Trump Administration’s decision “didn’t change any of the obligations contained in J&F’s settlement, which have been fully complied with.” In terms of linking the SEC’s change of heart about JBS’ listing to donations to Trump’s inaugural, it’s difficult to prove a quid pro quo in court, says Brett Kappel, a campaign finance and government ethics attorney at the Washington, D.C. law firm Harmon Curran, and it’s unlikely a prosecutor would even take the case. “If there were a prosecution, the Justice Department would have to show that there was an agreement that government officials would do certain things in exchange for the contribution,” Kappel says. Although he adds, “the Justice Department could show through circumstantial evidence that the two things were linked. In our judicial system we trust juries to use their common sense to make those decisions." JBS denies any quid pro quo. “As a U.S.-based food company, Pilgrim’s Pride was pleased to support the 2025 inauguration ceremony,” the spokesperson says. “We have a long bipartisan history of participating in the civic process and look forward to working with the Administration to create opportunities for American farmers and provide safe, affordable food for American families.” JBS was founded in 1953 when then-19-year-old Jose Batista Sobrinho, the namesake of the company, began carving up oxen and selling the meat to locals around the family’s small farm in Anapolis, a rural region in Central Brazil. Joesley and Wesley were born into the family business as Brazilian beef started booming in the 1970s. The brothers dropped out of high school to work full-time for JBS, by then a major Brazilian meatpacker, which was then run by Jose Batista, their eldest brother. But in 2005, Jose left JBS for an ill-fated attempt at politics and Joesley and Wesley, then in their thirties, took over. They took JBS public at a valuation equivalent to $800 million on Brazil’s São Paolo-based B3 stock exchange in 2007, which was at the time the most successful debut in the history of its stock market.

What are the factors driving the momentum? The rebound in Indian equities, which includes some opportunistic buying, has been driven by strong investor confidence in India’s economic fundamentals, long-term growth story, and relative insulation from global tariff disruptions. That said, markets have yet to fully work out the potential second-order effects of trade disruptions. These, combined with broader macro uncertainties, could still generate volatility. On valuations, while large-cap stocks are trading near historical averages, mid- and small-cap segments remain elevated at approximately 15 per cent and 30 per cent above their respective long-term averages. What types of products are high net-worth investors gravitating to? High-net-worth investors are becoming more sophisticated and seeking better diversification, higher yields, tax efficiency, and exposure to new asset classes. As a result, interest in equities has remained steady, debt allocations are more selective, and alternative investments are seeing a massive surge. Within alternatives, HNIs are increasingly allocating to private markets through PE and VC funds and, sometimes, through direct private deals. On the debt side, high-yield private credit is popular for its attractive 13-15 per cent yields, while venture debt offers similar returns with added upside from equity warrants. We also see interest in commercial real estate and infrastructure through AIFs and REITs/INVITs. What are your views on gold as an asset class? In Sanctum’s view, gold is an essential component of any asset allocation strategy, given its low correlation with other assets, role as an inflation hedge, and historical performance during geopolitical or macroeconomic stress. These reasons, combined with strong central bank demand and a shift in allocations away from US Treasuries more recently, have helped gold appreciate about 55% over the past couple of years. While a near-term correction is probable after such a strong rally, any pullback would be a good opportunity for under-allocated portfolios or longer-term investors to build exposure. How are clients viewing overseas investing at this juncture? As HNI families become increasingly global, often with children studying or residing abroad, interest in international investing has grown steadily. Traditionally, Indian investors have favoured overseas equities over debt, with the latter mainly used for liquidity management. Real estate overseas continues to appeal, particularly for personal use, but limited leverage options under LRS have been a constraint. Given current global uncertainty and volatility in US bond yields, many investors are adopting a cautious, wait-and-watch stance. How has the wealth management industry grown in recent years? What’s the outlook? India’s wealth management industry has grown at an impressive 15–20% annually in recent years, driven by massive wealth creation, buoyant markets, financialization of savings, expanding product offerings, and supportive regulation. Established firms have scaled significantly, and a spate of new entrants has emerged. The outlook remains strong. Entry barriers remain relatively low, so we may see more players enter. However, building a scaled and profitable franchise can take a long time. With rising competition and margin pressures, some consolidation is likely. What are the trends and challenges impacting Sanctum Wealth and the industry at large? Several structural forces are driving growth. Economic expansion and asset price appreciation are fueling wealth creation. Regulatory evolution has helped widen the product universe, especially in alternatives. There’s a growing democratization of access to sophisticated strategies. And while still early, technology, particularly AI, offers transformative potential. Competitive intensity is rising, and margins are under pressure. There is a shortage of skilled talent, made worse by limited investment in training and development. This leads to high churn and cost inflation. Meanwhile, the slow adoption of digital solutions is holding back productivity gains. That said, technology remains a significant opportunity if deployed strategically and with scale. How have costs and the regulatory landscape changed, and how has it impacted margins? On balance, regulation has been a long-term positive, creating a stronger, more transparent framework that has improved trust and enabled product innovation. However, short-term pressures are real. Fee caps, incentive guidelines, advice segregation rules, and tighter oversight of manager compensation have compressed margins. At the same time, talent scarcity has pushed compensation costs higher. Firms that succeed in combining operational efficiency with robust compliance and governance will be best positioned to thrive in this evolving landscape.

May 13, 2025 17:07 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, May 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Microsoft Layoffs Impact 7,000 Workers As Company Adjusts For AI
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriswestfall/2025/05/13/microsoft-layoffs-impact-7000-workers-as-company-adjusts-for-ai/

ByChris Westfall ByChris Westfall, Contributor. Layoffs driven by AI investment will effect more than 6,000 employees. In a move signaling a significant strategic pivot, Microsoft today announced a reduction of its workforce by more than 6,000 employees, representing about 3% of its total headcount. While such news often triggers concerns about automation and job displacement due to artificial intelligence, the company indicated a different rationale: This adjustment is a calculated step to optimize resources and ensure continued robust investment in Microsoft’s burgeoning AI platform. The decision to streamline certain operations (and create bottom-line impact) is designed to free up capital to drive the company’s AI-centric strategy. “We have made huge investments in AI because we are optimistic about what it can do to help people, industry and society, and because we’re committed to bringing technology and people together to realize the promises of AI responsibly," the company has previously shared on its website. Reuters reports that it is this investment in new AI initiatives, not the AI technology itself, that has caused the company to reduce its staff. However, CEO Satya Nadella told a Silicon Valley audience that “maybe 20, 30% of the code that is inside of our repos today, and some of our projects, are probably all written by software.” In that same conversation, on stage with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Nadella described his vision for Microsoft as a ”distillation factory", where they would take large, general purpose AI models and shrink them down into smaller, specialized and even task-specific models. Nadella has often spoken of the “democratization of AI” and his plans for the technology. Indeed, efforts are underway to target businesses with AI-powered tools and platforms, as the company embeds AI capabilities into mainstay products like Microsoft 365, Azure, and Dynamics365. And Wall Street has responded in a positive way. Microsoft’s gross profit margins have consistently been in the high 60’s-low 70% range over the last few years, making the stock a favorite for institutional investors. On Monday, Microsoft shares ended trading at $449.26, the highest price so far this year. (They closed at a record $467.56 last July). The company recently reported quarterly revenues of $70.07 billion, beating Wall Street expectations. For comparison, Nadella has said the company will spend $80 billion in fiscal year 2025 on AI-related efforts. Analyst Gil Luria says that headcount reduction is a natural result of those kinds of capital investment numbers, hinting that more layoffs might be ahead. “We believe that every year Microsoft invests at the current levels, it would need to reduce headcount by at least 10,000 in order to make up for the higher depreciation levels due to their capital expenditures,” Luria said, according to Reuters. The displaced workforce includes about 1,985 workers in Washington state, where the company is headquartered. Overall, there are 228,000 workers at the company. The layoff news for these laid off workers can’t be easy, as the trend in tech layoffs continues. Corrected, May 14: An earlier version of this article misstated the number of Microsoft employees likely to be cut; it’s more than 6,000, or less than 3% of the company’s workforce.

Title: Stocks just erased all of this year’s losses as investors welcome trade progress

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: The S&P 500 benchmark stock index hit another milestone in its remarkable march higher from the brink of a bear market in recent weeks: It has now erased all its losses for this year. US stocks were mixed Tuesday as investors digested cooling inflation data and easing trade tensions between the United States and China. The Dow closed lower by 270 points, or 0.64%. Meanwhile, the broader S&P 500 rose 0.72% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 1.61%. For the year, the Dow is still down 0.95% and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.56% this year. Wall Street got a major boost on Monday after Washington and Beijing brokered an agreement to substantially lower tariffs for 90 days. Stocks rose further on Tuesday as new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed a surprising cooldown in annual inflation ahead of the impact of Trump’s tariffs. Consumer prices in April recorded their lowest annual increase since February 2021. Stocks have been on a tear for the past month after Trump began to change his tune on tariffs, announcing carve-outs for some tariffs on China and the prospect of inking some trade deals. “Fears of slowing growth and a recession caused by punitive tariffs drove markets lower in the first week of April, but they’ve rebounded on the heels of a tariff pause and a Chinese trade breakthrough, and now a better-than-expected inflation report removes the last big overhang for the market,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management, in a Tuesday note. Nvidia (NVDA) surged 5.63% Tuesday after the chip giant announced it would partner with Saudi Arabia on artificial intelligence initiatives. The Dow was the only index that fell on Tuesday. It was largely weighed down by UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which sank 17.8% after the company suspended its earnings guidance and CEO Andrew Witty said he would step down for personal reasons. The Dow is weighted by share prices, and UnitedHealth has a significant influence on the index’s performance. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Waldencast Reports Q1 2025 Financial Results

May 13, 2025 16:15 ET | Source: Waldencast plc. Waldencast plc. Q1 Net Revenue of $65.4 million, (4.1)% decline from Q1 202476.4% Adjusted Gross Margin, an improvement of 10 basis points$4.4 million of Adjusted EBITDA LONDON, May 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Waldencast plc (NASDAQ: WALD) (“Waldencast” or the “Company”), a global multi-brand beauty and wellness platform, today reported operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2025 (“Q1 2025”) on Form 6-K to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which are also available on our investor relations site at http://ir.waldencast.com/. Michel Brousset, Waldencast Founder and CEO, said: “As anticipated, in Q1 2025, Milk Makeup results were impacted by the cycling of the very successful launch of Jellies in Q1 2024, as well as the significant inventory reduction at the retail level versus a year ago.” “Despite a broader slowdown in the prestige beauty category in the U.S., Milk Makeup ended the quarter on a very strong note, fueled by the highly successful launch of Hydro Grip Gel Tint, which sold out shortly after release. We are also very pleased with the brand’s entry into Ulta Beauty, with retail sales beginning in late February. Both initiatives exceeded expectations and contributed to the brand’s high single-digit growth in U.S. retail sales. This solid domestic performance was offset by the contraction of international sales, which faced a difficult comparison against last year’s Q1 distribution expansion, as well as inventory reduction by retail partners. In Q1, Milk Makeup partnered with Nike Running in North America for the Nike After Dark Tour in Los Angeles, bringing sport and self-expression together to keep expanding reach and deepen community engagement.” “The Obagi Medical brand delivered a solid performance in the first quarter, although out of stocks in some key SKUs dampened volume growth. We are accelerating ongoing efforts to transform our supply chain—consolidating third party logistics partners and enhancing operational capabilities—to improve fulfillment, increase reliability, and support long-term, scalable growth.” “Despite a difficult quarter, we continue to increase our investments in marketing, up in the high teens, to fuel brand equity and set a strong foundation for delivering our long-term ambitions, starting with our 2025 objectives.” “We are confident in our ability to deliver a stronger performance throughout the remainder of the year, beginning in Q2. Key drivers include a robust pipeline of breakthrough innovation at both Milk Makeup and Obagi Medical, combined with restocking of Hydro Grip Gel Tint which is expected to fuel continued consumer demand. We also anticipate a meaningful uplift in Milk Makeup volumes from the successful Ulta Beauty launch. Additionally, ongoing improvements from Obagi Medical’s supply chain restructuring are expected to enhance fulfillment rates and operational resilience,” concluded Mr. Brousset. Q1 2025 Results Overview Please refer to the definitions and reconciliations set out further in this release with respect to certain adjusted non-GAAP measures discussed below which are included to provide an easier understanding of the underlying performance of the business, but should not be seen as a substitute for the U.S. GAAP numbers presented in this release. For the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024: Net Revenue decreased 4.1% year-over-year to $65.4 million. Gross Profit was $47.2 million, while Adjusted Gross Profit totaled $50.0 million, or 76.4% of net revenue, an expansion of 10 basis points compared to the prior year. Net Loss for Q1 2025 was $20.7 million primarily driven by Depreciation and Financial charges. Non-recurring legal and advisory expenses totaled $1.5 million, continuing their decline from prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.4 million, or 6.7% of net revenue. The year-over-year decline reflects sustained investments in sales and marketing, and G&A deleverage stemming from lower revenue. Liquidity: As previously announced, during Q1, Waldencast secured a new $205 million five-year credit facility, comprising a $175 million term loan and a $30 million revolving credit facility (“RCF”). This refinancing replaces the previous bank loans, enhances financial flexibility, and extends the Company’s debt maturity profile to March 2030, supporting long-term strategic priorities. As of March 31, 2025, the Company held $10.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, $172.1 million in net debt, and approximately $22.5 million in available capacity under the RCF. The increase in net debt during the quarter is primarily due to refinancing-related costs. Cash consumption reflects lower Adjusted EBITDA and an inventory build-up to support expected sales growth in future quarters. Outstanding Shares: As of April 30, 2025, we had 123,011,239 ordinary shares outstanding, consisting of 112,644,711 Class A shares and 10,366,528 Class B shares. As of December 31, 2024, we had 122,692,968 ordinary shares outstanding, consisting of 112,026,440 Class A shares and 10,666,528 Class B shares. First Quarter 2025 Brand Highlights: Obagi Medical: Milk Makeup: Fiscal 2025 Outlook: While mindful of the broader macroeconomic environment and assuming no further material changes to current tariffs, including the latest updates on China, we remain confident that our strategic initiatives position us well to deliver on our full-year guidance of mid-teens net revenue growth and an adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid-to-high teens. Given our high gross margin business model and limited reliance on Asian sourcing, we expect a limited increase in cost of goods with any necessary price adjustments (likely in the low-to-mid single digits) to offset the announced tariff scenario. Conference Call and Webcast Information Waldencast will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter results on Wednesday, May 14, 2025, at 8:30 AM EDT for the period ended March 31, 2025. Those interested in participating in the conference call are invited to dial (877) 704-4453. International callers may dial (201) 389-0920. A live webcast of the conference call will include a slide presentation and will be available online at https://ir.waldencast.com/. A replay of the webcast will remain available on the website until our next conference call. The information accessible on, or through, our website is not incorporated by reference into this release. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to the financial measures presented in this release in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Waldencast separately reports financial results on the basis of the measures set out and defined below which are non-GAAP financial measures. Waldencast believes the non-GAAP measures used in this release provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. Waldencast believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends. These non-GAAP measures also provide perspective on how Waldencast’s management evaluates and monitors the performance of the business. There are limitations to non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in GAAP financial presentation. The items excluded from GAAP financial measures such as net income/loss to arrive at non-GAAP financial measures are significant components for understanding and assessing our financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not alternatives to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to definitions set out in the release and the tables included in this release for a reconciliation of these metrics to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Gross Profit is defined as GAAP gross profit excluding the impact of amortization of the supply agreement and formulation intangible assets, and the amortization of the fair value of the related party liability from the Obagi Medical China Business, which was not acquired by Waldencast at the time of the business combination with Obagi Medical and Milk Makeup (the “Business Combination”). The Adjusted Gross Profit reconciliation by Segment for each period is included in the Appendix. Adjusted Gross Margin is defined as Adjusted Gross Profit divided by GAAP Net Revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as GAAP net income (loss) before interest income or expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization, and further adjusted for the items as described in the reconciliation below. We believe this information will be useful for investors to facilitate comparisons of our operating performance and better identify trends in our business. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain expenses that are required to be presented in accordance with GAAP because management believes they are non-core to our regular business. These include non-cash expenses, such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, the amortization and release of fair value of the related party liability to the Obagi Medical China Business, change in fair value of assets and liabilities, and foreign currency translation loss (gain). In addition, adjustments include expenses that are not related to our underlying business performance including (1) legal, advisory and consultant fees related to the financial restatement of previously issued financial statements and associated regulatory investigation, and (2) other non-recurring costs, primarily legal settlement costs and restructuring costs. The Adjusted EBITDA by Segment for each period is included in the Appendix. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue. The Adjusted EBITDA Margin reconciliation by Segment for each period is included in the Appendix. Net Debt Position is defined as the principal outstanding for the 2022 term loan and 2022 revolving credit facility minus the cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2025.

May 13, 2025 15:16 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, May 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. The class action concerns whether Elevance and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. You have until July 11, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance securities during the Class Period. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On July 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the second quarter of 2024. During the call, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Gail Boudreaux revealed that “[a]s a result of redeterminations, our Medicaid membership mix has shifted, resulting in increased acuity,” and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) Mark Kaye stated that Elevance was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” Kaye elaborated that the Company was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the third quarter of 2024. During the call, CEO Boudreaux revealed that the Company’s “third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $8.37, which was below our expectations, primarily due to elevated medical costs in our Medicaid business.” Boudreaux further revealed that Elevance had reduced its full-year outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) from $37.20 to “approximately $33”—despite the fact that the Company had reiterated its EPS guidance just three months earlier. When questioned about the sudden change in Medicaid cost trends, CFO Kaye explained that “we experienced accelerated cost trends in Medicaid throughout the third quarter” and “saw unfavorable prior-period development related to the current year, specifically in our Medicaid business.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024. Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 85 years later, Pomerantz continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomlaw.com. Attorney advertising. Prior results do not guarantee similar outcomes.

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant keeps getting better. From setting timers to controlling your smart home, these are the best commands to make the most of your Echo devices. You can use all of these Alexa commands if you have the fifth-generation Echo Dot with Clock. Amazon's voice assistant Alexa has evolved far beyond the simple talking speaker that launched more than a decade ago. Like Siri on your iPhone, playing music or checking weather updates is fine, but Alexa is capable of so much more -- and it's getting smarter all the time. Today's Alexa can handle sophisticated voice commands without tripping itself up, control your Fire TV devices, manage daily routines and transform your home into a fully automated smart environment from the future. As we move through spring cleaning season, these new and improved capabilities can be invaluable in helping you organize your home and schedule, especially with Amazon's new, smarter Alexa Plus with AI-powered features now available. Recent research reveals many users have concerns about these increasingly capable assistants -- a recent CNET survey found 73% of US adults using home voice assistants have privacy concerns about AI integrations, though Amazon's Alexa remains the most trusted voice assistant among respondents. Want to unlock Alexa's full potential? You just need to learn the right commands. If you have an Echo device at home, here's a complete guide to all the voice commands worth trying. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $19.99 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed back in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa+ aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Prior to that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs.

We read every piece of feedback, and take your input very seriously. To see all available qualifiers, see our documentation. An Unofficial UniFi Network & Protect API Client & CLI, written in Golang An Unofficial UniFi Network & Protect API Client & CLI command, written in Golang. Install unified from go: Set your UniFi API key Try it out: If all goes well, you should see something like: Note that the output is valid JSON, just like the UniFi applications produce. --debug is a helpful flag if you'd like to see more information about unified's operation. Log output is printed to stderr by default. This way logging doesn't interfere with parsing of unified's regular stdout output. unified has a full help system accessible through the --help flag. To access the Network API you will use: and for the Protect API use: unified can be configured via a yaml file: Which can be located at any of the following: Or you can manually specify which config file to use with the --config flag. Learn how to generate an API key from UniFi's official documentation. Network and Protect are "Local Applications". Warning Your API key is a sensitive secret! Please keep it securely stored. It gives FULL API access to your UniFi applications. If you need to revoke an API key navigate to your UniFi application and then to your Admin user: Settings -> Admins & User -> Select Admin account associated with the API key -> Click on API Key -> Remove. You can always generate a new API key if necessary. Now, you can pass your API key to unified in one of two ways: To instantiate a client you should call client.NewClient: Access to actual API client calls is mediated through NetworkV1 and ProtectV1 interfaces. Like so: These interfaces strive to closely mirror the actual APIs exposed by the Network and Protect applications. Protect's API has a couple of interesting endpoints which allow a client to subscribe to a Websocket event stream. The ProtectV1 interface exposes a pair of methods which provide easy access to those streams as golang channels: and while it's certainly do-able to consume those event channels, unified also provides a handler for each event type that makes consuming and re-acting to these events even easier. Here's a brief example of using ProtectEventStreamHandler: A nearly-identical struct exists to handle ProtectDeviceEvents: ProtectDeviceEventStreamHandler. doorbell.go is a full example of using a stream handler. Example programs can be built via: Full Protect API support is planned in short order. After the initial versioned release of this project, work will proceed towards full Protect V1 API support. As well as a full v1.0.0 release. Reference documentation through godoc is also a priority before a v1.0.0 release. Access API might be supported in a future release. Contributions welcome here. Unifi's provided TLS certificates are self-signed and do not sign for the unifi hostname. They do sign for unifi.local, but the default DNS configuration for my UDM Pro does not seem to add an entry for unifi.local. Therefore TLS verification generally fails when https protocol connections are attemped. unified defaults to TLS verification being off. In short, at least two general issues need to be solved to enable TLS verification by default: I'd like to find an easy way to solve these two issues and re-enable TLS verification by default before a full v1.0.0 release. UniFi Network API V1 is fully supported as of Network application version "9.1.120". UniFi Protect API is only partially supported, with the following endpoints supported: UniFi Access API is not yet supported. Contributions are welcome! Before submiting any PRs, please ensure your commits build and lint. Also, take care to test any changes, and ideally submit unit tests or integration tests which cover your changes. PRs must pass all CI in order to be considered acceptable to merge. If you'd like to contribute a feature or API support that doesn't yet exist, please communicate your intention through a new or existing GitHub issue. Let's try to avoid duplicating work, and make sure the work aligns with project goals. If you find a bug, please report it via GitHub issues. The more descriptive you can be, the better. Please include specific steps to reproduce. Bonus points for submitting a PR to fix it! Unified is built primarily via mage. All command examples assume current working directory is the repository root. To build the unified CLI command you would run: Which will build unified as well as any of its dependencies. If successful, it should place the binary at build/unified. Will run any unit tests available. Which are not many at this point. Any reasonable unit test contributions are welcome. If you have a UniFi API host available, you can run integration tests: This will run an integration test that uses ./build/unified to send requests to https://unifi and verify results. Warning While designed to be non-destructive to existing application objects and configuration, some non-GET endpoints are called. Please take a look at existing integration tests and verify you're comfortable running them against your API host. We are not responsible for any harm they might cause to your network device/control-plane. There are facilities to backup your configuration and we strongly suggest you do so before running these tests. Thanks for checking this project out. Hope it helps you in some way. If it does, consider buying me a coffee or otherwise contributing back to the project in some way. Thanks again!

May 13, 2025 12:24 ET | Source: Gainey McKenna & Egleston Gainey McKenna & Egleston NEW YORK, May 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gainey McKenna & Egleston announces that a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) securities between April 18, 2024 and October 16, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). The lawsuit seeks to recover damages for the Company’s investors under the federal securities laws. According to the Complaint, throughout the Class Period, with the Medicaid redetermination process nearly complete, Defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. The Complaint alleges that while Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The Complaint further alleges that Defendants maintained they had “visibility into 75% of our Medicaid rates and premiums for 2024” and that “[t]he vast majority of those are in line with our expectations and they’re actuarially sound.” The Complaint also alleges that Defendants further reassured investors that “we’re intentionally remaining thoughtful and prudent in our outlook,” and that, while the Company was seeing an acuity mix shift in the Medicaid business, it was “nothing outside of the bounds of what we’ve expected and guided for.” The Complaint alleges that these representations were materially false or misleading. The Complaint alleges that in truth, the redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. The Complaint further alleges that this shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. According to the Complaint, the truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” The Complaint alleges that in response to these disclosures, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, from a closing price of $553.14 on July 16, 2024, to a closing price of $520.93 on July 17, 2024. Investors who purchased or otherwise acquired shares of Elevance should contact the Firm prior to the July 11, 2025 lead plaintiff motion deadline. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Microsoft on Tuesday said that it’s laying off 3% of employees across all levels, teams and geographies. “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC. The company reported better-than-expected results, with $25.8 billion in quarterly net income, and an upbeat forecast in late April. Microsoft had 228,000 employees worldwide at the end of June, meaning that the move will affect thousands of employees. It’s likely Microsoft’s largest round of layoffs since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023. In January the company announced a small round of layoffs that were performance-based. These new job cuts are not related to performance, the spokesperson said. One objective is to reduce layers of management, the spokesperson said. In January Amazon announced that it was getting rid of some employees after noticing “unnecessary layers” in its organization. Last week cybersecurity software provider CrowdStrike announced it would lay off 5% of its workforce. In January, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts that the company would make sales execution changes that led to lower growth than expected in Azure cloud revenue that wasn’t tied to artificial intelligence. Performance in AI cloud growth outdid internal projections. “How do you really tweak the incentives, go-to-market?” Nadella said. “At a time of platform shifts, you kind of want to make sure you lean into even the new design wins, and you just don’t keep doing the stuff that you did in the previous generation.” On Monday, Microsoft shares stopped trading at $449.26, the highest price so far this year. They closed at a record $467.56 last July. Jordan Novet is a CNBC technology reporter specializing in artificial intelligence, cloud computing and Microsoft. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Dadu Shin Hannah Levintova, with data analysis by Melissa LewisMay 13, 2025 Sungida Rashid had no intention of taking an Uber to the birth of her first child. She’d never been one to take the easy route, and besides, she wanted to get things moving—and walking seemed the best way to do it. So on an overcast Sunday in October 2023, Sungida and her husband, Nabil Haque, set out from their Boston apartment to St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center, the local hospital where ­Sungida, nine months pregnant, was scheduled to be induced. Sungida and Nabil had met 12 years earlier while working at a consulting firm in their native Bangladesh. Over lunches, they began strategizing about PhD applications, eventually spending years in a long-distance relationship as they fell in love and pursued their doctoral degrees in the United States. Then there was a tiny pandemic wedding, a move to Bangkok for work (she was an economics professor, he a climate researcher), a heartbreaking miscarriage, the cautious joy of another pregnancy, and finally, when Sungida was seven months along, a job opportunity for Nabil at Boston University. Sungida had waved off her husband’s suggestion that they delay his start date so she could stick with her doctors in ­Bangkok. She’d long dreamed of teaching at an American university, and the pandemic had upended several job prospects. Living in Boston would give her the chance to pursue a professorship again and, more importantly, to raise their little girl far from Bangladesh, in a country that offered greater opportunities, cleaner air, and better medical care. In their first days in Boston, Nabil set up appointments at two prospective hospitals: Brigham and Women’s, a world-­renowned nonprofit medical center, and St. Elizabeth’s, a humbler facility owned by a national for-profit hospital chain called Steward Health Care. The appointment at St. Elizabeth’s came first, and Sungida liked the midwife, so they canceled the other appointment. A few weeks later, they walked in and got ready for her induction. Her labor moved slowly, but at around 1 a.m. on October 17, Sungida gave birth to a healthy baby girl. She and Nabil named her Otindria—Bangladeshi for “extra sensory”—and snapped a smiling selfie as a new family of three, Otindria snuggled in a hospital swaddle. In the hours after, Sungida experienced some excess bleeding that doctors resolved, and soon she and Nabil moved to the recovery floor. With Otindria in her bassinet and Sungida in bed, Nabil coordinated video calls with family. He kept trying, and failing, to swaddle the baby in her ­blanket—he and Sungida laughed at how easy the nurses made it look. She reassured him they would get the hang of it. In the afternoon, Nabil made a quick trip back to their apartment. When he returned, he told Sungida he already missed his newborn daughter. “Oh, you don’t miss me now?” she joked. She was having some back pain, and nurses brought in ice packs and heating pads for relief. But as the couple settled in to watch The ­Avengers—Sungida was a huge Marvel fan—her pain worsened. After about 10 minutes, staff came in to check her vitals. Her blood pressure had dropped dangerously low. Alarms began to sound: “Code red on the recovery floor!” a voice blared over the loudspeaker. What felt to Nabil like 20 people rushed into their room. They wheeled Sungida out and took Otindria to the nursery. Nabil sat in the recovery room alone—no bed, no baby. Every so often, someone came by with an update. A CT scan showed Sungida’s abdomen had filled with blood; she needed surgery. In the OR, doctors discovered the bleed was coming from her liver. They told Nabil they would insert an embolism coil—a small device that can be placed in blood vessels to stem internal bleeding. About half an hour later, hospital staff informed Nabil they needed to transfer his wife to Boston Medical Center, 20 minutes away, because it was better equipped to do the procedure, they said. What no one told him was that St. Elizabeth’s supply of embolism coils had been repossessed by the vendor a month earlier. According to a complaint later filed with the state health department, the hospital owed more than $500,000 for these devices; the vendor claimed in a lawsuit that, nationally, Steward facilities owed it nearly $5 million. A group of St. Elizabeth’s nurses had confronted Steward management about this at a tense union meeting three weeks prior: What if a patient needed a coil? The irritated chief nursing officer responded that the hospital simply wouldn’t accept transfer patients with internal bleeding. But what if something happened in-house? The CNO didn’t answer the question. Now that exact scenario was unfolding, and staff had little choice but to transfer a woman in the midst of surgery. A nurse whisked Nabil upstairs to watch as Sungida, lying on a stretcher, her face pale, tubes up her nose, was wheeled down a hallway and out to a waiting ambulance. It would be the last time he saw her alive. St. Elizabeth’s was just a sliver of Steward’s empire. At its peak, the company boasted 41 hospitals in 10 states, medical facilities in four foreign countries, and roughly $8 billion in annual revenue. It distinguished itself to investors by promising a way to tackle a thorny problem for the industry: how to run hospitals in low-income communities while still turning a profit. Industry dominance was always the dream of Steward’s CEO, Ralph de la Torre. When he took the helm of a struggling Massachusetts-based Catholic hospital chain called Caritas Christi in 2008, de la Torre—a child of Cuban immigrants and famously ambitious cardiac surgeon—was so sure of succeeding that he let his medical license expire. Two years later, he convinced the powerful private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management to buy ­Caritas, which it renamed Steward. His timing was perfect: Private equity firms, which focus on generating a big, quick payday for their investors, had just begun ramping up their positions in health care. De la Torre hoped that teaming up with Wall Street would catapult him to national prominence, kicking off what the Boston Globe called “a royal conquest.” His reign came to an end when Steward filed for bankruptcy in May 2024, a spectacular downfall helped along by Cerberus and Medical Properties Trust (MPT), a mysterious Alabama-based real estate investment trust that became heavily involved in the company over the last decade. Steward has since been the subject of news reports and Senate hearings trying to grasp the astonishing scale of its unpaid bills—$9 billion owed to more than 100,000 creditors—and the extent to which patients suffered as executives enriched themselves. De la Torre, for instance, bought himself a $40 million yacht and an $8 million apartment in Madrid, made hundreds of trips on Steward’s private plane, and gave $10 million to his children’s elite prep school in Dallas, a donation financed partially from Steward’s coffers, according to leaked documents obtained by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project. Cerberus made $800 million, more than tripling its investment. The CEO of MPT earned nearly $18 million last year, making him the highest-paid executive in Alabama. (De la Torre did not respond to a request for comment. Cerberus and MPT declined to answer questions from Mother Jones. In public documents, both companies have denied that their actions contributed to Steward’s financial distress.) It was Sungida’s death that first connected this excess to its human costs. A January 2024 Globe story lit a fire under Massachusetts officials and regulators, who expressed outrage that profit motive had trumped patient care in a city that prides itself on world-class hospitals. Sen. Ed Markey convened a hearing that opened with a reference to Sungida, while Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who for years has fought to rein in Wall Street, warned that Steward was no outlier. “I will say it bluntly,” she said. “Turning private equity loose in our health care system kills people.” I’ve heard this repeatedly while writing about private equity over the last five years. One study found that private equity–owned nursing homes had a mortality rate 10 percent higher than their non-PE counterparts; another noted that patients at PE-owned hospitals are 25 percent more likely to suffer an unrelated injury while admitted, whether a fall or an infection. But such studies only provide a glimpse of the problem. As savvy executives squeeze returns out of facilities that determine whether patients live or die, there is no systematic data tracking how their acquisitions affect care. Before its downfall, Steward was among private equity’s biggest health care conquests. I wanted to know how many more Sungidas were out there. “The reason that there are more cases with Steward is not because they have worse doctors. It’s that they didn’t give the doctors and nurses and all the staff the resources they need to do their job the right way.” Over the course of our yearlong investigation, Mother Jones reviewed every malpractice, personal injury, and wrongful death case filed in state and federal courts involving Steward hospitals. We found 469 lawsuits involving 83 patient deaths; many have settled or have been thwarted by Steward’s bankruptcy, while some were dismissed or resolved in the company’s favor. These numbers may understate the extent of the problem, given that the company’s hospitals served primarily low-income communities, where most patients and their families lack the resources to mount a case. We also combed through Steward’s federal inspection reports, finding 708 “deficiencies” in patient care, including 35 classified as “immediate jeopardy”—situations that led or could lead to serious harm or injury. Although it is difficult to pinpoint the degree to which Steward’s business choices contributed to poor treatment, academic research has shown that systemic issues, not individual errors, typically lie at the root of malpractice. Steward’s bankruptcy paused many of the malpractice suits, making it difficult or impossible for attorneys to depose medical staff or obtain company records—information that could link their allegations of malpractice to cost-cutting decisions. But what is clear, experts say, is that a pattern of substandard care arose as Steward and its partners prioritized their bottom lines. (Steward declined to answer detailed questions from Mother Jones.) “Steward made a decision somewhere along the line that in order to keep making the money they wanted to make, there were going to have to be cuts,” says Rob Higgins, a partner at the Boston malpractice firm Lubin & Meyer who has litigated dozens of cases against Steward hospitals. “The reason that there are more cases with Steward is not because they have worse doctors. It’s that they didn’t give the doctors and nurses and all the staff the resources they need to do their job the right way.” Our reporting builds on the work of other journalists and legislators who have investigated Steward’s activities. The Globe’s Spotlight team found at least 15 patients who died at Steward facilities after receiving subpar care. A Senate report from September found that heart-failure death rates at some hospitals increased by up to 40 percent on Steward’s watch, even as the national average declined. Wait times in Steward ERs were also far above the national average. Our investigation also dug up allegations of sexual assault by medical staff, lawsuits by whistleblowers who alleged they were fired for calling out Steward management, and a troubling pattern of problems in labor and delivery: We found 12 additional instances of moms and newborns who died at Steward hospitals over the last 14 years, and 21 more who suffered severe injuries. From skipped ultrasounds to inexplicable delays in emergency care, the court filings recount gutting details. One Florida woman lost her baby after waiting almost three hours for someone to perform a C-section, despite a placental abruption, excessive bleeding, and dramatic drops in the fetal heart rate; it was her ninth pregnancy and the first she’d carried to term after years of IVF. At another Steward hospital in Florida, doctors wanted to prescribe a steroid drug to treat a woman’s postpartum blood disorder, but no administrators were reachable over Labor Day weekend to approve the order, and she died. At St. Elizabeth’s, where Sungida went, another patient bled so much after giving birth that she suffered a stroke and needed brain surgery—in part because an ultrasound to assess the hemorrhage was done too late. At a Steward facility in Texas, a baby was born with severe brain injuries after staff waited almost a day to perform a C-section, despite clear signs of fetal distress. There are more cases like these: 49 of Steward’s federal deficiency reports involve maternal care. The labor and delivery problems at ­Steward hospitals are consistent with an industry cost-cutting trend: When private equity firms and other financiers buy hospitals, they tend to target obstetrics units. “There is a mismatch between how much obstetrics costs and how much revenue it generates,” explains Katy Kozhimannil, a health policy professor at the University of Minnesota who studies maternal unit closures. Insurance reimbursement rates for maternal services are notoriously low, and the costs of running a fully staffed unit—with specialized doctors, nurses, anesthesiologists, and birthing equipment—can quickly outpace returns. As the allegations of deadly neglect swirl around Steward, its investors, executives, and partners have faced little accountability. Many hospitals eat the loss, Kozhimannil says, because maternity services fulfill a community need and align with their public mission. But investor-owned hospitals, unwilling to make that trade-off, have been closing maternity wards for years. Ascension, a Catholic hospital chain that partnered with the private equity firm TowerBrook Capital Partners, has closed more than a quarter of the labor and delivery units at its 140-plus hospitals over the last decade. Prospect Medical Holdings shuttered one of the few obstetrics units in its 16-hospital system after it was taken over by the private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners. Steward closed at least six labor units and two neonatal units, as well as three hospitals that provided obstetric services—eliminating a third of the labor units in its portfolio. As the allegations of deadly neglect swirl around Steward, its investors, executives, and partners have faced little accountability. Senators held de la Torre in criminal contempt after he refused to testify at a hearing in September, yet officials from Cerberus and MPT, the real estate investment trust, weren’t even summoned, despite their involvement in Steward’s unraveling. A number of financial analysts have published evidence showing how MPT, which still owns the real estate of dozens of Steward hospitals, used those properties in its own enrichment scheme. MPT has gone to extremes to quash the findings, paying millions of dollars to private intelligence firms to target Steward’s critics, filing a defamation lawsuit, and subpoenaing those who dare speak to the press. The broader Steward saga is stunning in its complexity, brazenness, and scale, laying bare the extent to which profit-­seeking and patient care are incompatible, and the lengths to which corporate titans have gone to hide that reality. “All of a sudden, somewhere, there’s a switch that turns that says, maybe we can make a boatload of money,” Higgins says. “They were living a lifestyle of NBA basketball players that have hundreds of millions of dollars. And it’s scary to think that for a long period of time, they were running these hospitals the way they were.” Nabil got to Boston Medical around midnight. He was ushered into an empty waiting room and told to make himself comfortable: His wife’s surgery would be long. He called his parents and made plans for them to fly to Boston to help during what surely would be a difficult recovery. Barely an hour later, a surgeon appeared. They had tried everything, but the bleeding was too severe. There was just too much damage to her liver. Sungida was dead. “How?” Nabil asked in disbelief. “We don’t know,” the doctor said. He told Nabil he could request an autopsy. “I will say it bluntly. Turning private equity loose in our health care system kills people.” Nabil sat in the waiting room, stunned. Just hours ago, he and Sungida had been talking about watching a movie together. Now he was texting relatives with the unspeakable news. He was eventually led through a maze of hallways and into a basement room where a staffer pulled back a curtain and revealed his wife’s body, covered with a sheet. “It was so scary seeing her lifeless,” he says. “I couldn’t stand there for more than five minutes.” Someone called him an Uber. When he got back to his apartment at 4 a.m., Nabil saw Sungida everywhere: in her beloved saris and half-used perfume bottles and the suitcase of pre-pregnancy clothes she hadn’t yet unpacked because none of them fit. He opened the fridge to find the food she’d prepared for their first days as a family of three. “I was still in shock,” he recalls. “I didn’t know what to do.” His mind turned to his daughter, and to their unfathomable future: “She was so tiny and so fragile—how is she going to survive this?” When Nabil called the nursery to check on Otindria, the nurses said she was doing fine. They asked after Sungida—they hadn’t yet heard. After the call ended, the nurses texted him photos of the baby. He couldn’t believe how much she already looked like her mother. For the rest of his life, he realized, it would be his job to convince ­Otindria that what happened wasn’t her fault. He climbed into the shower and, for the first time, allowed himself to cry. Later, he sat down and wrote a Facebook post: “Yesterday, I welcomed my daughter to this world,” it began. “Today, I am in grief losing the mother of my daughter due to unexplained medical circumstances.” He asked their friends to reminisce about Sungida and to refrain from asking medical questions. Her doctors were “bewildered,” he wrote. After a few hours of sleep, he headed back to St. Elizabeth’s to check on Otindria and attend a briefing with hospital staff. It was held just a few doors down from the recovery room where Sungida had so recently been alive, alert, and cracking jokes. Doctors and administrators crowded into the cramped room. As Nabil held his newborn, they told him that this was a freak event. They hypothesized that the hormonal roller coaster of labor and birth had caused a blood vessel in Sungida’s liver to burst. Maybe, they said, something about her liver was anatomically different. There was no mention of the repossessed coils, of the tense union meeting, or of the management’s failure to plan for this very scenario. Nabil remembers them saying repeatedly that his wife’s death was improbable and random: “They said, ‘You can think of it like your wife got hit by lightning.’” He had only one question, the one gnawing at him since the night before. Would Otindria blame herself? One of the doctors answered immediately: If she ever does, he should tell her it was the hospital’s fault. Steward’s rise and fall is a telling example of how the private equity playbook has infiltrated American life. Over the last two decades, PE firms, which invest money on behalf of wealthy clients and major investors like pension funds, have been buying up everything from family homes and apartment buildings to day cares and medical practices and transforming them into bundles of assets to be engineered for profit. They charge investors hefty management fees and, in exchange, promise market-beating returns in just a few years. To do that, they focus on cutting costs—scrimping on wages, benefits, and materials—to extract maximal returns. When President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, he unwittingly opened up a fresh prospect for private equity. The droves of newly insured Americans, the industry suspected, would mean a big revenue boost for hospitals. Community hospitals presented a particularly attractive option because Medicaid expansion meant more patients at higher reimbursement rates, and the government would likely bail out facilities that failed. Soon private equity firms were snapping up hospitals like never before. That same year, Cerberus—named for the three-headed dog who guards Hades in Greek mythology—bought six hospitals from de la Torre’s small Catholic hospital chain, Caritas, for $895 million. It put up one-third of the total in cash, and, as is common in private equity deals, financed the rest with loans loaded onto Steward’s balance sheet. Turning a nonprofit into a for-profit required approval from Massachusetts’ attorney general, which she granted on condition that Cerberus invest $400 million in hospital upgrades. Cerberus complied, but covered the cost by saddling Steward with even more debt—loans that Cerberus and its investors would not be responsible for repaying. De la Torre, now Steward’s CEO, introduced himself soon after to the staff of one of the newly acquired hospitals. To a packed auditorium, he recalled learning to scuba dive as a kid and how he’d been taught you should always go with a partner. If you encounter a shark, he joked, you grab your diving knife, stab your partner, and swim away. “He was expecting a big laugh,” one staffer who attended the speech recalls. “But what he got was gasps.” Cerberus rapidly acquired five more ­Massachusetts hospitals, adding more debt to Steward’s ledger. By 2012, Steward was a $1.9 billion company with 17,000 employees, and it wasn’t long before executives’ cost-cutting efforts began drawing their ire. After the company eliminated more than 100 nursing jobs in two years, the nurses union filed more than 1,000 complaints with the state health department alleging unsafe staffing. Although Steward’s hospital portfolio was then limited to roughly a dozen facilities, it soon closed one of them and shut down pediatrics at another. It also began selling some of its buildings and renting them back. These “sale-leasebacks” ­provided a cash infusion to offset Steward’s growing debt load, which would triple during Cerberus’ first four years of ownership. In mid-2015, de la Torre flew to Alabama to meet with Edward Aldag, the unofficial king of health care sale-leasebacks. A dozen years earlier, Aldag had founded Medical Properties Trust, a one-of-a-kind real estate investment trust (REIT) that focused exclusively on doing such deals with hospitals. The men decided on the spot to work together: MPT’s annual report described them bonding over their “similar philosophies” about the future of health care. All involved had something to gain: ­Cerberus and de la Torre wanted to expand Steward, and an MPT deal would give them the cash to do it. MPT said in its annual report that it would collect rent from Steward hospitals and would have the option to buy any new facilities Steward acquired—to transform them, too, into lucrative tenants. “It’s just this long line of rinse and repeat of basically looting safety-net hospital systems.” By 2016, MPT had bought Steward’s nine remaining Massachusetts hospitals for $1.25 billion and leased them back at exorbitant rents. If the aim was to provide quality care, one of de la Torre’s colleagues told the Globe, this made no sense: “We all sort of nodded our heads and rolled our eyes and said, ‘Oh, now I get it. There are no plans to turn this into a viable set of community hospitals. It’s all about pulling money.’” Cerberus used proceeds from the sale to pay itself more than $700 million—a $473 million return on investment. De la Torre received a $71 million dividend. Over the next three years, Cerberus used the remaining funds to finance the purchase of 26 more hospitals in nine states, piling even more debt on Steward, whose facilities continued to face cuts. Patient care fiascoes were starting to escalate. At Good Samaritan Medical Center in 2018, a baby died when her mother’s uterus burst, according to legal filings—overworked staff had ignored her history of placental abruption. In fact, in the years after MPT first got involved, at least 20 patients died at Steward’s Massachusetts hospitals from alleged malpractice; 50 more died at its other facilities across the country during that time, according to the complaints we found. (Some of these cases were dismissed or settled; others remain open due to Steward’s bankruptcy.) In a region full of Harvard-affiliated doctors and hospitals known for being among the nation’s best, Steward’s raw Wall Street calculus was so foreign that it went virtually undetected, says Dr. Paul Hattis, a senior fellow at the Lown Institute, a health care think tank, who has served on the state’s Health Policy Commission. “I don’t think the regulatory apparatus was used to dealing with actors fueled by that kind of greed,” he says. “The money was going into the organization and then out the back door into the dividend pocket of an owner, but then neglecting patient care in the middle. That just was not something that we were used to thinking about having to protect against—the bleeding of an asset. So, you say, ‘Why didn’t regulators do more?’ I think they didn’t fully grasp what was going on until it was too late.” After Sungida’s death, Nabil’s parents, brother, and sister-in-law flew in to help. They shared his small bedroom while Nabil slept on the chaise in the living room, ­Otindria in her bassinet beside him. Every day delivered another gut punch. On Sungida’s phone, Nabil discovered a note she had written to introduce her baby to the world. He opened her inbox to find an interview offer for an economics professorship at Central Michigan University. “Seeing that email, I was like, You got everything you wanted,” he recalls. “It broke my heart.” About a month later, he got an email from a reporter at the Globe. Nurses at St. Elizabeth’s and their union had filed a complaint with the state department of health over the repossession of the embolism coils and what had happened to Sungida. He sat in his office at Boston University, unsure of what to think. He felt lost, even skeptical, but also distraught. Could this coil have saved her? Then he got a bill for the cost of her medevac to Boston Medical. Given what Nabil now knew about the coil, he wondered whether he was being asked to pay $1,076 for transport that should never have been necessary. His anger intensified when he received Sungida’s autopsy report from ­Boston Medical. It said she’d had placenta accreta, a condition that usually needs to be resolved by removing the uterus after birth. If true, that meant St. Elizabeth’s had missed it—yet another glaring shortfall, he thought, in Sungida’s care. He emailed the hospital’s chief medical officer, who in a subsequent briefing disputed the autopsy findings, insisting that there was no placenta accreta—and that her liver was the only problem. Sometimes, at night, he would hold Otindria close and whisper into the darkness: “Your childhood would be so different if it was the other parent.” Back home with Otindria, Nabil settled into a routine he repeated every three hours: feeding, fresh diaper, back to sleep. Scrolling Netflix one night, he came across the movie Fatherhood, which follows a dad (Kevin Hart) whose wife dies in a Boston hospital after giving birth to their daughter. The parallels felt uncanny. Hart’s character wrestles with whether to move home to the Midwest, where his mother can help care for the baby. Nabil faced the same dilemma. Sungida’s greatest hope had been for her girl to grow into an independent woman in a place where she would face fewer limits. But he was overwhelmed by the thought of caring for Otindria alone. He decided to go back to Dhaka. As he planned the move, Nabil thought often about how Sungida would have handled the situation so much better. She would have figured out a way to keep Otindria in America and put up a stronger fight to find out what had happened at the hospital. Sometimes, at night, he would hold Otindria close and whisper into the darkness: “Your childhood would be so different if it was the other parent.” If she had to lose a parent, he thought to himself, it should have been him. In the years before Sungida’s death, MPT acquired one Steward hospital after another, binding each facility to a high-rent lease. Steward began to cut costs even more aggressively. In 2017, it closed the maternity ward at a hospital in southeastern Massachusetts. The next year, it shut down Northside Regional Medical Center in Youngstown, Ohio, which housed the city’s only labor and delivery unit. In 2019, it closed its hospital in Phoenix and a neonatal unit in Easton, Pennsylvania. When the pandemic hit, it threatened to shutter the Easton facility altogether, demanding $40 million from the state to stay open—the governor granted $8 million. Steward took the money, closed the obstetrics unit, and sold the hospital three months later for $15 million. Steward’s other hospitals deteriorated, according to government proceedings. Janitors at its Haverhill, Massachusetts, facility were buying toilet paper for patients with their own money. At St. Elizabeth’s, nurses purchased specialized bereavement boxes for stillborn babies after the hospital ran out. In West Monroe, Louisiana, a nurse practitioner discovered that Steward had stopped paying its on-call cardiologist as the doctor was caring for a patient in the middle of a heart attack. The company seemed to be bleeding money: It reported losses of $207 million in 2017 and $271 million in 2018. During the pandemic, Steward claimed its largest loss ever—$408 million—despite record levels of government assistance. The company also faced a criminal inquiry in Malta, tied to a $4.35 billion contract it had won to operate three government hospitals in the island nation. Millions in taxpayer funds earmarked for improving the facilities seemed to disappear; Maltese officials sued Steward, accusing it of using the money for bribes and kickbacks and to “unjustly enrich itself.” (Their investigation is ongoing.) In some years, Steward hospitals made up more than a third of MPT’s assets and almost half of its revenue. If Steward died, it could take MPT with it. By the end of 2019, Cerberus executives began expressing concern to investors. Then, in May 2020, they engineered a complex transaction that transferred the firm’s $350 million stake in Steward to de la Torre and other Steward leaders as a loan, giving them five years to pay it back. Experts wondered whether this hinted at an impending collapse: In bankruptcy proceedings, lenders tend to get paid whereas stockholders don’t. (Cerberus has denied that this was its motivation.) MPT, too, was thinking about how to protect its bottom line. For the real estate trust, Steward’s survival was existential. In some years, its hospitals made up more than a third of MPT’s assets and almost half of its revenue. If Steward died, it could take MPT with it. Its solution was a top-secret plan executives dubbed “Project Easter,” according to internal documents obtained by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project. Publicly, MPT expressed optimism. In an early 2021 earnings call, CEO Aldag bragged that the company “has the strongest portfolio of hospitals in the world.” But privately, according to the OCCRP’s documents, MPT executives knew Steward was desperate for cash, so they devised a scheme that would keep it afloat while enriching executives of all three companies. In the summer of 2020, MPT purchased several Steward properties, pouring $400 million into the company. Six months later, it loaned Steward $335 million to help buy out Cerberus’ stake, bringing the private equity firm’s total profit from its ownership of Steward to $800 million. That same month, Steward paid its investors $111 million, which included about $83 million for de la Torre; MPT, which owned almost 10 percent of Steward, pocketed a cool $11 million. When MPT disclosed the deal in federal filings four months later, the financial press took notice. Not only was the deal “unusual,” per Bloomberg, but it revealed a growing private equity pattern, wherein a sort of Russian nesting doll of financiers work together to make money off struggling hospitals. After the Wall Street Journal and others wrote about the deal, Rob Simone, an investment analyst in suburban Connecticut, began seeing a surge of interest. Simone, 40, was a REIT specialist at Hedgeye, a research firm that does deep dives on stocks and sells them to portfolio managers. Suddenly, client after client was inquiring about MPT, which is publicly traded. Poring over the firm’s financial filings, Simone began to suspect that MPT was propping up Steward well beyond the Cerberus deal, an arrangement he called “a perverse marriage” when we spoke last year. He started publishing research to this effect, and laying out the details on Hedgeye’s YouTube channel in his crisp, fast-talking style. MPT had announced, for example, that it was investing $169 million in a new Steward facility in Texas. A bit of Googling revealed that the project was slated for Texarkana, a small city on the state’s eastern edge. This piqued Simone’s interest: Texarkana’s population was shrinking, and it already had a perfectly good hospital. Developing a pricey new one made no sense. By now, Simone knew MPT’s “special sauce” was buying up struggling safety-net hospitals, which are particularly vulnerable to the devil’s bargain of sale-leasebacks. Indeed, MPT’s high rents have cratered hospital systems in multiple states. Facilities can’t keep up, and they inevitably slash services or close down. Pipeline Health, for instance, declared bankruptcy in 2022, about a year after MPT bought its Los Angeles hospitals. A profitable community hospital in Watsonville, California, closed two years after MPT purchased it. “It’s just this long line of rinse and repeat of basically looting safety-net hospital systems,” Simone says. It occurred to Simone: What if all this new investment was just a way of funneling cash back into MPT’s trail of failing hospitals? MPT’s compensation scheme was also quite unusual for a REIT: Executive pay was tied to the dollar value of its acquisitions. The more hospitals MPT bought, and the more it paid for them, the more money the executives brought home. “You don’t just get compensated for paying the highest price, but also to go out and buy anything,” Simone says. “I knew right away when I saw that, this was going to be a bad outcome.” After each hospital system faltered, MPT would buy a new one and issue a flurry of press releases. It occurred to Simone: What if all this new investment was just a way of funneling cash back into MPT’s trail of failing hospitals? Wasn’t this similar to a Ponzi scheme, in that MPT brought on new tenants who could afford to pay the rent to help prop up the older ones who couldn’t? (In a letter to senators, MPT denied the allegation that it is a Ponzi scheme.) Simone hired a photographer to check out the Texarkana project. Financial statements said MPT and Steward were more than $50 million into the build, but the photographer sent back shots of an empty field. In one, a portable toilet lay toppled over. “$50 million was literally tumbleweeds,” Simone says. The photos further fueled his hunch that MPT was covering up Steward’s money problems by providing it cash that would come back to MPT as rent—payments MPT could then record as earnings to maintain a facade of business success. (In 2023, MPT commissioned an investigation that found no evidence of this.) Simone published his Texarkana findings, affirming his earlier recommendation that his firm’s clients should short MPT—bet on the future decline of its stock. Soon after, he received anonymous death threats. Trolls on X went after him incessantly, even posting his home address and the country club to which he belongs. But Simone’s reports motivated other analysts and short sellers to look into MPT. The most prominent was Viceroy Research, which had played a key role in exposing one of Europe’s greatest recent frauds—that of payment processor Wirecard, whose top executives now face criminal charges. In 2023, Viceroy expanded on Simone’s findings, claiming that one of the ways MPT seemed to funnel money to Steward was by dramatically overvaluing its hospitals, according to legal filings. Viceroy calculated that MPT may have overpaid Steward by at least $1 billion for its real estate. For example, it loaned Steward $1.4 billion to buy a chain of 19 hospitals, but soon ­forgave $700 million of the loan. In another case, Steward bought a Texas hospital for $11.7 million and sold it to MPT the same day for $26 million. (MPT sued Viceroy and claimed its underwriting process for determining hospital values is accurate. The case was settled in December.) There were other projects that seemed off. In 2021, Steward announced plans to build a state-of-the-art hospital in Utah, on a parcel of “trust land”—federally owned land bestowed to states to use for public benefit. To this day, the site remains an empty, overgrown field, yet another expensive project that may have existed only on paper. In 2022, Steward spent $60 million on a shuttered Miami hospital that it never reopened. (MPT did not respond to questions about its involvement in these hospital purchases.) But no amount of financial contortion could stop Steward’s downward spiral. As the hospital closures continued, dozens of lawsuits from staff and stiffed vendors piled up, and the federal government sued the company, alleging Medicare fraud. In September 2023, a sales rep marched into St. Elizabeth’s to repossess the embolism coils that, three weeks later, might have saved Sungida’s life. “I don’t think the regulatory apparatus was used to dealing with actors fueled by that kind of greed.” Simone is a finance guy, and his research is aimed at helping investors. But as a father of three, he never lost sight of the likely human toll of MPT’s accounting tricks. Without MPT propping it up, he says, “Steward would have become a bankruptcy years ago.” About five years, he figures—five fewer years of “patients dying, hospitals closing, vendors not getting paid…everything would have been pulled forward in time and ended.” In late January 2024, Nabil flew with ­Otindria to Bangladesh. Days later, the Globe published its story about ­Sungida’s death. It sparked a national reckoning. That’s “what finally blew the lid off all this,” a St. Elizabeth’s nurse told lawmakers at a subsequent Senate hearing. That spring, Steward’s bankruptcy proceedings revealed more details about its looting of patient care: It owed nearly $300 million in unpaid wages, including more than $105 million to doctors and $42 million to a single nurse staffing agency. It owed almost $1 billion to various vendors, including $79 million to suppliers of care items ranging from sterilization equipment to newborn test kits. Two Senate committees launched investigations into Steward and the broader trend of private equity in health care. Several states commenced their own accountability efforts—a blistering hearing in Louisiana, an investigation in Arizona, and a new law in Massachusetts that subjects private equity hospital owners to extra scrutiny and prevents them from selling hospital real estate to entities like MPT. Sen. Markey introduced a federal bill, though it has yet to move out of committee, that would regulate PE health care purchases. As Steward fell apart, so did Nabil’s vision of his future. He and Sungida had relished the idea of parenting on their own—the “American struggle,” they’d called it. Now he was back with his parents, who spent hours each day caring for Otindria. It wasn’t the life he’d imagined. He knows living in Dhaka has its benefits. His daughter will be adept in both Bangla and English. Her grandparents have become her best friends—each morning, Otindria drags her grandfather out on a walk to pet the neighborhood goat. But still, to Nabil, every day in Bangladesh feels like a small betrayal. “I didn’t want it to be her home, and her mother didn’t want it to be her home,” he told me. “That’s the broken promise that bothers me a lot.” St. Elizabeth’s was briefly engulfed by another private equity giant, Apollo Global Management, before Massachusetts seized it through eminent domain. He tries not to let it show. When I visited Dhaka in February, ­Otindria toddled through the apartment like a tiny queen, with Nabil as her cheerful attendant. He set up her Hello Kitty playpen in the living room, retrieved stuffed animals, and snuck her jalebi, a fried sweet, in between meals. Beneath the photos of Sungida that line most of the walls, he threw himself into playing with his daughter, never letting on that each parenting moment is tinged with sorrow. “I see ­Otindria doing everything Sungida would have wanted her to do,” he says. “But she’s not here to see it.” Nabil has grown angrier at the system that upended his life. In the spring of 2024, he began discussions with a law firm about suing Steward. (He is now pursuing a case as part of the bankruptcy.) A few months later, de la Torre—Steward’s now-former CEO—was spotted at the Olympics in Paris, attending the equestrian dressage competition at Versailles. Federal agents briefly detained him this past fall, serving a search warrant and seizing his phone—potential signs of a federal probe. But as of this writing, neither he nor anyone else involved has been charged with a crime. MPT continues to do its business with Aldag at the helm—in January, another of its hospital chains, Prospect, declared bankruptcy. ­Stephen Feinberg, the billionaire co-CEO of Cerberus, was recently sworn in as the No. 2 at the Pentagon. The 34 hospitals Steward owned when it declared bankruptcy are now in chaos. There have been hundreds of layoffs as new operators take control, and several closures. St. Elizabeth’s was briefly engulfed by another private equity giant, Apollo Global Management, before Massachusetts seized it through eminent domain and assigned ownership to Boston Medical Center—the same hospital system to which Sungida had been transferred. In October, thousands of miles from this tempest, Otindria turned 1. Sungida and Nabil had agreed during her pregnancy that they wouldn’t host a blowout for their daughter’s first birthday—it felt silly when she wouldn’t care or remember. But Nabil’s parents insisted on a party. Nabil usually rushes home from work to be with his daughter, but that night, he worked late on purpose: This birthday party felt like yet another detour from the couple’s plans, and he couldn’t stomach it—nor dissociate it from the worst day of his life. When he thinks about the future now, everything revolves around Otindria. He daydreams about teaching her to drive one day, just as he taught Sungida when they were graduate students. He isn’t worried about his daughter making good grades or getting into a top college—things Sungida would have worried about. All he wants for her is joy. “Be a chef, go to a party school, travel,” he says. “Enjoy your world.” Nabil no longer can say with any certainty that he and his daughter will leave Bangladesh when Otindria is older. He’d like to, but he’s loath to make any plans. “The future that I wanted imploded on me,” he says. “So now, I am scared to dream.” Correction, May 14: An earlier version of this story misstated when Pipeline Health declared bankruptcy.

Title: Nearly 7,000 workers are out as Microsoft confirms across-the-board layoffs
URL: https://qz.com/microsoft-lays-off-7000-workers-1851780460
Time Published: 2025-05-13T15:58:00Z
Full Content:
Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%) is laying off about 3% of its workforce, its largest headcount cut in more than two years. The layoffs have not been formally announced via press release or SEC filing but were first reported on Tuesday. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed to CNBC that it’s laying off about 3% of its global workforce. With around 228,000 employees worldwide, the move will impact nearly 7,000 people — making it the company’s largest round of layoffs since it cut 10,000 roles in early 2023. Microsoft framed the move as part of “organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” (What, not “vibrant” or “robust”?) Unlike a smaller round of performance-based cuts in January, these layoffs are not tied to individual performance. A Microsoft spokesperson said the company is working to reduce layers of management and adjust its structure amid ongoing platform shifts. The news comes just weeks after Microsoft delivered what Wedbush dubbed an “Aaron Judge-like” earnings performance that helped reset the narrative around AI monetization. Revenue hit $70.1 billion, up 13%, with Azure and other cloud revenue growing 33% year-over-year, a better clip than some analysts predicted. Nearly half of that cloud growth came from AI workloads. Microsoft stock is up around 6% year to date, and up over 200% since the pandemic-era stock lows of 2020. The tech industry has been through a sweeping labor reset since 2023, when giants like Amazon (AMZN-2.87%), Meta (META-2.36%), and Google (GOOGL-1.57%) began unwinding what some observers believed was pandemic-era overhiring. Amazon cut more than 27,000 roles in waves, Meta laid off over 21,000 employees during its so-called “year of efficiency,” and Microsoft eliminated 10,000 positions, marking its biggest workforce reduction in years. Google’s parent company Alphabet let go of 12,000 employees, while Salesforce (CRM-0.74%), Spotify (SPOT+5.12%), and Lyft (LYFT-1.87%) also trimmed deeply. By 2024, layoffs grew more selective as leadership leaned into artificial intelligence and long-term profitability. Mass cuts gave way to more surgical trims, with companies saying sayonara to low-priority initiatives or those misaligned with fresh strategic visions. Meta pulled back in Reality Labs and infrastructure, Amazon slimmed down parts of AWS and retail tech, and Salesforce restructured to “focus on the core,” often shorthand for shedding teams that no longer fit the investor story. While the headline-grabbing rounds mostly subsided, the pruning seems to have never really stopped. Tech firms have quietly kept reshaping their org charts, thinning layers, and reallocating headcount toward AI-driven bets. White-collar workers’ group chats everywhere remain alight with news of cuts or threatened cuts. Tuesday’s move by Microsoft slots cleanly into the narrative.

U.S. equities were mixed at midday, boosted by tech stocks and a new report showing consumer inflation came in lower than expected. The Nasdaq was up 1.5%, and the S&P 500 rose almost 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged lower as UnitedHealth Group shares tanked. Nvidia (NVDA) shares advanced as President Trump moved to open up the Saudi Arabia market to artificial intelligence (AI) chips from U.S. firms. First Solar (FSLR) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 after an upgrade from Wolfe Research, which pointed to the solar modules manufacturer's strength in the domestic market. Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI) gained when Raymond James initiated coverage with an "outperform" rating, calling the computer server maker a market leader in AI-optimized infrastructure. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares slumped when the health insurer suspended its guidance because of rising costs, and CEO Andrew Witty stepped down. The news dragged down shares of industry rivals as well. U.S.-listed shares of Honda Motor (HMC) slid after the Japanese carmaker warned new U.S. tariffs will negatively impact full-year results, and it postponed plans for building electric vehicles (EVs) and batteries in Canada because of falling demand for EVs. Enphase Energy (ENPH) shares declined on a downgrade and price target cut from Barclays. Analysts cited concerns about future demand for the firm's residential solar products. Oil and gold futures gained. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was higher. The U.S. dollar lost ground to the euro, pound, and yen. Prices for major cryptocurrencies were mixed, with bitcoin slightly higher. TradingView

Title: What's Behind The 300% Rise In AVGO Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/01/28: In this photo illustration, the Broadcom logo is seen displayed on a smartphone ... More screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Although Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) has seen an approximate 4% decline year-to-date, reflecting a broader decline in the NASDAQ index influenced by uncertain macroeconomic conditions, including ongoing tariffs and trade tensions, some of these worries have recently lessened. The landmark trade agreement between the U.S. and U.K., along with the recent 90-day pause in high tariffs between the U.S. and China, indicates a possible change in this situation. Despite this recent downturn, AVGO stock has achieved considerable long-term growth, rising over 300% since the beginning of 2023. This impressive performance is mainly due to the following factors: We will explore the details of these factors. While AVGO stock has performed remarkably well, if you are looking for an upside with a smoother experience than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P, achieving >91% returns since its inception. Broadcom’s remarkable recent performance is significantly due to two main factors: its rapidly growing AI product line and the strategic acquisition of VMware in 2023. This collaboration has instigated a noteworthy 64% rise in Broadcom’s revenue, increasing from $33 billion in 2022 to $55 billion over the last twelve months. A pivotal element contributing to this growth is the company’s AI revenue, which reached $12.2 billion in the fiscal year 2024, showcasing an impressive 220% year-over-year increase. This growth in AI revenue is propelled by robust market demand for Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators (XPUs) along with its Ethernet products. Through its extensive suite of networking and storage solutions, cybersecurity offerings, and semiconductor products, Broadcom has strategically aligned itself to make the most of the ongoing generative AI surge. Broadcom has consistently maintained an adjusted net margin exceeding 45% in recent years. This strong recent profitability is a result of its strategic engagement with the expanding AI market, especially through high-demand custom AI accelerators and networking solutions. The transformative acquisition of VMware has further enhanced revenue and margins by incorporating a substantial infrastructure software component with an emphasis on recurring subscriptions. Alongside continued strength in their core semiconductor business and a constant focus on operational efficiency and strong cash flow generation, these aspects have positioned Broadcom for enduring financial success. Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators (XPUs) have been a vital factor in the company’s financial transformation and a key element in its improved overall valuation. This effect is evident in Broadcom’s adjusted price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which has significantly increased threefold, from 14x in 2022 to 41x at present. This rise in investor enthusiasm was driven by the company’s enhanced financial performance, marked by strong sales growth and higher profitability. This financial change unfolded against a backdrop of a challenging market environment, particularly the inflation shock of 2022 that resulted in a substantial stock market correction. During this tumultuous period, AVGO stock saw a sharp 36% decline, dropping from its January 2022 peak of $67 to a low of $43 by October 2022. This decline was more significant compared to the S&P 500’s 25.4% peak-to-trough drop. AVGO’s recovery was gradual, only returning to its pre-crisis peak by May 2023, reflecting both the harsh market conditions and the company’s inherent resilience. Currently priced at $220, Broadcom’s stock holds a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 41, based on its trailing adjusted earnings per share of $5.36. This multiple is considered steep, and it is considerably higher than the stock’s three-year average P/E ratio of roughly 30x. Nonetheless, this premium valuation seems warranted due to the company’s substantial opportunities in the rapidly growing AI sector. These AI-driven developments are anticipated to support sales growth. While the company has demonstrated an average sales growth rate of 24% over the last three years, forecasts for the next three years expect mid-teens average growth. Notably, bottom-line growth is projected to be even more pronounced than the revenue increase. For long-term investors, any retreat in AVGO stock may signify an opportunity, considering the company’s strong fundamentals and positioning in the AI market. However, those apprehensive about near-term volatility should contemplate suitable strategies, such as the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio strategy, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, that has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the previous four-year span. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

May 13, 2025 09:45 ET | Source: FN Media Group LLC FN Media Group LLC PALM BEACH, Fla., May 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FN Media Group News Commentary - The Artificial Intelligence (Al) in cybersecurity market is rapidly expanding as organizations increasingly adopt Al-driven solutions to improve threat detection, prevention, and response to evolving cyber risks. The network security segment dominated the Al in cybersecurity market expansion in 2024 due to the critical need to safeguard organizational networks from evolving cyber threats. A report from an industry insider said that: “The global AI in cybersecurity market assessment, based on type, includes network security, endpoint security, application security, and cloud security. The network security segment dominated the AI in cybersecurity market expansion in 2024 due to the critical need to safeguard organizational networks from evolving cyber threats. Securing networks against malware, phishing, and ransomware attacks has become a top priority as enterprises increasingly adopt digital transformation initiatives and cloud-based infrastructures. AI-powered network security solutions excel in real-time traffic analysis, abnormality detection, and proactive threat mitigation, ensuring robust protection of sensitive data and operational continuity.

(NYSE: NET), the leading connectivity cloud company, recently announced a wave of global technology companies, including Asana, Atlassian, Block, PayPal, Sentry, Stripe, and more, are working with Cloudflare to create powerful AI experiences through Anthropic’s AI assistant, Claude. These software companies are enabling Claude and other AI assistants to securely interact with their services on behalf of users, through connections built on Cloudflare Workers. Now users can complete tasks and interact with their favorite business tools through natural conversations with Claude, rather than working directly in the application. AI is already transforming the way we work by helping to edit emails, generate code, and analyze data. However, it still often requires the user to switch between multiple applications, tabs, and tools to implement the actions it recommends. For truly autonomous, agentic AI experiences, AI tools should be able to act on the user’s behalf. That can only happen if AI tools can directly interact with business software tools. MCP servers allow AI platforms to connect directly to the popular tools where data resides so the user can send an email, answer a question about a marketing campaign, or create invoices–all without leaving the AI assistant. But delivering reliable, low-latency, and secure access to external tools and data is a significant technical challenge, especially at global scale.

May 13, 2025 09:45 ET | Source: FN Media Group LLC FN Media Group LLC PALM BEACH, Fla., May 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FN Media Group News Commentary - The Artificial Intelligence (Al) in cybersecurity market is rapidly expanding as organizations increasingly adopt Al-driven solutions to improve threat detection, prevention, and response to evolving cyber risks. The network security segment dominated the Al in cybersecurity market expansion in 2024 due to the critical need to safeguard organizational networks from evolving cyber threats. A report from an industry insider said that: “The global AI in cybersecurity market assessment, based on type, includes network security, endpoint security, application security, and cloud security. The network security segment dominated the AI in cybersecurity market expansion in 2024 due to the critical need to safeguard organizational networks from evolving cyber threats.

AI-powered network security solutions excel in real-time traffic analysis, abnormality detection, and proactive threat mitigation, ensuring robust protection of sensitive data and operational continuity. This essential role in securing core systems and communications highlights the network security segment's dominance. The global AI in cybersecurity market evaluation, based on application, includes identity & access management, risk & compliance management, data loss prevention, unified threat management, fraud detection/ anti-fraud, threat intelligence, others. The data loss prevention segment is expected to witness the fastest AI in cybersecurity market growth during the forecast period due to the rising emphasis on safeguarding sensitive and confidential information.” Active companies in cybersecurity news today include Cycurion Inc. (NASDAQ: CYCU), Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE: NET), Palo Alto Networks® (NASDAQ: PANW), Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO), CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD). The report continued: “Organizations face heightened risks of accidental leaks or intentional data breaches with increasing volumes of data being generated and exchanged.

(NYSE: NET), the leading connectivity cloud company, recently announced a wave of global technology companies, including Asana, Atlassian, Block, PayPal, Sentry, Stripe, and more, are working with Cloudflare to create powerful AI experiences through Anthropic’s AI assistant, Claude. These software companies are enabling Claude and other AI assistants to securely interact with their services on behalf of users, through connections built on Cloudflare Workers. Now users can complete tasks and interact with their favorite business tools through natural conversations with Claude, rather than working directly in the application. AI is already transforming the way we work by helping to edit emails, generate code, and analyze data. However, it still often requires the user to switch between multiple applications, tabs, and tools to implement the actions it recommends. For truly autonomous, agentic AI experiences, AI tools should be able to act on the user’s behalf. That can only happen if AI tools can directly interact with business software tools. MCP servers allow AI platforms to connect directly to the popular tools where data resides so the user can send an email, answer a question about a marketing campaign, or create invoices–all without leaving the AI assistant. But delivering reliable, low-latency, and secure access to external tools and data is a significant technical challenge, especially at global scale.

Title: Trump's trade agreement with China is another big win for investors

Hello there! Want to be a LinkedIn influencer? (Yes, that's a real thing.) A recent study that included interviews with more than two dozen influencers broke down the key things to remember when building that network. In today's big story, the stock market popped after a temporary trade agreement between the US and China was reached. We look at what some top Wall Street minds expect going forward. Don't forget to subscribe to Tech Memo, a weekly BI newsletter from Alistair Barr. Sign up here! What's on deck Markets: Check out five of Goldman Sachs' AI tools aiming to revolutionize how its employees work. Tech: Amazon is rekindling with its old flame FedEx, according to a document obtained by BI. Business: Costco's gold bars are such a hot commodity, the retailer put new limits on buying them. But first, another big win for investors. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. President Donald Trump's tariffs had investors heading for the hills. A little over a month later, they can't come back fast enough. An agreement between the US and China to significantly reduce tariffs for 90 days sent the market skyrocketing. Major indexes gained considerable ground, erasing the losses from Trump's April 2 "Liberation Day." In all honesty, we should have seen this coming. On May 8, Trump told a press pool at the White House, "You better go out and buy stock now." It was the second time in the past few months that Trump has telegraphed market-moving news coming down the pipeline by urging people to buy stocks. Now, investors who followed Trump's advice are sitting pretty. Tech stocks, including the all-important Magnificent Seven, were up big since many have supply chains and/or customers tied to China. And stocks weren't the only thing heading in the right direction. The progress made on US-China trade talks has people less fearful of a recession. Betting markets dropped the chances down to 40% from 52%, where it was last week. Can the stock market's good vibes last, though? That's what some of the brightest minds on Wall Street tried to think through when reacting to the news. Here's a rundown of their thoughts. Not to be a party pooper, but the trade agreement reached between the US and China is still only temporary. The two sides must iron out many issues before anything permanent is established. Let's not forget the actual tariffs. Both sides have significantly lowered the trade taxes against each other (China 125% to 10%, US 145% to 30%), but the risk remains. Fed Gov. Adriana Kugler said Monday that the current trade policies still "appear likely to generate significant economic effects even if tariffs stay close to the currently announced levels." Roger Altman, founder of investment bank Evercore, estimated the US's overall tariff rate is around 14% compared to 3-4% during President Joe Biden's administration. All of that is to say, the concerns economists have always had about Trump's trade policy — a rise in inflation, slower economic growth — are still very much on the table. 1. How Goldman Sachs is supercharging employees with AI. The bank's GS AI Platform has been growing its suite of tools aimed to boost employees' productivity. BI spoke with multiple Goldman executives over the past year and compiled intel on five of its AI tools. Here's everything we know. 2. Retirement travel dreams, deferred. BI spoke to several retirees who planned on spending their golden years traveling. Now, between rising costs and financial concerns, they said they're either finding creative ways to afford it or rethinking their plans altogether. 3. Another House representative made money on tariff turmoil. It's not just Marjorie Taylor Greene: Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz bought tens of thousands of dollars of stock during the market chaos in April. Both lawmakers say their trades were made by an outside financial advisor. 1. Amazon is getting back together with its (Fed)Ex. The two companies, which split in 2019, signed a partnership deal in late February, according to an internal document obtained by BI. Amazon cited FedEx's "cost favorability" over UPS, which previously said it would reduce its shipping volume for Amazon packages over profitability concerns. 2. The tortoise and the hare. Last week, Bill Gates announced plans to close the Gates Foundation in the next 20 years. Instead of the foundation winding down spending, he's ramping it up. It's a stark contrast to Elon Musk's chainsaw-wielding approach with DOGE — and Musk could take some notes. 3. The women powering little tech in 2025. Meet BI's Seed 40, our annual list of the best women early-stage investors with a knack for spotting and working alongside founders. This year's honorees have placed bets across some of 2025's hottest verticals, from AI to health tech. 1. Tariffs are going to hit Gen Z especially hard. In the face of tariff price hikes, Gen Z is already disadvantaged by having less wealth than other generations. But tariffs could hit some Gen Z-specific products to the point of extinction, from Korean beauty products to anxiety meds. 2. Costco tries to stem the gold rush. The wholesaler has been putting limits on purchases of gold and other precious metals in recent months. Gold prices have been on a tear this year, and even with earlier restrictions, Costco said its inventory had sold out "within a few hours." 3. Temu's left out of Trump's tariff reprieve. Although goods from China are being taxed at 30% and not 145% for the next 90 days, Temu and Shein are still subject to high duties which remain on small packages shipped directly from China. Fortunately, Temu has a workaround. Cannes Film Festival begins. The Business Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.

Title: Weight loss drugs are squeezing the food industry
URL: https://qz.com/ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-food-industry-sales-1851780090
Time Published: 2025-05-13T09:00:00Z

The revolutionary GLP-1 class of weight loss drugs are racking up blockbuster sales at a pace rarely seen in the pharmaceutical industry. But the pharma industry’s gain is the food industry’s loss. Approved for weight loss by the Food and Drug Administration just four years ago, Ozempic, Wegovy and other drugs in this category are now the best-selling medications in the United States. One in eight U.S. adults, some 30 million people, are taking the drugs, according to a new KFF poll. In survey after survey, users of the new weight loss drugs say they are cutting back on purchases of high-calorie foods and dining out less. As a result, Morgan Stanley (MS) predicts that overall consumption of soft drinks, baked goods, and salty snacks will fall 3% by 2035. One study that sent shudders through the food industry was an examination by researchers at Cornell University of purchases of 150,000 households. The study found that if one person was taking a GLP-1 drug, the household reduced its grocery spending by 5.5% within six months. Higher-income households reduced spending by 8.6%. The study by Cornell’s SC Johnson College of Business noted that the reductions were driven by large decreases in purchases of calorie-dense processed food, including an 11% decline in savory snacks. “Our findings highlight the potential for GLP-1 medications to significantly change food demand, a trend with increasingly important implications for the food industry as GLP-1 adoption continues to grow,” the researchers wrote. The changes are likely to last. In a recent survey of 1,700 consumers by the consulting firm Ey-Parthenon, respondents taking weight loss drugs said their consumption of snack foods dropped between 40% and 60%, while specialty and health food consumption climbed by almost 50%. “The survey results indicate that adoption (of GLP-1 drugs) will be rapid and long-lasting,” Ey said in its report. Restaurants may take a hit as well, according to a survey by the website Finance Buzz. More than half of those queried who were taking a GLP-1 drug said they spent less money on dining out since starting the medications, and 37% reported reduced spending on alcohol. GLP-1 drugs, also known by the generic name semaglutide, were approved for the treatment of diabetes some 20 years ago, but the category took off when it was discovered that they are extremely effective for weight loss, and with minimal side effects. The drugs mimic the GLP-1 hormone, which helps regulate appetite, and can reduce calorie intake by 20% to 30% daily. Given that some 40% of U.S. adults classify as obese, the potential market is huge. Plus, the drugs may be effective against a broad range of diseases. Scientists are studying them for the treatment of heart disease, addiction, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, symptoms of menopause, sleep apnea, and fatty liver disease. Sales are widely projected to soar from $15.87 billion in 2023 to anywhere from $100 billion to $150 billion by 2030. The drugs are costly however, running $1,000 a month and up in the U.S., and are often not covered by insurance, which limits their uptake. But prices are likely to drop as pharma companies develop oral versions of the drugs. That prospect already had food companies running scared more than a year ago. The CEO of Novo Nordisk (NVO), the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, said last year that food company executives were so “scared” they were calling him for advice on how to adapt to the new world of weight loss drugs. According to its recent survey of 300 patients taking GLP-1 drugs, Morgan Stanley said that “two-thirds of patients reported eating three or more snacks per day before starting the drugs, while 74% reported eating two snacks or less after starting the drugs.” There may, however, be an upside for those food companies that offer lower-calorie options. An October 2024 survey by PwC of some 3,000 U.S. adults found that, while GLP-1 users spent about 11% less on most categories of food, 56% said they were making healthier food choices. Shane Smith, CEO of packaged meats company Smithfield Foods, told a consumer conference in March that there is growing demand for meat among consumers who are taking weight-loss drugs. Based on scanner data, it is “snacks and sugary drinks and those types of things that they’re not buying,” Smith said. “But they’re really focused on maintaining a good level of protein and high-quality protein in their diet,” Smith said. “So, we think we’re set up well as we go forward.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: AST SpaceMobile: Satellite Service For Consumers Slated For Early 2026

PCMag editors select and review products independently. If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing. AST SpaceMobile is still playing catchup to SpaceX’s cellular Starlink system, but the company is racing to kick off its own service in about six months. AST CEO Abel Avellan mentioned the aggressive timeline in an earnings call on Monday. “The idea is to have a beta service sometime by the end of this year. A commercial service fully open for consumers sometime during early 2026,” he said. “Our plan is for this service to be text, internet, data, and access to applications like video conferencing.” SpaceX’s cellular Starlink system is already available to T-Mobile customers through a free beta program. In July, the carrier plans on officially launching the service as “T-Satellite,” which will cost $10 per month for most consumers, including those on rival carriers. In contrast, AST has only launched five “BlueBird” satellites for its own system when it needs at least 45 to 60 to begin offering continuous service across the US and other markets. In addition, the company still has to secure regulatory approval from the Federal Communications Commission before it can commercially offer the service to customers through key partners, including AT&T and Verizon. But in Monday’s earnings call, AST provided some details on how it plans to close the gap with SpaceX as both companies vie to provide satellite connectivity to cellular dead zones. In its presentation, the company said it plans on conducting five satellite launches over the next six to nine months. (The first launch, carrying a prototype next-generation BlueBird satellite, is scheduled for July though India's space agency.) In addition, AST anticipates “orbital launches every one to two months on average during 2025 and 2026," it said. The company is also on track to manufacture 40 second-generation BlueBird satellites for this year, "for over 50 satellites in total." However, AST executives declined to say how many satellites will be flown during each upcoming rocket launch. So the size of the initial constellation is unclear. That said, during the call, the company noted it only needs 25 satellites to start offering “non-continuous” service to users, meaning it can start generating revenue, but at the expense of coverage gaps. In other words, it looks like the company is betting it can operate around 25 satellites by the end of this year or early 2026. During the call, AST executives also said the company is paying more for its BlueBird satellites, partly because it's trying to move quickly to build the constellation. “The demand signals we are receiving is to get the service to market as fast as possible,” said AST President Scott Wisniewski. “So what you’re seeing is essentially a little bit of pull forward on launch, in a time when launch is harder to get, so we spent a little bit more than anticipated to get the timeline moving fast.” The other issue is that Trump’s tariffs are raising the costs for the raw materials to build the satellites. Each BlueBird satellite now costs up to $23 million to manufacture and launch, up from $19 million to $22 million. In a recent FCC filing, AST also noted its longer-term goal is operate 243 satellites by 2028. I've been working as a journalist for over 15 years—I got my start as a schools and cities reporter in Kansas City and joined PCMag in 2017.

Tesla (TSLA) shares surged Monday, pushing the company's market capitalization back above $1 trillion, amid a broad market rally after the U.S. and China agreed to temporarily lower tariffs. Shares of Tesla rose nearly 7% to close at $318.38 Monday, bringing the company's market cap to $1.02 trillion. That makes the Elon Musk-led automaker one of just nine American companies worth $1 trillion or more, along with Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B), and Broadcom (AVGO). Tesla's stock has climbed for three consecutive weeks, but the shares are still down more than 20% for 2025. The EV maker has faced a political backlash over CEO Elon Musk's involvement in the Trump administration's cost-cutting efforts, with shares erasing much of their gains in the wake of President Donald Trump's election win. Last month, Musk said he would step back from Trump's Department of Government Efficiency to spend more time with Tesla. Sales have lagged, including in China, where the company shipped fewer vehicles in April than it did a year earlier. Last month marked Tesla's seventh straight month of year-over-year declines in shipments from China, according to preliminary data from the China Passenger Car Association.

May 12, 2025 17:05 ET | Source: Village Farms International, Inc. Village Farms International, Inc. – Company to privatize certain assets of its Fresh Produce segment; enter supply agreements for retained assets – – Village Farms and private investment firms create privately held joint venture through transaction – – Village Farms’ Fresh segment to become cornerstone of NewCo’s commercial operations and growth strategy – – Village Farms expected to receive $40 million in cash proceeds; 37.9% equity ownership interest in NewCo – – VFF retains ownership of all Canadian cultivation assets; Marfa I and Monahans for future cannabis optionality – VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Village Farms International, Inc. (“Village Farms” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: VFF) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with a newly-formed holding company (“Vanguard Food LP” or “Vanguard”) backed by private investment firms including Sweat Equities, to privatize certain assets and operations of its Fresh Produce segment. The transaction will create a new, privately held joint venture with Village Farms as a minority owner, simultaneously enabling the Company to focus on its growing international business and repositioning its fresh produce business to flourish independently with new strategic capital partners. Village Farms’ Fresh Produce division will serve as the cornerstone of Vanguard’s commercial operations and growth strategy, transforming the business with supportive capital partners committed to executing a roll-up strategy of other leading North American produce brands and assets. Leveraging decades of Village Farms Fresh leadership in the cultivation, sales, marketing and distribution of produce to grocery stores and retailers, Vanguard will seek to expand its product categories and offerings for customers through M&A to create a premier branded CPG foods company supporting healthy lifestyles and sustainable farming practices. The parties have agreed to appoint Charlie Sweat, Founder of Sweat Equities, as Chairman of Vanguard’s Board of Managers. Mr. Sweat is the former Chief Executive Officer of Earthbound Farm, a leading organic foods company that transformed the organic salad category and grew from $10 million to over $540 million in annual sales during his 15-year tenure. Michael A. DeGiglio, Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Village Farms, has also been appointed to Vanguard’s Board of Managers and will serve as Interim Chief Executive Officer of Vanguard until a permanent replacement has been identified. Steve Ruffini, Chief Financial Officer of Village Farms, will also serve on Vanguard’s Board of Managers. Transaction Terms and Timeline Under the terms of the agreement, Village Farms will privatize its Texas-based, 40-acre Marfa II and 40-acre Fort Davis greenhouse assets, all of its produce-related intellectual property, with the exception of the Village Farms name, and transfer all of its produce distribution facilities, employees and operational control of these facilities to Vanguard. The transaction will be completed by way of a series of asset and lease transfers to Vanguard, and is expected to close during the second quarter of 2025, following the satisfaction of closing conditions. Consideration paid to Village Farms in the transaction will include 37.9 percent of the initial common equity units of Vanguard, and $40 million in cash. Village Farms will have no future cash obligations to Vanguard, and pre-emptive rights to maintain its ownership interest. Vanguard will remain a private company with access to additional capital to execute a M&A roll-up strategy. Management Commentary Michael A. DeGiglio, Chief Executive Officer of Village Farms, commented, “I am pleased to announce this transformative transaction for Village Farms, and very proud to work with Charlie Sweat and the team at Sweat Equities to drastically improve long-term upside potential for our produce business. Charlie is a proven industry pioneer with an incredible track record building enterprises across the health and wellness food categories and creating value for shareholders. We believe this transaction will unlock tremendous long-term value for both our businesses, and are excited to gain committed new capital partners in produce and to focus more of our resources toward advancing our leadership position in global cannabis.” Charlie Sweat, Founder of Sweat Equities, commented, “I have admired the achievements of Michael and the Village Farms team in our industry for decades, and am thrilled to form this partnership which will leverage Village’s commercial expertise to create a new leader in the fresh produce industry in North America. Securing a proven operating team like Village Farms was a critical first step for Vanguard, and we believe the industry and macro-economic environments are ripe to begin executing a strategy to drive accretive growth through M&A. The timing of this joint venture aligns perfectly with shifting consumer behaviors, and we’re positioned well to meet increased demand for healthier alternatives to processed foods.” Michael A. DeGiglio concluded, “Village Farms is all in on the future of cannabis globally, and we’re excited to begin this next chapter. This transaction monetizes one-third of our greenhouse assets, positions our produce business to thrive as an independent private entity, and provides significant expansion potential for us to continue building our leadership position and reputation as one of the largest and most respected scaled cultivators and marketers of cannabis on the planet.” Additional Information Upon completion of the transaction, Village Farms will continue to own its 30-acre Monahans greenhouse facility in Texas, and will own and lease its 20-acre Marfa I greenhouse facility in Texas to Vanguard. The Marfa I facility is currently expandable to 40-acres and is adjacent to 950 acres of unoccupied land owned by Village Farms available for future expansion, retaining significant long-term optionality for potential future cannabis expansion in the United States. In Canada, Village Farms will continue to own and operate its 60-acre Delta 1 greenhouse, 25-acre Delta 2 greenhouse, and 25-acre Delta 3 greenhouse, each of which are located in Delta, British Columbia. Village Farms will enter into service and supply agreements with Vanguard for fresh produce production in Delta, which will continue supplying produce for Vanguard for a multi-year term. The Delta 1 greenhouse generated approximately $25 million in fresh produce sales in fiscal year 2024. Approvals and Advisors The proposed transaction has been unanimously approved by the Board of Village Farms International. FTI Capital Advisors, LLC acted as financial advisor to Village Farms in connection with the proposed transaction. Torys LLP acted as legal counsel to Village Farms. Houlihan Lokey acted as financial advisor, and Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP acted as legal counsel to private investment firms including Sweat Equities. This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities. About Sweat Equities Sweat Equities is a private investment firm focused on investments in the health and wellness area with an emphasis on consumer goods in the food and beverage space. Sweat Equities is led by founder and managing principal, Charlie Sweat, and is made up of seven funds – a primary SE Fund LP with seven portfolio companies and six SPVs (Special Purpose Vehicles) totaling approximately $100 million of invested capital. The Sweat Equities model focuses on partnering with companies that can benefit beyond capital, leveraging the added value of the Sweat Equity team and its group of Advisors specializing in executive leadership, supply chain, operations/manufacturing, finance, sales and marketing, communications, and events. With the Village Farms partnership, Sweat Equities kicks off its Fund II capital raise, targeted at $300 million, focused on larger, mid-market companies versus the more emerging company markets in the first Funds. This initial Fund II investment carving out Village Farms fresh produce into a private entity, Vanguard Foods LLC, represents the first step in a fast and large M&A strategy to build a fresh foods platform bringing healthy, fresh foods to the market at scale. Sweat Equities will be reviewing various products and companies across many production methods when expanding the Vanguard platform. About Village Farms International Village Farms leverages decades of experience in Controlled Environment Agriculture as a large-scale, vertically-integrated supplier of high-value, high-growth plant-based Consumer Packaged Goods. The Company has a strong foundation as the leading and longest-tenured fresh produce supplier to grocery and large-format retailers throughout the US and Canada, but is now focused predominantly on leveraging its decades of agricultural expertise to focus on high-growth cannabinoid opportunities internationally. In Canada, the Company's wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, Pure Sunfarms, is one of the single largest cannabis operations in the world (2.2 million square feet of greenhouse production), the lowest-cost producer and one of Canada’s best-selling brands. The Company has an incremental 2.6 million square feet of greenhouse capacity available in Canada for future expansion, and also owns 80% of Québec-based, Rose LifeScience, a leading third-party cannabis products commercialization expert in the Province of Québec. Internationally, Village Farms is targeting selected, nascent, legal cannabis opportunities with significant medium- and long-term potential. The Company exports medical cannabis from its EU GMP certified facility in Canada to a growing list of international markets including Germany, the United Kingdom, Israel, Australia, and New Zealand. The Company is expanding its international presence with additional export contracts to new countries and customers across the globe, and is now making selective strategic investments in international assets. In Europe, wholly-owned Leli Holland has one of 10 licenses growing and distributing recreational cannabis products within the Dutch Coffee Shop Experiment. In the US, wholly-owned Balanced Health Botanicals is one of the leading CBD and hemp-derived brands and e-commerce platforms in the country. Subject to compliance with all applicable US federal and state laws and stock exchange rules, Village Farms plans to enter the US THC market via multiple strategies, leveraging its Texas-based greenhouse assets (5.5 million square feet of existing greenhouse capacity in West Texas), as well as the operational and product expertise gained through Pure Sunfarms' success in Canada. Village Farms Clean Energy (VFCE), through a partnership with Atlanta-based Terreva Renewables, creates renewable natural gas from landfill gas at its Delta RNG facility. VFCE receives royalties on all revenue generated. This partnership reduces Vancouver’s greenhouse gas emissions by 475,000 metric tons of CO2 per year, equivalent to removing more than 100,000 vehicles off the road or the energy use equivalent of powering 51,300 homes for one year.

Title: 4 Side Gigs Earn Up To $30k Annual Income For Full-Time Workers

ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D. ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D., Contributor. Side hustles are no longer optional in today's economy. Many American full-time workers need ... More lucrative side gigs like these to keep up with rising costs. Gig jobs are not longer optional in today’s tight economy. Amid the rise of financial uncertainty and inflation, more people are turning to flexible online work, including freelancing, e-commerce and AI-powered content creation to keep up with skyrocketing costs. One reason side gigs are becoming the new normal is that workers are tired of the stress and uncertainty in a job that could end at any moment. Side gigs give you the autonomy to be the captain of your own ship, instead of a passenger whose fate is determined by big business that might not have your best interests at heart. Statistics show that 71% of Americans are searching for secondary income sources through side gigs. As prices soar and the new administration continues making cuts, the economy is tightening, and AI advances are causing massive layoffs. Here are five reasons you need a side gig in the 2025 job market: to increase your income, reduce financial stress, gain more opportunities, enjoy more flexibility and save time with job searches. I spoke with Avery Morgan, CHRO at EduBirdie, and she told me that extra money isn’t really extra anymore, that it’s a necessity for many of today’s workers. “For many Americans, side hustles aren’t optional in today's economy, they help them to keep up with rising costs, uncertainty, and evolving career priorities.” Morgan cites statistics showing that nearly 39% of employed adults already earn extra income, and another 17% plan to join them soon. she points out that for 41% of workers, that extra cash already goes to make ends meet. “And with Trump’s tariffs projected to cost the average household $1,200 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, low- and middle-income Americans could be hit much harder,” she asserts. A new survey from the global online tutoring platform Superprof reveals a growing shift in how Americans are approaching side gigs. One in three survey respondents said they’re willing to dedicate five-to–10 hours a week to online work. Respondents say the top five online money-making activities they’re involved in are taking online surveys, online investing, freelancing, selling on e-commerce platforms and testing websites and apps. You can find more high-paying side hustles, requiring no experience here. Morgan argues that, if you think side hustles aren’t worth it, you’re wrong. She notes that in 2024, the average gig job brought in $891 per month (that’s over $10K per year), with nearly 19% of people earning over $1,000. The best part, she underscores, is that many of the side gigs can fit into your schedule without overwhelming your day job. She lists four lucrative side gigs that can earn top dollar: “Good writing skills are still in demand, no matter what they say about AI,” Morgan insists. “The ability to break down complex ideas and make engaging, thoughtful content can easily turn into a lucrative side hustle.” She points out that many coaches, executives or creatives are looking for someone to help them with their writing, such as LinkedIn posts, podcast scripts or online course modules. She emphasizes that they need this assistance on a regular basis, willing to pay about $500-$2500 per month. “You don’t need many clients to get started,” Morgan notes. “Just offer your services to people you know, or email someone directly on LinkedIn. If you have strong writing skills, it’s a great way to earn extra income remotely. Plus, you'll get to learn from industry pros and build valuable connections.” Morgan points out that an empty garage, parking space, shed or even your backyard can all be turned into extra income. “On platforms like Neighbor, Spacer or Peerspace, it’s simple: take a couple of photos, list a price and place an ad. A garage or shed can be rented out to store other people’s stuff, it can bring $50 to $300 a month. And your backyard can get you $100-$1000 per booking, if you host photo shoots or small events. Another option is to rent out things you have lying around, such as power tools, marquees, barbecues, sports gear or musical instruments. Altogether, it can bring from $500 to $2000 per month.” “If you like plants, try growing simple succulents or cacti at home. They are unpretentious and do not require much care,” Morgan recommends. “After one to two months, you will have accumulated mature plants you can use to make sets like ‘a gift for a colleague’ or ‘greenery on the desktop.’ She suggests selling them on sites like Etsy, eBay, or Amazon Handmade. ”It takes about $50 for pots, soil, and the first plants to get started," she explains. “From there, all you need is a little time for plant care and sorting out the delivery. Selling three to five kits a week at $20 to $40, you can make $300 to $1,000 a month doing this in your free time.” Morgan mentions that you can earn money simply by sharing your opinions on buying goods, services you use or just your experience. “These sessions are held online, often via video and typically take 30 minutes to an hour,” she explains. “You can get $50 to $250 per participation.” She recommends that you try sites like User Interviews, Respondent.io and Prolific, which target working professionals, parents or niche audiences. “To get started, just sign up, fill out your profile and respond to offers,” she advises. “Even if you only participate in 2-3 surveys a month, that’s already $200-300.” SideHustles.com advises employers and job seekers to prepare for a potential hiring surge starting this month. May is the peak month for people to quit their jobs, with 27% of resignations each year happening during the month of May. If you’re tight for income, side gigs can help you get ahead and stay on your feet in this fast-changing, uncertain economy.

Title: U.S.-China Tariff Thaw Sparks Stock Rally—Making Bezos, Musk And Zuckerberg More Than $40 Billion Richer

ByDerek Saul ByDerek Saul, Forbes Staff. Stocks surged across the board Monday as the U.S. and China’s trade war deescalated significantly, and the most valuable American companies largely slumping from the Beijing vs. Washington standoff roared back to life. Stocks surged Monday after a "dream scenario" for bulls emerged out of this weekend's U.S.-China ... More talks. This weekend’s talks between Washington and Beijing officials in Geneva culminated in both countries cutting their tariff for at least the next 90 days, with the U.S. slashing its duties on Chinese goods from 145% to 30% and China cutting its levies on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%. That led to a surge in global stocks as the most concrete evidence yet of Washington backing down from its most stark trade war plans, as the Hang Seng Index of Hong Kong-listed stocks soared 3% in Monday trading, with similar gains across U.S. indexes. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average popped 2.8%, or 1,160 points, while the benchmark S&P 500 jumped 3.3% and tech-concentrated Nasdaq ripped forward 4.4%. The Dow, S&P and Nasdaq closed at their highest levels since March 26, March 3 and Feb. 28, respectively. Leading the charge were the tech behemoths perhaps most reliant on a symbiotic relationship with the U.S. and China, as shares of Amazon (up 8%), Apple (6%), Nvidia (5%) and Tesla (7%) all outperformed the broader market. Also rallying were the stocks of fellow “magnificent seven” constituents Alphabet (3%), Meta (8%) and Microsoft (2%). $830 billion. That’s about how much market capitalization the aforementioned seven tech giants added Monday, led by Apple, Amazon and Nvidia’s more than $150 billion respective surges. Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company surpassed a $1 trillion valuation for the first time since late February during Monday’s rally. Tesla’s roughly $320 share price is still below its all-time high of nearly $490 set in December as investors flooded into the stock in anticipation of what Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration may mean for his company. Already the richest person in the world, Musk enjoyed an $11 billion bump to his net worth as Tesla shares rallied, extending his fortune to $407 billion, according to Forbes’ latest estimates. The planet’s second-wealthiest person Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Earth’s third-richest person Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg enjoyed $14 billion and $16 billion respective net worth bumps, though both men are still more than $180 billion poorer than Musk. The U.S.-China deescalation was a “huge win for the bulls,” remarked Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a Monday note to clients, saying the dramatic lowering of tariffs was a “dream scenario” for the U.S. tech industry. As investors fled into riskier stocks, assets viewed as safe havens from the tariff-induced market slump struggled. Gold prices tumbled 3% to below $3,240 per troy ounce, the lowest level since April 10 and the largest single-day loss since November. Yields for 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury notes spiked by about 10 basis points apiece Monday, with the higher yields signifying less valuable bonds as the safe returns of Treasuries prove less appealing in a more friendly operating environment for public companies. The S&P is up almost 20% from its early April nadir, just ahead of President Donald Trump’s first tariff blink, but the U.S. equity yardstick is still down 3% since Trump’s January inauguration. Trump campaigned on raising tariffs and targeted Canada, China and Mexico with country-specific actions in his first two months, but the country-by-country tariffs he laid out during his April 2 “Liberation Day” event were far more hawkish than Wall Street anticipated. The S&P tanked 12% in the five trading sessions following that speech, which led to a chorus of economists warning the sudden, sharp rise in import costs could send the U.S. into an avoidable recession. Trump began to loosen his tariff belt April 9 when he paused much of the most severe duties for 90 days, though he didn’t show much leeway on Chinese levies until last week, when he floated an 80% tariff on Chinese goods, nearly three times as severe as the rate announced Monday. Apple, Nvidia and Tesla are among the American companies with the heaviest revenue exposure to China, which accounted for at least 17% of each of those companies’ 2024 sales, while Amazon relies on China as half of its third-party sellers originate from the country. Public companies mentioned “tariffs” on earnings calls this quarter more than twice as much as they did during any quarter in Trump’s first term, according to Morgan Stanley research, evidence of the more heightened concerns on bottom lines from this round of tariffs.

Title: iPhone 13 Catches Up with Satellite Support in iOS 18.5 Update

The iPhone 13 has so far missed out on Apple’s satellite features, such as Emergency SOS and Messages via Satellite. But a new iOS update opens the door for the company's older smartphones to receive satellite connectivity through their mobile carriers. With iOS 18.5, out today, all iPhone 13 models get "support for carrier-provided satellite features." Previously, the carrier-provided satellite connectivity was restricted to the iPhone 14 through 16 models. But Apple has since updated its support page to add the iPhone 13. The satellite connectivity can be useful if you end up in an area without traditional cell service. Instead, your phone can communicate through orbiting satellites, giving you a way to receive a signal even in a cellular dead zone. For US users, the iOS 18.5 update paves the way for iPhone 13 models to receive connectivity through T-Mobile’s cellular Starlink service with SpaceX, which is slated to launch in July. "Yes. Once iPhone 13 users upgrade to iOS 18.5, T-Satellite will be available to them," T-Mobile told PCMag, later adding: "Our teams are pushing an update out on our support page this week to reflect the iPhone 13 change (and Samsung Edge)." The cellular Starlink service will cost $10 per month and promises to offer SMS messages in cellular dead zones, before expanding to voice calls and data. Prior to July's launch, T-Mobile has been offering customers, including those on rival carriers, free access to the satellite system as part of a beta program. The so-called “T-satellite” service also supports the iPhone 14, 15 and 16, along with certain Android devices such as Pixel and Samsung phones. The same iOS update could help AT&T and Verizon bring their own satellite services to the iPhone 13. Both carriers are working with another company called AST SpaceMobile to develop a rival next-generation satellite service to counter the cellular Starlink system. But AST’s service might not begin serving consumers until 2026.

Title: Trump's push for lower drug prices is just asking Big Pharma to make less money

Pharma stocks rebounded and rose into the green Monday afternoon after details of President Donald Trump’s executive order on drug prices became public. The order does not include a legal mandate that pharmaceutical companies lower prices in the U.S., The New York Times (NYT+0.23%) reports. Instead, it asks pharma firms to voluntarily lower their prices. Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY+0.74%) were up 2.4% Monday afternoon, after being down 2% earlier in the day. Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.61%) stock had climbed 2% by midday, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ-0.53%) stock gained 0.2%, and Novartis (NVS-0.56%) stock was about even on the day. Pfizer (PFE+1.72%) was up 3.1% and Merck (MRK-0.30%) gained 5.2%. Pharma stocks had fallen earlier Monday before the details of the executive order became known. The executive order said the Trump administration would consider taking regulatory actions or importing drugs from other nations if drugmakers don’t lower prices voluntarily, according to The Times. The order also called on federal agencies to look into why European countries get lower prices, and to attempt to get them to pay more. “I’m not knocking the drug companies,” Trump said before signing the order Monday. “I’m really more knocking the countries than the drug companies.” Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social late Sunday that the U.S. would pay the same price as the nation that pays the lowest price under a new “Most Favored Nations Policy.” He followed that up with a post Monday saying drug prices would fall by 59%, though he did not specify how he arrived at that number. Trump tried unsuccessfully to enact a similar measure in his first term that would have applied to about 50 popular drugs covered by Medicare. The plan was blocked by a federal court that ruled the administration had taken shortcuts in the policymaking process.

Pharma companies were mostly left out of the stock market’s broader rally Monday morning on the news that President Donald Trump would sign an order lowering some drug prices. A surprise trade agreement between the U.S. and China on Monday morning sent stocks soaring. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq were all up 2.5% or more in the first 30 minutes of trading. But pharmaceutical stocks weren’t invited to the party, after Trump said Sunday night that he would sign an executive order lowering drug prices in the United States. Trump signed the order Monday morning. Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY+0.74%) were down 2% Monday morning, even after a new study found the company’s weight loss drug, Zepbound, beat Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy in a head-to-head trial. Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.61%) was down 1.9% Monday morning. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ-0.53%) was down 0.4%, while Novartis (NVS-0.56%) was down 0.5%. Pfizer (PFE+1.72%) was a rare pharma bright spot, up 2.2%. “Prescription Drug and Pharmaceutical prices will be REDUCED, almost immediately, by 30% to 80%. They will rise throughout the World in order to equalize and, for the first time in many years, bring FAIRNESS TO AMERICA!” Trump posted to his Truth Social app on Sunday night. The president wrote that under a new “Most Favored Nations Policy,” the U.S. would pay the same price as the nation that pays the lowest price. He said he would sign the executive order on Monday. Trump followed that up with a post Monday morning claiming that drug prices would be reduced by 59%, though he didn’t specify how he arrived at that number. Americans often pay much higher prices for drugs than people in other nations. A committee found last year that the net cost of Ozempic, for example, was $600 per month in the U.S., compared to $92 in the U.K. and $59 in Germany.

Title: Eli Lilly's Zepbound beat Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy in a big weight loss drug study

Eli Lilly’s (LLY+0.74%) and Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+1.61%) weight loss drugs went head-to-head in a weight loss study for the first time — and Eli Lilly’s drug came out on top. Participants who took Eli Lilly’s tirzepatide, which is sold as Zepbound, lost 50 pounds on average, while those using Novo Nordisk’s semaglutide, also known as Wegovy, lost an average of 33 pounds. The study was funded by Eli Lilly and published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The trial included 751 participants, all Americans who were considered overweight or obese and had at least one other weight-related health issue. They received weekly injections of the highest tolerated dose of either drug. The participants who took Zepbound lost an average of about 20% of their body weight at the end of the 72-week trial, while those who took Wegovy lost about 14% of theirs. About 32% of people taking Zepbound lost at least a quarter of their body weight, compared to about 16% of those taking Wegovy. “These data confirm Zepbound as a leading treatment option for people living with obesity and equip healthcare providers with critical insights to make well-informed treatment decisions as part of a comprehensive obesity care plan,” Leonard Glass, Eli Lilly’s senior vice president of global medical affairs, said in a statement. Eli Lilly stock fell about 1% in Monday morning trading, after President Donald Trump signaled plans Sunday for an executive order aimed at lower prescription drug prices. Novo Nordisk stock was down about 0.4%. Participants in both groups had improvements in health factors like blood pressure, blood fat, and blood sugar levels as they lost weight. Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly had released top-line results of the study back in December, before they were peer-reviewed. This was the first time the study was published in full. The rise of GLP-1 drugs, which mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, has been a major boost for Lilly and Denmark-based Novo Nordisk, making them the most valuable pharma companies in the world. A number of cheaper, compounded versions have also made it to market, though the FDA has begun cracking down on them since the drugs are no longer considered to be in shortage. —William Gavin contributed to this article.

ByJohn Dorfman ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir Technologies, speaking in April in Washington DC. Photo by Kevin ... More Dietsch/Getty Images. A 446% gain in Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) propelled Christy Anderson to a victory in the 2024-2025 running of Dorfman’s Three-Stock Derby, an annual stock-picking contest. Anderson, a resident of Las Vegas, Nevada, is chief operating officer for a small company that makes radio frequency amplifiers with military applications. As such, she became familiar with Palantir, an analytical software company whose Gotham platform is used by the U.S. military and Western-allied nations. Her company doesn’t do business with Palantir, and she doesn’t own the stock. In fact, Anderson doesn’t own any stocks. “The stock market to me is just gambling,” she says. “I’m very intrigued by it though. I look at stocks every day.” Anderson also picked Novo Nordisk AS (NVO), a Danish pharmaceutical company, and Hive Digital Technologies Ltd. (HIVE), which mines digital currencies. Both suffered losses, but her gain on Palantir was so huge that she ended with a 121% combined return, easily capturing first place. Palantir is “probably overpriced now,” Anderson says. “They don’t really have the revenue to justify their market price.” When she entered the contest, she wrote that ”the number of military hotspots continues to grow,” and that the military “will need an increasing number of unmanned assets.” Anderson expects that the stock market will be volatile in the coming year, and will be little changed a year from now, after a lot of ups and downs. Donny Sanders, an accountant in Worcester, Massachusetts, took second place with an 82% gain. All three of his selections rose, led by Strategy (MSTR) with a 149% advance. Tesla Inc. (TSLA) chipped in a 58% gain, while iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) gained 39%. Of the three stocks, Sanders actually holds only one, Tesla. He doesn’t own a Tesla car, but “might get one eventually,” he says. He regards the car as “a super piece of technology.” Sanders doesn’t have a strong guess as to what the market will do in the coming year. “Hold for the long term, that’s my motto,” he says. Ronald Robinson, a retiree in Pahrump, Nevada, took third place with a 48% combined gain on his three choices. Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) led the way, with a 107% gain. Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) returned 25% and Energy Transfer LP (ET) 11%. Robinson formerly worked for a transportation company in Alaska. He invests in stocks “just for kind of fun,” he says. Robinson is optimistic about the market for the coming year. Lately, he says, the market has been “based on negative news. If the negative news can simmer down, I think the market will be good.” He thinks the U.S. and China will probably reach “some kind of agreement” on trade. Of 34 contestants, three saw all three of their picks go up. They were Sanders, Robinson, and Larry Weiner, a real estate agent in Las Vegas. Eighteen contestants notched positive returns, and 16 showed a loss. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index was up 6.8% for the contest period. You are welcome to enter the next running of Dorfman’s Three-Stock Derby. This will be the 18th stock-picking contest I have run, and the ninth in which contestants have to pick three stocks, not just one. To enter, send me: Email me your entry at jdorfman@dorfmanvalue.com. Or mail it to John Dorfman, Dorfman Value Investments, 101 Federal Street, Suite 1900, Boston MA 02110. Entries must be postmarked or time stamped by midnight May 31, 2025. The contest period will be from the market close on that date through the close on April 30, 2026. If you finish in the top three, I will want to interview you on short notice and possibly on a weekend, so the phone numbers are important. You do not need to own the stocks you select, but it’s fine if you do. Stocks must be traded in the U.S., but need not necessarily be U.S. companies. Short sales are permitted but not encouraged, since I have a separate short-selling contest. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are permitted. There’s no fee to enter. The winner will receive a $100 gift certificate to the restaurant of her or his choice. Disclosure: I own Novo Nordisk personally and for most of my clients.

Shares of tech firms surged in early trading Monday after the U.S. and China agreed to temporarily slash tariffs while they work out a long term deal. All of the Magnificent Seven stocks—Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Amazon (AMZN)—advanced along with global indexes on the de-escalation of the trade war with China. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) was up 4% shortly after the markets opened. Shares of chipmakers Marvell Technologies (MRVL), Broadcom (AVGO), Intel (INTC), and AMD (AMD) also rose sharply. Tech stocks had gotten hammered after President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement in early April prompted one of the worst stock sell-offs in decades, with Apple shares losing 16% of their value in their worst 2-day stretch since September 2008.

Title: The Dow surges 1,000 points and the Nasdaq soars 4% as the U.S. and China call a trade war truce

U.S. stocks soared Monday after Washington and Beijing struck a surprise deal to dramatically cut tariffs, marking a rare moment of clarity and good news in an otherwise volatile environment. The agreement, announced early Monday after weekend talks in Switzerland, includes a 90-day pause on new tariffs and sharp rollbacks on existing duties — moves that sent stocks skyrocketing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day up 1,160 points, or 2.8%. The S&P 500 rose almost 3.3%, and the Nasdaq soared about 4.4% as tech stocks led the market relief rally. One analyst called the tariffs deal a “dream scenario” for tech. Under the truce, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will fall from 145% to 30%, while China will cut duties on American goods from 125% to 10%, both for an initial 90-day window. The rollback is far more aggressive than many expected and signals what negotiators described as “substantial progress” toward a longer-term resolution. For markets, it’s a welcome reprieve from geopolitical brinkmanship. As Monday’s market movement made clear, the deal is functioning as a pressure release for investor fears, not to mention a global supply chain that’s been creaking and grinding under the strain. The sharp rally in major indexes further reflected that pivot, with the Nasdaq leading the charge and tech stocks in particular benefitting from easing supply chain constraints. The Magnificent 7 tech stocks rallied, with Amazon (AMZN-2.87%) up 8.1%, Apple (AAPL-0.39%) adding 6.3%, Nvidia up 5.4%, and Tesla (TSLA-3.33%) rising 6.8%. Wedbush analysts called the deal a “huge win for the market and bulls,” noting that the cuts likely take a near-term U.S. recession “off the table.” Analysts at the firm now expect the focus to shift from the economic doom-and-gloom of the past six weeks toward a more normalized growth outlook. Other analysts questioned the point of all the upheaval. Either way, the path forward is not entirely clear. Major issues remain unresolved, particularly restrictions around advanced chips and AI hardware, including Nvidia’s (NVDA-1.54%) H20 chips. But for now, the tariff thaw marks a major inflection point. Investors will have plenty more to chew on this week, with a host of economic indicators set to land and the last major earnings report of the first quarter set to hit as well. Walmart (WMT+0.77%) results are due Thursday and should provide an inside look at consumer sentiment, especially among hard-pressed American households.

Title: Time To Buy META Stock After The U.S. China Trade Deal?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. MUMBAI, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA - 2025/05/02: Meta logo is seen at their stall during the World Audio ... More Visual & Entertainment Summit (WAVES) event in Mumbai. (Photo by Ashish Vaishnav/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Following positive developments in U.S.-China trade negotiations, Meta stock (NASDAQ:META) is trending upward, showing a 7% gain in pre-market trading. This surge is likely driven by the announcement that both nations have agreed to a 90-day pause on tariff increases and a significant reduction in existing tariff levels. Specifically, reciprocal tariffs are set to decrease by 115%, from the current 125% to 10%. Previously, investors had expressed concerns about the potential impact of tariffs on Meta Platforms. Meta's business model necessitates significant infrastructure scaling to support its algorithms, power Reels, and advance its growing AI capabilities. Higher tariffs would have increased the cost of this infrastructure development. Coupled with anxieties regarding a possible pullback in advertising spending, this created a worrisome outlook for the company. However, the newly announced 90-day tariff pause is being viewed favorably by investors, alleviating some of these immediate concerns. Furthermore, the substantial tariff reduction signals a potential breakthrough in trade discussions, indicating a shared desire to ease trade tensions. Market attention will now turn to whether this development signifies the start of a more comprehensive and lasting trade agreement. Also, see – Is The U.S.-China Trade War Over? Beyond these macroeconomic factors, META stock appears to be an attractive investment at its current pre-market price of approximately $630. We believe that the concerns surrounding META stock are currently minimal, making its high valuation justified. Our positive assessment is based on a comparison of META's present valuation against its recent operating performance, as well as its current and historical financial health. Our analysis across key metrics—Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience—indicates that Meta Platforms exhibits very strong operating performance and a robust financial condition, as will be detailed subsequently. However, for investors who seek lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – Will AI Really Disrupt Google’s Search Empire? Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, META stock looks expensive compared to the broader market. Meta Platforms’ Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Meta Platforms' profit margins are considerably higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Meta Platforms' balance sheet looks very strong. META stock has seen an impact that was slightly worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Meta Platforms' performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: META stock demonstrated strong performance across the key parameters we analyzed. While its valuation of 9.7x trailing revenues is on the higher end, this appears justified by its accelerating sales growth and improving profitability. In light of these strong fundamentals, and now considering the positive momentum generated by the U.S.-China trade talk developments and the 90-day tariff pause, we believe that META stock still presents a compelling buying opportunity for substantial long-term gains. While META stock looks promising, investing in a single stock can be risky. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

See which delivers better ad copy, images, and video. Every day, marketing teams face a crucial decision: Should they rely on Google’s built-in AI tools or invest in custom solutions for specific ad campaign tasks? I’ve watched this debate play out countless times with clients. Google continues adding more AI features for tasks like ad copy generation, headline creation, image generation, and product feed optimization. Meanwhile, specialized tools and custom solutions are thriving, and no real breakthrough for Google AI can be seen. Recent research supports this tension. Gherheș et al. (2025) found that while AI-generated content can outperform human-created alternatives in certain contexts, the quality varies significantly depending on implementation and purpose. Their study revealed that over 50% of users preferred AI-generated informative content over sensationalized approaches, suggesting that how AI is deployed matters more than the technology itself. But which approach actually delivers better results? And at what cost? As Pavlik (2024) notes in his analysis of AI in journalism, tools like ChatGPT don’t simply replace human creativity but rather present opportunities for “improving the quality and effectiveness” of creative work when properly integrated into existing workflows. A recent study by Ameet Khabra compared the performance of human-written versus AI-generated ad copy in Google Ads campaigns. Over an eight-week period with a $500 budget, human-crafted ads significantly outperformed AI-created content from Copy AI, achieving 60% more clicks, a 1.33% higher click-through rate, and a lower cost per click ($4.85 vs. $6.05). Researchers attributed human copywriters’ superior performance to their ability to understand audience emotions, employ creativity and emotional appeal, adapt to specific contexts, and leverage cultural nuances that AI still struggles to replicate. While acknowledging AI’s evolving capabilities and potential value as a supplementary tool, the study emphasizes the enduring importance of human creativity in crafting compelling advertising messages that drive engagement and conversions. Regardless of these mixed research findings, one thing is certain: AI is increasingly embedded in creative processes across marketing, and its integration is inevitable. The question isn’t whether AI will play a role in advertising creation, but rather how marketers can best leverage these tools to enhance their campaigns. As AI capabilities evolve rapidly, today’s limitations may be tomorrow’s strengths. With this inevitability in mind, marketers need practical guidance on navigating the current landscape of available solutions. This article compares Google Ads integrated AI tools against third-party and custom solutions for creative and optimization tasks specifically. Google’s AI text generator aims to streamline the ad creation process by converting basic product descriptions into campaign-ready assets. The platform encourages advertisers to input unique selling propositions and key product features to generate contextually relevant ad copy. Upon testing this tool with a simulated video game business specializing in refurbished PlayStation 5 consoles and games, the performance fell notably short of expectations. The output quality was inconsistent, but more concerning were the significant compliance issues observed. In one particularly problematic instance, the system generated the phrase “Welcome to the Amazon® Website” as suggested ad text, presenting a clear trademark infringement risk and potential legal exposure for advertisers. Such critical errors highlight a fundamental limitation in Google’s native AI solution: While offering workflow convenience, it demonstrates inadequate safeguards for brand compliance and legal protection. The system also produced contextually inappropriate messaging, such as “PlayStation 5 Problems Solved,” which misaligned with sales-oriented campaign objectives by suggesting repair services or technical support rather than product offerings. Without careful human review, these problems make the tool risky to use, especially for businesses in competitive markets where mistaken identity or inaccurate representations could lead to serious legal issues and damage to your reputation. When generating longer headlines, there were much fewer results. Only three ad suggestions appeared, one of which included free shipping information for orders over $50, which was a hallucination, as this information was never disclosed in the prompt or the landing page. Creating descriptions was even worse, as there was only one ad suggestion and not even a good one from a copywriting perspective. After trying with different prompts, I was able to get at least five new descriptions out of Google AI. Still, the results were quite disappointing. The ad copy contained hallucinations like the “free shipping over 100 USD,” as well as the business name “Example Video Games,” instead of using the business name of the account or extracting it from the landing page or URL. Overall, underwhelming results, considering Google is one of the biggest companies on earth and owns the biggest online advertising platform. While Google’s AI text generator struggles with brand accuracy and contextual relevance, several general-purpose AI models offer more sophisticated ad copy creation capabilities that balance automation with quality control. Leading general AI assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini represent compelling alternatives for marketers seeking higher-quality ad copy generation. Unlike Google’s more constrained system, these platforms offer greater flexibility in handling nuanced prompting and brand-specific requirements. In testing with our video game business scenario, we prompted each model to create headlines for refurbished PlayStation 5 consoles. The results demonstrated significant advantages over Google’s native offering: All three models demonstrated superior context awareness compared to Google’s native tool, with each showcasing different strategic approaches to headline creation. They successfully avoided the hallucinations and brand confusion issues observed in Google’s Ad tool, while providing greater headline variety tailored to different marketing objectives. The key advantage these general AI assistants offer is their adaptability and more refined understanding of marketing language. By providing detailed prompting with brand guidelines, target audience information, and specific messaging requirements, marketers can achieve significantly better results than with Google’s more limited integrated tool. For businesses where ad copy directly impacts conversion rates, leveraging these more sophisticated AI options can yield higher-quality creative assets that better represent brand positioning and speak more effectively to customer needs. Despite Gemini’s relevant headline ideas, it struggled to adhere to the 30-character limit for some prompts on Google Ads headlines – a surprising limitation given that Gemini is Google’s own AI model and would be expected to understand Google Ads guidelines inherently – while Claude and ChatGPT consistently produced properly sized headlines without major additional editing or truncation. Image generation is another area where AI can really shine and reduce the workload. Images are a core asset in ecommerce, not only used for product images, but also for category pages, shop banners, display ads, and more. For our virtual video game business, I tried to create some images matching our PlayStation 5 asset group. The results were interesting to say. The first created image looks very similar to an Xbox. Specifically, an Xbox One S or an Xbox Series S, which is the latest model. Now, there are no logos or trademarks seen, and the form factor is a little off. Even more interesting, depending on the exact prompt, Google AI shows an error message related to branded items and content restrictions. Another image created looks a little more like a PlayStation, but not as described and advertised as a PlayStation 5, but rather an older PlayStation 4 model. Again, the content restrictions are most likely responsible for the results. While the image results are somewhat disappointing for those branded items, it is understandable that Google AI follows content restrictions and brand guidelines to avoid any legal issues, as the PlayStation is a trademark of Sony, and the Xbox is a trademark of Microsoft. It’s interesting to see that Google AI tries to work around this limitation and still creates an image, but in that specific case, the image is more or less useless, as there is little value in showcasing a non-existent video game console. A question here would be why the content restrictions and guidelines did not apply to text creation when the text asset “Welcome to the Amazon® Website” was created. To check the image creation quality, I tried a different approach for non-branded items in the dog food category. The image is good at first glance since multiple products are shown with a dog in the picture, supporting the category, but some things are off. The text in the image is still a mess for Google AI. Plus, the proportions are wrong. The dog is way too small, considering the cans of dog food displayed, which are small items. Better than video game consoles, but still not good enough to rely solely on Google AI without any backup or alternative. Using the same prompts to create images, ChatGPT delivers amazing results compared to the Google Ads integrated image creator. Visually, it was able to recreate a PlayStation video game console with a gaming controller. ChatGPT even got details right, except the brand logo, which might be due to some brand protection measures. Also, the latest Xbox model was created with in-depth details. This time, even the Xbox logo was created, maybe because ChatGPT and Microsoft have made a trademark deal of some sort? Or trademark restrictions have some loopholes. At last, the creation of the dog food image was also a success. The prompt included the brand to be named “Doug’s Best Dog Food,” which was perfectly written on the product, along with a nicely placed bowl full of pellets in front of a golden retriever. In comparison, Google AI was able to create a decent image, but upon closer look, issues with displaying words were apparent, which ChatGPT could handle perfectly. Qwen is an image generation tool based on Deepseek, which is a Chinese-based AI developer. The image from Qwen clearly had an “AI” look compared to the ChatGPT or Google AI image. However, it got the brand name “Doug’s Best Dog Food” right. With some improvements, Qwen can produce decent images, if you are okay with having a digital image look. Google AI was able to create a more real-life looking image, with the downside of not being able to display the brand name correctly. Google’s built-in video creation tool aims to make video advertising accessible to marketers without production resources. The tool covers multiple marketing objectives – from brand awareness and consideration to direct sales and app promotion – accommodating various business categories, including apps, products, and services. It offers flexibility with vertical, square, and horizontal formats in lengths ranging from quick six-second spots to 15-second and longer videos. However, the tool’s output quality reveals its limitations. Most videos are essentially slideshows, stitching together static images, logos, and text overlays rather than fluid video content. While this approach democratizes video ad creation, the results often lack the polish and engagement power of properly produced video content. For many marketers, this represents the fundamental tradeoff of Google’s native tools: accessibility and integration vs. creative limitations that might impact performance. At best, marketers get a nice-looking slideshow; speaking of a serious advertising video would be too much. The better templates are mostly for app-related videos, where at least some kind of animation is included with a finger doing some phone touch gestures. Overall, the native video creation tool serves as a backup for marketers who need a video immediately and don’t have any tools on hand. In any other case, it’s best to postpone video creation and start with a more decent tool. Canva makes much better videos than Google Ads’ built-in tools with almost the same effort. Google mostly creates basic slideshows, but Canva gives you thousands of professional templates, animations, and stock videos to use in your marketing. The simple drag-and-drop design lets you make engaging videos with smooth transitions and text effects that keep viewers engaged. Unlike Google’s static slideshows, Canva creates flowing video content that looks professionally made. If you spend just a few more minutes using Canva instead of Google’s tool, your videos will look much more professional and likely perform better with your audience. Alibaba’s Qwen is a strong competitor to Google Ads’ basic video tools, giving marketers better videos without needing special skills. While Google just makes simple slideshows, Qwen uses AI to turn your images and text into dynamic videos with smooth movements and professional transitions. The tool is great at automatically creating cohesive visual stories even from minimal input, adding motion to still images in ways that look professional. What stands out is how Qwen creates animations that actually match your product type and brand style, avoiding the one-size-fits-all look of Google’s templates. Though not as well-known as Canva in the West, Qwen’s AI approach produces polished videos that look intentionally designed rather than template-made, making it a great choice for marketers who want better videos than what Google offers. For the example of a dog food brand, Qwen delivered exceptional results. With the first prompt, Qwen created a five-second clip of golden retrievers playing around and going to a human hand to eat dog food from the hand. Not only did the video look pretty close to real life compared to the Qwen image generation “AI look,” but Qwen also did this as a free tool. No cost involved. If you compare this to the Google video creation, which is basically a PowerPoint presentation, Qwen makes a really good performance. Another great video tool is Sora from OpenAI. Since Sora is included in the $20 Premium membership, you can generate videos at almost no cost, though with some limitations on video quality and length. Still, there are a few tools out there that can generate decent AI video output for that cost. The Product Studio for Merchant Center Next is a beta image optimization tool within the Merchant Center, also accessible via the Google App within Shopify. It allows for creating product images in various scenes, as well as removing backgrounds and increasing image quality. These are two tries to display a gaming controller in a scene. Although the quality of the product image has remained reasonably good, the scenes are barely usable. The image processing prompt was “Showcase this controller in a living room, in front of a TV with neon lighting.” In practice, the desired scene was not even remotely depicted. The controller in front of notebooks or pens is out of place; the second attempt resulted in three black backgrounds and a fiery background. Unlike Google’s Product Studio, which struggles with accurate scene generation as shown in the gaming controller example, several free tools offer more reliable image optimization capabilities. Canva’s free tier includes a background removal tool that produces clean cutouts with remarkable accuracy. While scene creation is more limited in the free version, you can still place products on various pre-designed backgrounds or use their extensive template library to create more contextually appropriate product displays than what you experienced with Google’s tool. To remove backgrounds, use remove.bg, which is a specialized tool that focuses exclusively on background removal with impressive results, even for complex products like your gaming controller. The free version has size limitations but delivers professional-quality cutouts that can then be placed into scenes using other tools. For everything more complex, GIMP is a free and capable tool. This open-source image editor provides robust capabilities for both background removal and scene composition. Though it has a steeper learning curve, GIMP offers precise control over image quality enhancement and realistic product placement. Google’s native AI tools, while conveniently integrated into their advertising platform, consistently underperform compared to third-party alternatives. The evidence is clear and concerning. Google’s AI ad copy generator produced legally problematic content with brand infringement risks and hallucinated product details. Its image generation produced visually inaccurate representations. The video creation tool delivered little more than basic slideshows rather than engaging video content. Meanwhile, third-party solutions or Google’s own Gemini model used externally demonstrated superior capabilities across all creative functions: This performance gap reveals the fundamental tradeoff marketers face: convenience of integration vs. creative quality and performance. Google’s in-platform AI tools provide workflow efficiency but at the significant cost of creative limitations, brand safety concerns, and potential legal exposure. For marketers serious about campaign performance, the path forward is clear: Leverage external AI solutions for creative development, then import these higher-quality assets into Google’s advertising platform. This hybrid approach maintains the advantage of Google’s targeting and delivery mechanisms while avoiding the substantial limitations of their creative AI tools. As AI continues to evolve in marketing, successful advertisers will be those who strategically select the right tools for each specific function rather than defaulting to in-platform options for convenience alone. The evidence suggests that, for now, the marketing advantage lies decidedly with those willing to look beyond Google’s native AI for their creative development needs.

Title: Dow soars 1,100 points after Trump team and China dramatically lower tariffs | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: US stocks surged on Monday after President Donald Trump’s top trade officials brokered a surprisingly dramatic de-escalation in trade tensions with China over the weekend, dropping tariffs to much lower levels, which some economists say could stave off a US recession. The Dow closed higher by 1,161 points, or 2.81%. The broader S&P 500 gained 3.26%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite surged 4.35%. The three major indexes each posted their biggest single-day gains in over one month. “The sharp market rally today reflects the unexpectedly positive tariff news,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services, in a Monday note. “Many investors were not positioned for this outcome, leading to a significant market surge.” The Nasdaq, which had entered a bear market on April 4, closed up more than 20% from its lowest point this year — exiting its bear market and marking the start of a new bull market. (A rise of 20% from a recent low generally marks a bull market.) It’s been a swift recovery in recent weeks for the Nasdaq, though the index is still down about 3.1% this year. US stocks on Monday firmly erased all their losses since Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” trade announcement, which placed a 10% tariff on practically all goods coming into the United States and set significantly higher tariffs on dozens of countries. Trump paused most of those tariffs just days after they went into effect but jacked up import taxes on China — eventually to 145% on most Chinese imports. In turn, China hiked tariffs on US goods to 125%. The tit-for-tat trade war had effectively stopped trade between the two countries, risking substantial price hikes and shortages. Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both had said in recent weeks that tariffs on China had grown unsustainably high and a détente was necessary. But few believed that the result of the discussions between Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and their Chinese counterparts in Geneva this weekend was going to be quite so significant. Both sides agreed to axe tariffs by 115 percentage points, still leaving the levies considerably higher than where they were before Trump took office in January — but much, much lower than the historic level over the past month that deeply concerned American businesses, consumers, economists and investors. “No one had these low China tariff rates on their bingo cards,” said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, in an email. “This is a big positive surprise.” Another key element of the discussions: Bessent said the US and China had put in place a mechanism to avoid raising tariffs on each other again, suggesting that the worst of the trade war may be behind us. Trump said as much during a Monday press conference. When asked if the tariffs on Chinese exports would snap back to 145% if there were to be an impasse on trade talks, Trump said, “No.” “No, but they would go up substantially higher” than the 30% rate during the pause, he said. “I think you will have a deal, however.” The de-escalation of US-China tariffs further reduces global recession risks, Henry Allen, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to investors Monday morning. “The market’s resilience itself is making a recession less likely by easing financial conditions,” he wrote. “And policymakers don’t want a downturn or market turmoil either, as we saw with the 90-day extension to the reciprocal tariffs.” As a result, Wall Street cheered Monday morning. Investors showed greater appetite for riskier assets, including stocks. The US dollar rose 1.4% against a basket of currencies. US oil, which had tumbled as investors feared a demand vacuum because of a tariff-induced global recession, surged 1.52% to $61.95 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 1.64% to $64.96 a barrel. By contrast, investors sold off save-haven assets, such as gold, which tumbled 2.7%. US Treasuries also fell, sending the 10-year yield back above 4.45%. Bond prices and yields trade in opposite directions. Japan’s yen fell 2% against the dollar. The CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street’s fear gauge, sank more than 15% to its lowest level since the end of March. “Greed” was the sentiment driving markets, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed index. The index had been staunchly in “extreme fear” and “fear” this year before surging into “greed” this month. “The larger-than-expected drop in the tariffs between the US and China, while temporary, and the establishment of a framework for continued discussion, is exactly what the stock market was hoping to see,” said Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth. Tech stocks were particular winners on Monday: Despite a recent US carveout for hardware from tariffs on China, tech had been rocked in particular by the trade war between the US and China, because of the deeply intertwined relationship between American and Chinese technology sectors. Apple (AAPL) gained 6.3%, Tesla (TSLA) rose 6.75%, Nvidia (NVDA) was up 5.4%, Amazon (AMZN) rose 8.1% and Intel (INTC) was up 3.55%. Stocks of luxury goods makers, which had tumbled in recent months, bounced back sharply: Hermes rose 3.5%, Burberry was up 3.67% and LVMH surged 7%. Automakers also surged: Jeep and Chrysler maker Stellantis (STLA) was up 6.5%, General Motors (GM) rose 4.4% and Ford (F) was up 2.6%. “The risk-on move in markets suggests that investors had not expected such a positive outcome to come so quickly,” said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer for global equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a Monday note. “Investors will now be focused on signs that the temporary fix can be turned into a lasting agreement.” Bessent on Monday morning characterized the trade war de-escalation that he helped negotiate this weekend with his Chinese counterparts as tough but respectful. “We were firm, and we moved forward,” Bessent told CNBC from Geneva. “We tried to identify shared interest. We came with a list of problems that we were trying to solve, and I think we did a good job on that.” Bessent noted that America was negotiating from a position of strength because China needs the United States to buy its products more than the US relies on China for its goods exports. China’s economy is on the ropes, amid a housing crisis and an emerging debt crisis. Consumer spending has fallen, as has factory output. This is a bad time for China to be dealing with a crippling trade war. “I had seen what’s going on in the Chinese economy. We can see what’s going on with the shipments to the US,” Bessent said. “Again, we are the (trade) deficit country.Historically, the deficit is a country has a better negotiating position.” But, as the saying goes, no one wins in a trade war. US consumer sentiment fell off a cliff in recent months as inflation-weary Americans grew anxious about the prospect of rising prices and shortages. Shipments to the US from China were all but halted, rattling corporate America. And investors had braced for a recession, as economists said the US economy could get hit particularly hard by the trade war. The detente, though welcome by Wall Street, consumers and businesses, represents a remarkable shift for a Trump administration that only days ago had said the trade standoff with China was necessary to restore America’s lost manufacturing prowess. Trump had said last week that zero trade with China put America in a stronger position, because that meant it was no longer “losing money” to the Chinese. Bessent said the deal didn’t represent a major policy shift, however. “This is just a pause,” he said. “The April 2 tariff level for China was 34%, so we have moved that down from 34% to 10%.” Related article How Trump managed to get his much-needed China trade victory As the next step in negotiating, the US will focus on expanding its supply chains for what Bessent called “strategic necessities,” reducing its reliance on China for things like critical medicines, semiconductor chips and steel. “What we do want is a decoupling for strategic necessities, which we were unable to obtain during Covid,” he said. “And we realized that efficient supply chains were not resilient supply chains. So, we are going to create our own.” He also said the US would seek a fairer approach to international business. Bessent said the Trump administration wants to break down “insidious, non-tariff trade barriers that hurt American companies trying to do business” in other countries. The trade war de-escalation with China represents a big win for the US economy and the American consumer, Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council of the United States, told CNN’s Kate Bolduan Monday. Hassett said Trump had scored major concessions from China and the United Kingdom in their respective recent frameworks for trade negotiations, announced over the past few days, particularly by opening up the UK market to American beef and potentially paring back some of the barriers China had put in place on American companies looking to do business there. And Hassett suggested the agreement reached over the weekend should prevent further issues with supply shocks from China. “A lot of that is cleared up now — the potential for supply disruptions from China,” Hassett said. “I think it’s really a very historic fresh start in the relationship between the US and China.” But Hassett said the recent turn of events is not a contradiction in Trump’s prior policy. “The bottom line is what President Trump was saying was that if we don’t work out that good deal, we’ll be fine,” Hassett said. “The fact is that we didn’t sell practically anything to China.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: US stocks surged on Monday after President Donald Trump’s top trade officials brokered a surprisingly dramatic de-escalation in trade tensions with China over the weekend, dropping tariffs to much lower levels, which some economists say could stave off a US recession. The Dow closed higher by 1,161 points, or 2.81%. The broader S&P 500 gained 3.26%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite surged 4.35%. The three major indexes each posted their biggest single-day gains in over one month. “The sharp market rally today reflects the unexpectedly positive tariff news,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services, in a Monday note. “Many investors were not positioned for this outcome, leading to a significant market surge.” The Nasdaq, which had entered a bear market on April 4, closed up more than 20% from its lowest point this year — exiting its bear market and marking the start of a new bull market. (A rise of 20% from a recent low generally marks a bull market.) It’s been a swift recovery in recent weeks for the Nasdaq, though the index is still down about 3.1% this year. US stocks on Monday firmly erased all their losses since Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” trade announcement, which placed a 10% tariff on practically all goods coming into the United States and set significantly higher tariffs on dozens of countries. Trump paused most of those tariffs just days after they went into effect but jacked up import taxes on China — eventually to 145% on most Chinese imports. In turn, China hiked tariffs on US goods to 125%. The tit-for-tat trade war had effectively stopped trade between the two countries, risking substantial price hikes and shortages. Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both had said in recent weeks that tariffs on China had grown unsustainably high and a détente was necessary. But few believed that the result of the discussions between Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and their Chinese counterparts in Geneva this weekend was going to be quite so significant. Both sides agreed to axe tariffs by 115 percentage points, still leaving the levies considerably higher than where they were before Trump took office in January — but much, much lower than the historic level over the past month that deeply concerned American businesses, consumers, economists and investors. “No one had these low China tariff rates on their bingo cards,” said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, in an email. “This is a big positive surprise.” Another key element of the discussions: Bessent said the US and China had put in place a mechanism to avoid raising tariffs on each other again, suggesting that the worst of the trade war may be behind us. Trump said as much during a Monday press conference. When asked if the tariffs on Chinese exports would snap back to 145% if there were to be an impasse on trade talks, Trump said, “No.” “No, but they would go up substantially higher” than the 30% rate during the pause, he said. “I think you will have a deal, however.” The de-escalation of US-China tariffs further reduces global recession risks, Henry Allen, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to investors Monday morning. “The market’s resilience itself is making a recession less likely by easing financial conditions,” he wrote. “And policymakers don’t want a downturn or market turmoil either, as we saw with the 90-day extension to the reciprocal tariffs.” As a result, Wall Street cheered Monday morning. Investors showed greater appetite for riskier assets, including stocks. The US dollar rose 1.4% against a basket of currencies. US oil, which had tumbled as investors feared a demand vacuum because of a tariff-induced global recession, surged 1.52% to $61.95 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 1.64% to $64.96 a barrel. By contrast, investors sold off save-haven assets, such as gold, which tumbled 2.7%. US Treasuries also fell, sending the 10-year yield back above 4.45%. Bond prices and yields trade in opposite directions. Japan’s yen fell 2% against the dollar. The CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street’s fear gauge, sank more than 15% to its lowest level since the end of March. “Greed” was the sentiment driving markets, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed index. The index had been staunchly in “extreme fear” and “fear” this year before surging into “greed” this month. “The larger-than-expected drop in the tariffs between the US and China, while temporary, and the establishment of a framework for continued discussion, is exactly what the stock market was hoping to see,” said Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth.

Title: Gold Bars Rapidly Sell Out at Costco, Forcing Retail Giant To Slap New Purchase Restrictions on Customers: Report

A sudden rush in demand for gold is reportedly forcing retail giant Costco (COST) to put restrictions on how much customers can buy at a time. Costco’s 24-karat gold bars, which debuted in June of 2023, have seen historic demand amid all-time high prices and inflation concerns, reports Bloomberg. A survey from Bloomberg estimated that about 77% of Costco locations across the US that sell bullion bars were out of stock by the first week of October 2024, even after receiving fresh stocks in the previous weeks. Since then, the price of gold has gone much higher, currently trading at $3,248 after hitting an all-time high of $3,500. Now, Costco’s checkout page for its gold bars states, “Limit of one Transaction Per Membership, with a Maximum of two Units Per 24 Hours.” In April of last year, banking giant Wells Fargo estimated that Costco was seeing as much as $200 million per month in revenue from its gold bar sales alone. Said Wells Fargo equity analyst Edward Kelly at the time, “Our work suggests there has been significant interest given COST’s aggressive pricing and high level of customer trust… The accelerating frequency of Reddit posts, quick on-line sell-outs of product, and COST’s robust monthly eComm sales suggest a sharp uptick in momentum since the launch.” In addition to gold, Costco is also selling silver and platinum bars to its customers.

When asked if the tariffs on Chinese exports would snap back to 145% if there were to be an impasse on trade talks, Trump said, “No.” “No, but they would go up substantially higher” than the 30% rate during the pause, he said. “I think you will have a deal, however.” The de-escalation of US-China tariffs further reduces global recession risks, Henry Allen, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to investors Monday morning. “The market’s resilience itself is making a recession less likely by easing financial conditions,” he wrote. “And policymakers don’t want a downturn or market turmoil either, as we saw with the 90-day extension to the reciprocal tariffs.” As a result, Wall Street cheered Monday morning. Investors showed greater appetite for riskier assets, including stocks. The US dollar rose 1.4% against a basket of currencies. US oil, which had tumbled as investors feared a demand vacuum because of a tariff-induced global recession, surged 1.52% to $61.95 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 1.64% to $64.96 a barrel. By contrast, investors sold off save-haven assets, such as gold, which tumbled 2.7%. US Treasuries also fell, sending the 10-year yield back above 4.45%. Bond prices and yields trade in opposite directions. Japan’s yen fell 2% against the dollar. The CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street’s fear gauge, sank more than 15% to its lowest level since the end of March. “Greed” was the sentiment driving markets, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed index. The index had been staunchly in “extreme fear” and “fear” this year before surging into “greed” this month. “The larger-than-expected drop in the tariffs between the US and China, while temporary, and the establishment of a framework for continued discussion, is exactly what the stock market was hoping to see,” said Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth. Tech stocks were particular winners on Monday: Despite a recent US carveout for hardware from tariffs on China, tech had been rocked in particular by the trade war between the US and China, because of the deeply intertwined relationship between American and Chinese technology sectors. Apple (AAPL) gained 6.3%, Tesla (TSLA) rose 6.75%, Nvidia (NVDA) was up 5.4%, Amazon (AMZN) rose 8.1% and Intel (INTC) was up 3.55%. Stocks of luxury goods makers, which had tumbled in recent months, bounced back sharply: Hermes rose 3.5%, Burberry was up 3.67% and LVMH surged 7%. Automakers also surged: Jeep and Chrysler maker Stellantis (STLA) was up 6.5%, General Motors (GM) rose 4.4% and Ford (F) was up 2.6%. “The risk-on move in markets suggests that investors had not expected such a positive outcome to come so quickly,” said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer for global equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a Monday note. “Investors will now be focused on signs that the temporary fix can be turned into a lasting agreement.” Bessent on Monday morning characterized the trade war de-escalation that he helped negotiate this weekend with his Chinese counterparts as tough but respectful. “We were firm, and we moved forward,” Bessent told CNBC from Geneva. “We tried to identify shared interest. We came with a list of problems that we were trying to solve, and I think we did a good job on that.” Bessent noted that America was negotiating from a position of strength because China needs the United States to buy its products more than the US relies on China for its goods exports. China’s economy is on the ropes, amid a housing crisis and an emerging debt crisis. Consumer spending has fallen, as has factory output. This is a bad time for China to be dealing with a crippling trade war. “I had seen what’s going on in the Chinese economy. We can see what’s going on with the shipments to the US,” Bessent said. “Again, we are the (trade) deficit country.Historically, the deficit is a country has a better negotiating position.” But, as the saying goes, no one wins in a trade war. US consumer sentiment fell off a cliff in recent months as inflation-weary Americans grew anxious about the prospect of rising prices and shortages. Shipments to the US from China were all but halted, rattling corporate America. And investors had braced for a recession, as economists said the US economy could get hit particularly hard by the trade war. The detente, though welcome by Wall Street, consumers and businesses, represents a remarkable shift for a Trump administration that only days ago had said the trade standoff with China was necessary to restore America’s lost manufacturing prowess. Trump had said last week that zero trade with China put America in a stronger position, because that meant it was no longer “losing money” to the Chinese. Bessent said the deal didn’t represent a major policy shift, however. “This is just a pause,” he said. “The April 2 tariff level for China was 34%, so we have moved that down from 34% to 10%.” Related article How Trump managed to get his much-needed China trade victory As the next step in negotiating, the US will focus on expanding its supply chains for what Bessent called “strategic necessities,” reducing its reliance on China for things like critical medicines, semiconductor chips and steel. “What we do want is a decoupling for strategic necessities, which we were unable to obtain during Covid,” he said. “And we realized that efficient supply chains were not resilient supply chains. So, we are going to create our own.” He also said the US would seek a fairer approach to international business. Bessent said the Trump administration wants to break down “insidious, non-tariff trade barriers that hurt American companies trying to do business” in other countries. The trade war de-escalation with China represents a big win for the US economy and the American consumer, Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council of the United States, told CNN’s Kate Bolduan Monday. Hassett said Trump had scored major concessions from China and the United Kingdom in their respective recent frameworks for trade negotiations, announced over the past few days, particularly by opening up the UK market to American beef and potentially paring back some of the barriers China had put in place on American companies looking to do business there. And Hassett suggested the agreement reached over the weekend should prevent further issues with supply shocks from China. “A lot of that is cleared up now — the potential for supply disruptions from China,” Hassett said. “I think it’s really a very historic fresh start in the relationship between the US and China.” But Hassett said the recent turn of events is not a contradiction in Trump’s prior policy. “The bottom line is what President Trump was saying was that if we don’t work out that good deal, we’ll be fine,” Hassett said. “The fact is that we didn’t sell practically anything to China. We’re buying a lot of stuff from China. We could buy that stuff from other countries, or make it ourselves.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Media Buying Briefing: Buyers to weigh the flexibility of digital with the Upfront’s legacy scale

This Media Buying Briefing covers the latest in agency news and media buying for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Monday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → NewFronts week is done, and the video ad marketplace is about to hear from the veteran TV sellers of linear, cable and streaming — with YouTube pushing itself right into the middle of proceedings. Could 2025 be the year that ad dollars shift in greater volume from the linear broadcast and cable networks to the more investment-flexible, cost-efficient and consumer-friendly digital video environment showcased all last week? Several major publishers and the IAB last week presented their content wares and new ad units, while playing up brand safety as well. According to two of four media buyers Digiday spoke with, LinkedIn, of all Newfronts players, surprised the most with its presentation. First-time NewFronts presenter LinkedIn “went more tactile and opportunistic, and data- and AI-focused vs. ‘here’s our big, splashy new content program,’” said Angela Dahir, vp of strategy & media planning at Jellyfish. “It was more tactile functionality for us that we could then take to our clients who are in that B2B space, which we have a lot of … There’s a lot of unearthed opportunity in LinkedIn.” Another media buyer who spoke on condition of anonymity agreed that LinkedIn stood out, but even for reasons beyond B2B opportunities. “What was impressive about what they shared was just the narrative on how video on their platform is something that really impacts business decision makers,” said the buyer, who was also impressed by LinkedIn’s ability to offer data both on- and off-platform. “Business influencers, are really aiding in that, now that brands can kind of get involved with those business creators in a new way.” But it’s the more flexible investment opportunities that could sway some marketers and their media agencies to spend among NewFronts publishers rather than the classic TV providers — certainly at a time of great economic uncertainty (tariffs, interest rates, flagging consumer sentiment stats, unpredictable government policies, etc). “I think the benefits of cost efficiencies outweigh some of that upfront commitment and the pricing — the larger monetary commitment,” said Lindsey Freed, svp of media investment at Basis Technologies. “With more CTV streaming [and] programmatic buying, we’re seeing the rate efficiencies and the ability to target in very similar ways — it’s what the buzz is all about … The flexibility of being able to execute across that media, rather than committing a large dollar amount upfront is really where we’re going to see the shift.” “There’s a lot of evaluation going on of media spend,” said Tucker Matheson, CEO of Markacy, who said none of his clients are actually cutting budgets — yet. “Brands in a budget pinch are … really just trying to figure out where’s my biggest bang for my buck.” To Matheson, the answer lies in applying incrementality testing to guide them to the right investment. But there are also a number of new ad-unit opportunities being rolled out by some of the NewFronts presenters, as a means of attracting more ad dollars from brands of all size — some of which caught the eye of buyers. Some of the OEM providers like LG and Vizio showed off units including: “As media buyers, we’re really going to have to think about these new [habits], thinking of the consumer, what they’re doing, and tying our buys together to allow for that ease of shopping on our phone or shopping while we’re watching TV,” Basis Technologies’ Freed said. “CTV, for sure, offers a lot more of that potential to do more complex or interactive ad formats, whether it’s shoppable or just general formats than what you can do on linear,” said Chris Rigas, vp of media at Markacy. “There’s definitely an appeal to that. It’s obviously clear that CTV is going to continue gaining market share.” Of course, the linear companies also offer some of these innovations too, which can’t be forgotten — just like they offer the lion’s share of sports content. But again, the buyers Digiday spoke with said sports is clearly no longer the exclusive territory of the linear giants like NBC U or Disney. With Amazon, Tubi, Hulu and others now offering professional league sports content, it’s a more even playing field than ever. “This one has live sports and that one has live sports, and everyone’s getting connected through the pipeline,” said Jellyfish’s Dahir. “The digital marketplace is becoming now the crux of opportunity, because we have so much more access and more clients that are able to play in this video space that maybe we’re not able to in the past.” For better or worse, that diaspora of sports content raises its own set of problems for media buyers and planners. “If I’m watching [sports] on Peacock, but through my Chromecast, I get a different ad,” noted Dahir. “This creates a very fragmented landscape for live sports … I’m curious to see if there will eventually be a step backward. Because, yes, it gives us more opportunity of getting more efficient and effective buys in live sports, especially for smaller clients and that need for efficiency. But from a rating standpoint, I wonder if there will eventually be a pushback … because there’s too many touch points that you can tag it.” And that’s where programmatic steps in with both the offer of promise and potential for confusion. Much like three years ago, when CTV content became more available through programmatic investment, it ushered in the chance for smaller advertisers to get into TV advertising. But it also made a mess of not knowing who repped what inventory. That could happen with sports content today. Because the fact is, there’s a bottom-line shift that is taking place across the entire video landscape: the continued increase of programmatic investment vs. direct buying. “One theme that hit for me at the NewFronts was that personalized is premium and it’s more about the curation of content and context,” said the buyer on background. “It’s making sure that your ads are appearing within the content you wanted to appear with the audience targeting that you need. Programmatic makes that more easily possible and the workflow is way easier — when done right.” Added Basis Technologies’ Freed: “For buyers, it’s easier because we have more control — we are able to shift budgets between deal IDs easier than we can direct buys.” Amazon may be one the fastest growing powerhouses in major media, rivaling Google and Meta for supremacy — but it does have one problem. It seems more consumers are looking into how to cancel their Amazon Prime subscriptions than any other streamer, according to a study by Sparrow, which helps consumers get money from class-action suits. Here’s the data (although it must be noted, the below stats are of people searching for how to cancel, not actual cancellations): “It’s just changing the logo on the slide and saying, ‘I’m going to aggregate, and centralize all my media spend.’ And they’re going to lean heavier into principal media buying, and this allows them to make it easier for them to do that.” Microsoft is closing Xandr Invest, a sign that of its increased focus on AI and a harbinger of further ad tech consolidation. The Trade Desk’s Jeff Green discusses ad tech’s big issues. In this edition of the Digiday+ Research Briefing, we examine the impact of tariffs on consumers, retailers and advertisers.

PL Capital – Prabhudas Lilladher Group’s Alternative Investment Management company has launched its first Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) – the PL Capital Performing Credit Fund, a Category II AIF. Renisha Chainani, Head-Research at Augmont writes - After the Federal Reserve reaffirmed that it is not in a rush to cut interest rates since the U.S. economy is still relatively steady and inflation concerns are still high, gold’s price action last week was comparatively neutral. In recent weeks, the Greenback has recovered after dropping almost 9% from its March peak and momentarily falling below 98 last month. The US-China trade rhetoric has been cooling, which has been a major factor in the recovery. This weekend’s meeting between US and Chinese officials in Switzerland could have immediate effects. The United States and China declared “significant progress” following two days of negotiations in Switzerland to defuse a trade war. A trade deal with China was reached after two days of talks in Geneva, according to top Trump administration officials. This might be a huge win for President Donald Trump in his trade war with Beijing. Trump indicated a readiness to reduce U.S. tariffs on China to 80% going into the weekend trade talks, but it was unclear at first if either side would agree to decrease taxes on the other. Trade discussions with US officials are “an important first step” in stabilising bilateral trade relations, according to China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng. The two parties also achieved “substantial progress,” according to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. However, traders will watch the contents of the US-China trade discussions, which the US will provide on Monday. In April, the People’s Bank of China increased its gold stockpiles by 2 tonnes for the sixth consecutive month, according to the World Gold Council. While the Czech National Bank’s reserves rose by 2.5 tonnes in April, the National Bank of Poland’s (NBP) holdings jumped by 12 tonnes to 509 tonnes. The sellers would be able to regain control, at least temporarily, if tensions were to decrease or some tariffs were to be lowered. Additionally, the fact that gains have now paused twice in the mid-$3400 (~Rs 97000) range suggests that the rally may be nearing its short-term exhaustion. Gold prices may drop to $3200 (~Rs 92000) if they remain below $3365 (~Rs 94000) this week. And we are expected to see a $200 decline from those levels up to $3000 (~Rs 86000) if prices break and hold below $3200, which is the Double Top formation’s neckline support. Credifin Limited (earlier PHF Leasing Limited), a Metropolitan Stock Exchange of India listed, NBFC, headquartered in Jalandhar with its Corporate Office in Delhi-NCR, announced the launch of its new product: EV Startup Loans.

We prefer Data Patterns, BEL, Mazagon Dock, Garden Reach Shipbuilders, Zen Tech, Paras Defence and HAL. ➡️ Opportunity in Adversity: In the on-going India vs. Pakistan Conflict, India has been showcasing its defence capabilities by standing strong against Chinese systems used by Pakistan. We believe that this demonstration will open gates in terms of export opportunities for India ➡️ Operation Sindoor delivered a resounding blow to the credibility of Pakistan’s Chinese-supplied air defence systems and, by extension, to Beijing’s claims of military superiority. ➡️Few of the indigenously-developed systems used in the ongoing conflict include: Akash: The Akash Missile System is fully integrated into defensive posture. Developed by the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO), the Akash system plays a central role in India’s self-reliant defence strategy under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative. Developed by Bharat Electronics, Akashteer proved to be a game-changer for India and enhances air defence through automation, real-time sensor integration, and decentralized engagement authority. INS Vikrant: India’s first indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant constructed by Cochin Shipyard. ➡️ India didn’t just destroy terror camps. It dismantled myths—about Chinese power, Pakistani defence, and who holds the technological edge in South Asia. ➡️ Further, in yesterday’s conference, Defence Minister Mr. Rajnath Singh, reaffirmed his ambitious target of achieving the export target of Rs500bn (from current Rs240bn) in FY29 and becoming the largest defence exporter by 2047. Few of the other recent activities in the sector include: ➡️ India and France recently sign Rs630bn deal for 26 Rafale fighters. Under offset obligations, components and equipment for the aircraft will be manufactured domestically in India with request to integrate indigenous weapons systems, including the Astra beyond-visual-range missiles and Rudram anti-radiation missiles, into the Rafale-M platform, providing a significant opportunity for the domestic companies. ➡️ Amidst ongoing crises within the Middle East, Russia’s war in Ukraine and rising geopolitical tensions due to great power competition, countries around the world are funneling more funds towards defence spending in 2024 as they implemented new spending pledges and large-scale procurement plans, according to SIPRI report. ➡️ NATO’s accelerated EURO800bn defence spend over the next 3-4 years, triggered by reduced US support under Trump-era policies, creates a significant export opportunity for Indian defence firms—especially private players, which account for 60–65% of exports. ➡️ Coalition government in Pakistan has endorsed an 18% increase in defence spending to over Rs2.5trn in the next budget due to heightened tensions with India. View: We maintain a positive outlook on the Defence sector owing to the ongoing geopolitical tensions, significant growth potential, increased defence budgets and increased investments in advanced technologies such as AI and robotics. We truly believe that 2025 is a “Year of Reforms” for the defence sector as India has proved its growing prowess in next-generation stand-off warfare—blending stealth, precision, and psychological supremacy. We believe that the private defence companies are set to benefit from the potential export opportunities while the PSUs will benefit from the domestic demands. We maintain our long-term positive view on Data Patterns, Bharat Electronics, Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, Garden Reach Shipbuilders, Zen Technologies, Paras Defence and Technology and Hindustan Aeronautics.
