Shares of the local arm of South Korea's LG Electronics were allotted at the upper end of the ₹1,080 to ₹1,140 price band, an exchange filing showed late on Monday. The initial public offering comes during the second-busiest quarter on record for Indian listings, with firms set to raise up to $8 billion. LG Electronics India had planned for a listing by May after filing for an IPO last December, but delayed the share sale citing market volatility. Blackrock invested 971.6 million rupees, Singapore's wealth fund 1.71 billion rupees and Norway's wealth fund 1.05 billion rupees. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority was allotted shares worth 1.02 billion rupees. Domestic mutual funds were allotted about 49% of the shares set aside for anchor investors, with SBI and HDFC funds among the biggest buyers. Together, anchor investors will buy about 30% of the 101.8 million shares on offer at the IPO. Anchor investors are large institutional investors, such as mutual funds, insurance companies and pension funds, who are allotted shares before the subscription opens for retail and other investors. These investors are subject to a mandatory lock-in period after listing, in which they cannot sell their shares. LG Electronics India's three-day share sale opens for other investors on October 7. The firm is India's second largest appliance maker and competes with Whirlpool and Samsung , in the domestic market. Its parent firm is looking to make India its global manufacturing hub, for its competitive labour costs and strong domestic demand, an executive told Reuters last week.

Title: How The Trade Desk faces growing challenges amid rising competition

Time Published: 2025-10-07T04:01:00Z

Join us Oct. 15-17 in Phoenix to connect with top media buyers Subscribe: Apple Podcasts • Spotify Ad tech isn’t an easy business. Just ask The Trade Desk. Once the crown jewel of the industry, The Trade Desk is presently having a rough go. Between missed revenue targets and rising competition from the likes of Amazon, cracks are starting to form in the company’s crown. For years, The Trade Desk was the premier platform, raking in enough spend to account for 33 consecutive quarters of meeting or beating expectations. Slowly, things started to change. Disgruntled media agency whispers around fees reached a fever pitch. Kokai, its AI-driven data platform upgrade, lost hype. Walmart split, ending the exclusive part of its partnership with The Trade Desk. Meanwhile, it seems Google and Amazon are looking to fill in any gaps The Trade Desk may leave open. “There was never any doubt that Amazon and Google were going to make a play for that part of the market with their DSPs,” said Seb Joseph, Digiday executive editor of news, on a recent episode of the Digiday Podcast. “It was just a question of when.” In this episode of the Digiday Podcast, Joseph and senior reporter of advertising technology Ronan Shields, join co-hosts Kimeko McCoy and Tim Peterson, to discuss the rise of The Trade Desk and the likelihood it’ll continue to hold its own in a changing DSP landscape. Also in this episode, OpenAI and Meta continue to fuel the AI arms race with AI-generated videos in TikTok-style feeds and Meta ups the ante by using chatbot data to target ads. Then, Paramount acquired Bari Weiss’ The Free Press and brought Weiss on as editor-in-chief of CBS News. Here are a few highlights from the conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity. The Trade Desk’s tough year Peterson: There were bubbling concerns of “is The Trade Desk the next too big player in the ad tech space?” This year, the Trade Desk is still pretty dominant, but that dominance has definitely been put in check by… not even the rise of Amazon’s DSP, but Amazon’s DSP seems to have shifted into a new gear this year… As we’re recording this, Amazon announced a partnership with Spotify to have Spotify’s video and audio inventory available for sale through the Amazon DSP. Meanwhile, The Trade Desk has just had a tough year. Joseph: The Trade Desk has definitely had a rough time of it, probably going as far back as 18 months. You could feel that pressure building last spring when Amazon rolled out ads on Prime Video. As we reported, that move alone threw a spotlight on the Amazon ad business. By contrast, it pushed The Trade Desk into a more vulnerable position. But the real shift came when The Trade Desk missed its Q4 2024 numbers. Increased competition Shields: [Walmart] was one of the big temple narratives they had as a big player. It’s that pinstripe movement that they appeared to be in because the growth of the Amazon DSP is coming forward. That was probably more of a blow to its stock price. Losing Walmart, it’s not going to bolster the confidence of the market, sadly. That’s for sure. Much of this decline in its market value is due to the emergence of the Amazon DSP. There’s a saying out there, “If Amazon is getting into your business, it’s time to get out of your business.” That’s a cautionary tale. Acquire or be acquired? Joseph: I don’t think you can rule it [The Trade Desk being acquired by the likes of OpenAI] out. OpenAI generated $4.3 billion in revenue, but burned through $2.5 billion in the first half of the year. The need to spin up an ads business gets more intense by the quarter. Going on the M&A trail is the way to do that. Despite the issues with The Trade Desk, it’s still a robust business. Wu joined the Digiday Podcast for the latest installment of the show’s “Day in the Life” series, in which members of the media and marketing industries share their systems and tips for getting through the average work day. The news publisher’s chief AI officer detailed his new position and how the Post is using AI to power its subscription paywall in a Digiday Podcast live recording during the Digiday Publishing Summit. The brand exec shared how Ferrero is rethinking retail media as a full-funnel tool — but challenges remain — at the Retail Media Advertising Strategies event in New York City.

Title: Little Movement Predicted For Malaysia Shares

Time Published: 2025-10-07T03:36:26Z

The Malaysia stock market on Friday snapped the five-day winning streak in which it had rallied more than 35 points or 2.2 percent. The Kuala Lumpur Composite Index now sits just above the 1,635-point plateau and it figures to remain in that neighborhood again on Monday. The global forecast for the Asian markets is murky as the U.S. government shutdown continues. The European and U.S. markets were mixed and little changed and the Asian bourses are expected to open in similar fashion. The KLCI finished slightly lower on Friday following losses from the telecoms and mixed performances from the financial shares and property stocks. For the day, the index slipped 2.74 points or 0.17 percent to finish at 1,635.06 after trading between 1,631.43 and 1,658.73. Among the actives, 99 Speed Mart Retail rallied 1.39 percent, while AMMB Holdings sank 0.68 percent, Celcomdigi lost 0.54 percent, CIMB Group climbed 1.05 percent, Gamuda dipped 0.18 percent, IHH Healthcare tanked 1.57 percent, IOI Corporation gathered 0.25 percent, Kuala Lumpur Kepong stumbled 1.66 percent, Maxis rose 0.27 percent, Maybank and PPB Group both perked 0.20 percent, MISC added 0.54 percent, MRDIY jumped 1.20 percent, Nestle Malaysia and Hong Leong Bank both eased 0.10 percent, Petronas Chemicals advanced 0.94 percent, Petronas Dagangan increased 0.78 percent, Petronas Gas gained 0.43 percent, Press Metal shed 0.67 percent, Public Bank dropped 0.69 percent, QL Resources improved 0.92 percent, Sunway fell 0.34 percent, Telekom Malaysia slumped 0.70 percent, Tenaga Nasional tumbled 1.34 percent and YTL Corporation, YTL Power, RHB Bank, Sime Darby, SD Guthrie and Axiata were unchanged. The lead from Wall Street offers little clarity as the major averages opened higher on Friday but went off in different directions to finish mixed. The Dow jumped 238.58 points or 0.51 percent to finish at a record 46,758.28, while the NASDAQ sank 63.59 points or 0.28 percent to end at 22,780.51 and the S&P 500 perked 0.44 points or 0.01 percent to close at 6,715.79, also a record. For the week, the NASDAQ rallied 1.3 percent, while the Dow and the S&P both rose 1.1 percent. The NASDAQ sank on weakness from technology shares such as Palantir (PLTR), Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA). The lackluster performance by the broader markets came as the ongoing U.S. government shutdown has led to the indefinite delay of key U.S. economic data, including Friday's closely watched monthly jobs report. However, weak data from non-government sources has increased confidence that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting interest rates in the coming months. Crude oil prices advanced on Friday amid U.S. dollar weakness as the government shutdown persisted. West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery was up $0.41 or 0.68 percent at $60.89 per barrel. For comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com October 03, 2025 16:10 ET First half of this week the focus was on efforts to avoid a government shutdown in the U.S. However, talks to avert one failed and an almost total blackout of federal government began on October 1, Wednesday. The weekly claims data due on Thursday and the job report on Friday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics were not released. In Europe, inflation data in the euro area raised concern and the latest interest rate decision from India was among the main news in Asia.

Title: Asia Morning Briefing: Regional Crypto Power Balance Is Shifting as Japan 'Ready to Pop’
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/07/asia-morning-briefing-regional-crypto-power-balance-is-shifting-as-japan-ready-to-pop
Time Published: 2025-10-07T01:43:37Z
Full Content:
Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. The conventional wisdom holds that the battle for Asia's crypto hub is a contest between Singapore and Hong Kong. Both cities have English as an official language and use Western-inspired common law in their court system. But during Token2049, executives weren't debating whether Singapore or Hong Kong would win the title of Asia’s crypto hub. Instead, they were talking about how Japan, once written off as overregulated, had quietly become the region’s most credible market for real trading volume, staking infrastructure, and institutional growth. “Japan had no regulation for a long time, don't forget, that's where crypto basically happened, and then it went super stringent, and nothing happened for a long time," Konstantin Richter, the CEO of Blockdaemon, told CoinDesk during Token2049. "But people kept on chiming away, and now they actually have a regulatory infrastructure that’s institutionally scalable and about ready to pop. Whereas here [in Singapore], it was a free fall, and now they're starting to build up regulation.” Singapore moved fast and then tightened. It opened its doors early to crypto firms, building a reputation as Asia’s sandbox for innovation. That worked, until it didn’t. The collapse of FTX and other failures exposed weak consumer protections, prompting the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to swing toward heavy supervision in 2024. The result: higher compliance costs, mandatory custody segregation, external audits, and slower licensing. Those that don't like it have to leave, even if they aren't serving Singapore-based customers. It's a lot of work for a relatively small market. “Singapore was so crypto-friendly that everyone wanted to come here,” Richter said. “Then it built up, things happened, and suddenly you’re like, wait a minute, we do need more stringent rules.” Japan, by contrast, did its hard regulatory work years ago. Following Mt. Gox (2014) and Coincheck (2018), Japanese regulators had already imposed strict licensing, segregation, and onshore custody rules long before FTX imploded. By 2025, instead of tightening, Japan is opening slightly: allowing institutional staking, setting a pathway for crypto-backed ETFs, and clarifying how firms can offer yield. Unlike Singapore’s innovation-first, regulate-later approach, Japan’s regulators wrote detailed rules for custody, segregation, and security years ago. Exchanges must hold client assets separately and use domestic validators, creating the kind of environment institutional investors prefer. Richter said Asian clients, particularly in Japan, are willing to pay for institutional-grade infrastructure, a contrast, he noted, to Europe, where customers are typically more price-driven. The shift isn’t just regulatory. Japan's almost invisible yield – the Bank of Japan only ended negative rates last year – makes staking unusually attractive: a 3 % ETH yield is 30 times higher than domestic treasury returns. That’s why Blockdaemon and other node operators see Tokyo as the next major destination for institutional staking flows. Derivatives exchange BitMEX is also taking notice. In a recent interview with CoinDesk, BitMEX CEO Stephan Lutz said the exchange had just moved its data center to Amazon Web Services' facility in Tokyo to be closer to where the action is. Japan’s crypto framework, once criticized for being too strict, now gives it a clear edge: predictable oversight, investor protection, and rising institutional yield. Now, the question is, how will the usual hubs of Hong Kong and Singapore compete? BTC: Bitcoin surged past $126,000 in a “perfect storm” of macro tailwinds. Yet this latest breakout above $125,000 came largely from non-institutional demand. With ETF inflows paused and retail traders fueling momentum through high perpetual funding rates, BTC’s resilience above prior highs suggests whales are holding steady and scarcity narratives are deepening. ETH: Ethereum traded around $4,705, extending its recent strength on renewed interest in on-chain fundamentals, upgrade optimism, and rotation from BTC to altcoins, as BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) added 179,251 ETH last week, bringing its holdings to 2.83 million tokens worth $13.4 billion, in a bid to control 5% of Ethereum’s supply and solidify its position as the second-largest listed crypto treasury after Strategy. Gold: Gold traded around $3,960, nearing Bank of America’s long-held $4,000 target, but the bank’s analysts now warn the metal looks overbought and could face a Q4 consolidation after a 50% yearly rally, even as longer-term charts still leave room for gains toward $5,000–$7,000 if the bull cycle continues. Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 hit another record high Tuesday, boosted by a Wall Street tech rally and strong chip stocks following the OpenAI-AMD deal, extending gains after Sanae Takaichi’s election as Japan’s next prime minister, which fueled optimism over pro-growth policies.

Think360.ai, a full-stack data science and AI solutions company and part of the CAMS Group, today announced the launch of ConsenPro, an advanced platform that enables enterprises to seamlessly comply with India’s new Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act “Gold prices have risen to record highs near $4,000 an ounce as haven demand was reinforced with growing political uncertainty in the France, US, Japan to name a few. The wave of political uncertainty in the developed world kept investors largely pinned towards gold. Persistent bets on more interest rate cuts by the U.S. FED also benefited metal markets. Rate cuts are contingent on the path of inflation and the labor market. Increased gold buying by China has also been supporting the bullion prices. China is diversifying its foreign reserves from the dollar and U.S. Treasuries to Gold. Akin to these buying is the strong Gold ETF inflows. The safe haven demand for gold ramped up, especially as a U.S. government shutdown’s political deadlock doesn’t seem to end soon. It has stretched into the eighth day. Gold is not a short-term trade or a technical breakout story. Its factual about gold not being under any default and it’s a form of capital requiring no counterparty credibility to maintain value. Gold is the ultimate hedge against runaway debt. The world debt scenario is leading to the gold story. When the world runs on debt, gold becomes the final line of defense. The global debt-to-GDP ratio stands above 324%. Global debt climbing to a record-breaking height of $337.70 trillion. It’s this that’s driving gold and not inflation per se. Debt is climbing faster than output and gold has become the stabilizer. As regards the US angle, once the dollar was unpegged from gold, governments began to spend with abandon, instead of cutting spending or raising taxes. The deficits kept running and financed by the Federal Reserve. US government debt now stands at a jaw-dropping $37.5 trillion, equal to roughly 124% of GDP.” Tailwinds for a case of Gold $4000 - $5000 •\u0009Accelerating massive debt pile in U.S, fiscal imbalances widening with constrained monetary policy. •\u0009FED can’t raise rates without bankrupting the government. It can’t make deep cuts without tanking the dollar. •\u0009US interest rate cut expectations and weakening of USD • Central banks continue to buy physical bullion (Year 2022 – 1080 tons, Year 2023 – 1051 tons, Year 2024 – 1089 tons, H1 2025 – 415 tons). •\u0009Net inflows of gold ETF on record (H1 2025 Year 397 tons), robust retail demand from India & China. •\u0009Deteriorating geopolitical situation (especially in Ukraine and Gaza) helping to create strong demand for gold. •\u0009Financial conditions showed US Treasury yields to be the key variable influencing gold, rather than the U.S. dollar. Satin Finserv Limited (SFL), the MSME-focused arm of Satin Creditcare Network Limited (SCNL), has successfully raised INR 60 crores through the issuance of listed, secured, and rated Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) in two tranches of INR 30 crores each. The funds have been raised from reputed institutional investors at a competitive coupon rate of 10.95% p.a., underscoring investor confidence in SFL’s strong fundamentals and growth outlook. The NCDs have been assigned a long-term rating of A- (Stable) by ICRA, further reflecting the entity’s strong credit profile and sustainable growth prospects. The Company is well capitalized with a CRAR of 36.83% and debt to equity ratio of 2.46 times as on Jun’25. The proceeds will be strategically deployed towards expanding the company’s core MSME lending operations along with its recently introduced Green Finance initiative. With larger expansion plans underway, such fundraises will provide the necessary momentum for SFL to consolidate its presence in the financial inclusion space and build scalable, impact-driven lending models. This issuance also reaffirms SFL’s ability to access diverse pools of funds at competitive rates, strengthening its financial position as it scales up operations. Juniper Green Energy Limited (“Juniper Green Energy”) today announced that its subsidiary Juniper Green Sigma Eight Private Limited (“Juniper Sigma”) has signed a Power Purchase Agreement with TATA Power Company Limited for a capacity of 70 MW Firm and Dispatchable Renewable Energy (FDRE) power project.

Shares traded at Rs 216.84 on the NSE, down 3%. “Gold prices have risen to record highs near $4,000 an ounce as haven demand was reinforced with growing political uncertainty in the France, US, Japan to name a few. The wave of political uncertainty in the developed world kept investors largely pinned towards gold. Persistent bets on more interest rate cuts by the U.S. FED also benefited metal markets. Rate cuts are contingent on the path of inflation and the labor market. Increased gold buying by China has also been supporting the bullion prices. China is diversifying its foreign reserves from the dollar and U.S. Treasuries to Gold. Akin to these buying is the strong Gold ETF inflows. The safe haven demand for gold ramped up, especially as a U.S. government shutdown’s political deadlock doesn’t seem to end soon. It has stretched into the eighth day. Gold is not a short-term trade or a technical breakout story. Its factual about gold not being under any default and it’s a form of capital requiring no counterparty credibility to maintain value. Gold is the ultimate hedge against runaway debt. The world debt scenario is leading to the gold story. When the world runs on debt, gold becomes the final line of defense. The global debt-to-GDP ratio stands above 324%. Global debt climbing to a record-breaking height of $337.70 trillion. It’s this that’s driving gold and not inflation per se. Debt is climbing faster than output and gold has become the stabilizer. As regards the US angle, once the dollar was unpegged from gold, governments began to spend with abandon, instead of cutting spending or raising taxes. The deficits kept running and financed by the Federal Reserve. US government debt now stands at a jaw-dropping $37.5 trillion, equal to roughly 124% of GDP.” Tailwinds for a case of Gold $4000 - $5000 •\u0009Accelerating massive debt pile in U.S, fiscal imbalances widening with constrained monetary policy. •\u0009FED can’t raise rates without bankrupting the government. It can’t make deep cuts without tanking the dollar. •\u0009US interest rate cut expectations and weakening of USD • Central banks continue to buy physical bullion (Year 2022 – 1080 tons, Year 2023 – 1051 tons, Year 2024 – 1089 tons, H1 2025 – 415 tons). •\u0009Net inflows of gold ETF on record (H1 2025 Year 397 tons), robust retail demand from India & China. •\u0009Deteriorating geopolitical situation (especially in Ukraine and Gaza) helping to create strong demand for gold. •\u0009Financial conditions showed US Treasury yields to be the key variable influencing gold, rather than the U.S. dollar.

The political upheavals in Japan and France are escalating fiscal worries and fuelling the gold rally. · After unsuccessful attempts to come to an agreement with political parties about budget spending, which prevented efforts to control the biggest fiscal deficit in the euro area, Sebastien Lecornu resigned as the prime minister of France.

The wave of political uncertainty in the developed world kept investors largely pinned towards gold. Persistent bets on more interest rate cuts by the U.S. FED also benefited metal markets.

China is diversifying its foreign reserves from the dollar and U.S. Treasuries to Gold. Akin to these buying is the strong Gold ETF inflows. The safe haven demand for gold ramped up, especially as a U.S. government shutdown’s political deadlock doesn’t seem to end soon. It has stretched into the eighth day. Gold is not a short-term trade or a technical breakout story. Its factual about gold not being under any default and it’s a form of capital requiring no counterparty credibility to maintain value.

As regards the US angle, once the dollar was unpegged from gold, governments began to spend with abandon, instead of cutting spending or raising taxes.

Posted on 10/06/2025 5:36:18 PM PDT by marcusmaximus Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Cognizant and eight other major corporations have been questioned by U.S. Senators for filing thousands of H-1B skilled labour visa petitions after conducting "mass layoffs" of American employees. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley and ranking member Richard Durbin have also questioned Amazon, Apple, Deloitte, Google, JPMorgan Chase, Meta, Microsoft, and Walmart, asking them for details on their hiring and recruitment practices as well as any variation in salary and benefits between H-1B visa holders and American employees. The Senators said their "inquiry" comes at a time when the unemployment rate in America’s tech sector is "well above" the overall jobless rate. According to the Federal Reserve, recent American graduates with STEM degrees now face higher unemployment rates than the general population, they stated. -snip- "In evaluating the high unemployment rate for American tech workers, we cannot ignore the massive, ongoing layoffs ordered by you and your peers in Big Tech C-suites over the past few years...At the same time you have been laying off your employees, you have been filing H-1B visa petitions for (thousands of) foreign workers,” the Senators wrote in letters to 10 major employers in the U.S. on September 25, 2025. They added: "With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that (you) cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions."

Lee and Harris Introduce Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act February 7, 2019 WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Kamala Harris (D-CA) introduced the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act Wednesday, a bill that would remove per-country caps for employment-based green cards. “Immigrants should not be penalized due to their country of origin,” Sen. Lee said. “Treating people fairly and equally is part of our founding creed and the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act reflects that belief. Immigration is often a contentious issue, but we should not delay progress in areas where there is bipartisan consensus just because we have differences in a other areas.” “Ours is a nation of immigrants, and our strength has always come from our diversity and our unity,” Sen. Harris said. “We must do more to eliminate discriminatory backlogs and facilitate family unity so that high-skilled immigrants are not vulnerable to exploitation and can stay in the U.S. and continue to contribute to the economy. I’m proud to join with Senator Lee on this bipartisan legislation to ensure that our country remains vibrant and dynamic.” The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act also increases the per-country caps for family-sponsored green cards from 7 percent to 15 percent. Without adding any new green cards, S. 386 creates a “first-come, first-served” system that alleviates the backlogs and allows green cards to be awarded more efficiently. The bill has broad bipartisan support and is additionally cosponsored by Sens. Roy Blunt (R-MO), Susan Collins (R-ME), Jim Moran (R-KS), Tom Carper (D-DE), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Maria Cantwell D-WA), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Krysten Sinema (D-AZ). The bill has also been endorsed by Immigration Voice, Compete America Coalition, the Information Technology Industry Council, Google, Microsoft, The Heritage Foundation, La Raza, and many others. https://www.lee.senate.gov/2019/2/sens-lee-and-harris-introduce-fairness-for-high-skilled-immigrants-act 17 posted on 10/06/2025 6:55:09 PM PDT by marcusmaximus [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 15 | View Replies] To: marcusmaximus Add Cisco, Adobe, Fidelity to that list.

Lee and Harris Introduce Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act February 7, 2019 WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Kamala Harris (D-CA) introduced the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act Wednesday, a bill that would remove per-country caps for employment-based green cards. “Immigrants should not be penalized due to their country of origin,” Sen. Lee said. “Treating people fairly and equally is part of our founding creed and the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act reflects that belief. Immigration is often a contentious issue, but we should not delay progress in areas where there is bipartisan consensus just because we have differences in a other areas.” “Ours is a nation of immigrants, and our strength has always come from our diversity and our unity,” Sen. Harris said. “We must do more to eliminate discriminatory backlogs and facilitate family unity so that high-skilled immigrants are not vulnerable to exploitation and can stay in the U.S. and continue to contribute to the economy. I’m proud to join with Senator Lee on this bipartisan legislation to ensure that our country remains vibrant and dynamic.” The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act also increases the per-country caps for family-sponsored green cards from 7 percent to 15 percent. Without adding any new green cards, S. 386 creates a “first-come, first-served” system that alleviates the backlogs and allows green cards to be awarded more efficiently. The bill has broad bipartisan support and is additionally cosponsored by Sens. Roy Blunt (R-MO), Susan Collins (R-ME), Jim Moran (R-KS), Tom Carper (D-DE), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Maria Cantwell D-WA), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Krysten Sinema (D-AZ). The bill has also been endorsed by Immigration Voice, Compete America Coalition, the Information Technology Industry Council, Google, Microsoft, The Heritage Foundation, La Raza, and many others. https://www.lee.senate.gov/2019/2/sens-lee-and-harris-introduce-fairness-for-high-skilled-immigrants-act 17 posted on 10/06/2025 6:55:09 PM PDT by marcusmaximus [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 15 | View Replies] To: marcusmaximus Add Cisco, Adobe, Fidelity to that list.

Lee and Harris Introduce Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act February 7, 2019 WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Kamala Harris (D-CA) introduced the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act Wednesday, a bill that would remove per-country caps for employment-based green cards. “Immigrants should not be penalized due to their country of origin,” Sen. Lee said. “Treating people fairly and equally is part of our founding creed and the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act reflects that belief. Immigration is often a contentious issue, but we should not delay progress in areas where there is bipartisan consensus just because we have differences in a other areas.” “Ours is a nation of immigrants, and our strength has always come from our diversity and our unity,” Sen. Harris said. “We must do more to eliminate discriminatory backlogs and facilitate family unity so that high-skilled immigrants are not vulnerable to exploitation and can stay in the U.S. and continue to contribute to the economy. I’m proud to join with Senator Lee on this bipartisan legislation to ensure that our country remains vibrant and dynamic.” The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act also increases the per-country caps for family-sponsored green cards from 7 percent to 15 percent. Without adding any new green cards, S. 386 creates a “first-come, first-served” system that alleviates the backlogs and allows green cards to be awarded more efficiently. The bill has broad bipartisan support and is additionally cosponsored by Sens. Roy Blunt (R-MO), Susan Collins (R-ME), Jim Moran (R-KS), Tom Carper (D-DE), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Maria Cantwell D-WA), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Krysten Sinema (D-AZ). The bill has also been endorsed by Immigration Voice, Compete America Coalition, the Information Technology Industry Council, Google, Microsoft, The Heritage Foundation, La Raza, and many others. https://www.lee.senate.gov/2019/2/sens-lee-and-harris-introduce-fairness-for-high-skilled-immigrants-act Add Cisco, Adobe, Fidelity to that list.

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/06/2025 5:36:18 PM PDT by marcusmaximus Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Cognizant and eight other major corporations have been questioned by U.S. Senators for filing thousands of H-1B skilled labour visa petitions after conducting "mass layoffs" of American employees. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley and ranking member Richard Durbin have also questioned Amazon, Apple, Deloitte, Google, JPMorgan Chase, Meta, Microsoft, and Walmart, asking them for details on their hiring and recruitment practices as well as any variation in salary and benefits between H-1B visa holders and American employees. The Senators said their "inquiry" comes at a time when the unemployment rate in America’s tech sector is "well above" the overall jobless rate. According to the Federal Reserve, recent American graduates with STEM degrees now face higher unemployment rates than the general population, they stated. -snip- "In evaluating the high unemployment rate for American tech workers, we cannot ignore the massive, ongoing layoffs ordered by you and your peers in Big Tech C-suites over the past few years...At the same time you have been laying off your employees, you have been filing H-1B visa petitions for (thousands of) foreign workers,” the Senators wrote in letters to 10 major employers in the U.S. on September 25, 2025. They added: "With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that (you) cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions."

Lee and Harris Introduce Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act February 7, 2019 WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Kamala Harris (D-CA) introduced the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act Wednesday, a bill that would remove per-country caps for employment-based green cards. “Immigrants should not be penalized due to their country of origin,” Sen. Lee said. “Treating people fairly and equally is part of our founding creed and the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act reflects that belief. Immigration is often a contentious issue, but we should not delay progress in areas where there is bipartisan consensus just because we have differences in a other areas.” “Ours is a nation of immigrants, and our strength has always come from our diversity and our unity,” Sen. Harris said. “We must do more to eliminate discriminatory backlogs and facilitate family unity so that high-skilled immigrants are not vulnerable to exploitation and can stay in the U.S. and continue to contribute to the economy. I’m proud to join with Senator Lee on this bipartisan legislation to ensure that our country remains vibrant and dynamic.” The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act also increases the per-country caps for family-sponsored green cards from 7 percent to 15 percent. Without adding any new green cards, S. 386 creates a “first-come, first-served” system that alleviates the backlogs and allows green cards to be awarded more efficiently. The bill has broad bipartisan support and is additionally cosponsored by Sens. Roy Blunt (R-MO), Susan Collins (R-ME), Jim Moran (R-KS), Tom Carper (D-DE), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Maria Cantwell D-WA), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Krysten Sinema (D-AZ). The bill has also been endorsed by Immigration Voice, Compete America Coalition, the Information Technology Industry Council, Google, Microsoft, The Heritage Foundation, La Raza, and many others. https://www.lee.senate.gov/2019/2/sens-lee-and-harris-introduce-fairness-for-high-skilled-immigrants-act 17 posted on 10/06/2025 6:55:09 PM PDT by marcusmaximus [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 15 | View Replies] To: marcusmaximus Add Cisco, Adobe, Fidelity to that list.

Lee and Harris Introduce Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act February 7, 2019 WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Kamala Harris (D-CA) introduced the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act Wednesday, a bill that would remove per-country caps for employment-based green cards. “Immigrants should not be penalized due to their country of origin,” Sen. Lee said. “Treating people fairly and equally is part of our founding creed and the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act reflects that belief. Immigration is often a contentious issue, but we should not delay progress in areas where there is bipartisan consensus just because we have differences in a other areas.” “Ours is a nation of immigrants, and our strength has always come from our diversity and our unity,” Sen. Harris said. “We must do more to eliminate discriminatory backlogs and facilitate family unity so that high-skilled immigrants are not vulnerable to exploitation and can stay in the U.S. and continue to contribute to the economy. I’m proud to join with Senator Lee on this bipartisan legislation to ensure that our country remains vibrant and dynamic.” The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act also increases the per-country caps for family-sponsored green cards from 7 percent to 15 percent. Without adding any new green cards, S. 386 creates a “first-come, first-served” system that alleviates the backlogs and allows green cards to be awarded more efficiently. The bill has broad bipartisan support and is additionally cosponsored by Sens. Roy Blunt (R-MO), Susan Collins (R-ME), Jim Moran (R-KS), Tom Carper (D-DE), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Maria Cantwell D-WA), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Krysten Sinema (D-AZ).

Title: Bitcoin Prices Reach Latest High As Multiple Factors Create ‘Perfect Storm’

ByCharles Lloyd Bovaird II, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin prices rallied to a fresh, all-time high on Monday, October 6, breaking previous records as the digital currency benefited from what one market expert described as a “perfect storm” of bullish factors. “Institutional inflows and Fed rate cuts along with a weakened dollar create the perfect storm for demand in Bitcoin - a hedge against currency debasement,” independent cryptocurrency analyst Armando Aguilar stated via email. Aguilar commented on how the U.S. government shutdown, which began Wednesday, October 1, has fueled robust demand for both bitcoin and gold, which many view as safe-haven assets in times of political uncertainty. “As the U.S. Government has shut down, investors have rotated capital from U.S. assets in favor of Gold and Bitcoin, resulting in higher demand in safe-haven assets, driving prices of both these assets to historical ATH levels,” said Aguilar. He certainly wasn’t the only analyst to highlight the impact of this event, as the YouTuber who goes by Wendy O also focused on this particular development. “The US government shutdown is a significant factor contributing to the price increase of Bitcoin,” she stated via email. “Bitcoin is notably seen as a hedge against economic and government uncertainty and is intended to be used as a hard asset, similar to gold.” Several market observers emphasized the growing role that institutional investors are playing in the markets for the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency. “Institutional demand for Bitcoin has accelerated, as more Digital Asset Treasury Companies have emerged to create Bitcoin strategic reserves, causing an accelerated demand for Bitcoin,” noted Aguilar, “Not to mention the increased Bitcoin ETFs demand from endowments, Sovereign wealth funds and other corporates.” The YouTuber who goes by Wendy O also offered some insight on this situation, emphasizing the fact that the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, which trades under the ticker symbol IBIT, was able to reach $80 billion in assets under management faster than any other exchange-traded fund in history. Several media outlets reported on this milestone back in July, which Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, mentioned via a post on X (formerly Twitter). “It seems that we can further attribute Bitcoin’s growth to the demand of the BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF,” said Wendy O. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, also offered his perspective, emphasizing that both “continued spot ETF inflows” and “renewed institutional demand” have been major contributors to bitcoin’s recent rise above $126,000. The U.S. dollar has been having a rough year, having declined close to 10% since the start of 2025, as measured by the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). The DXY started the year at roughly 108.49, and declined to as little as 96.63 last month, according to MarketWatch data. At the time of this report, the DXY, which measures the strength of the greenback relative to six major fiat currencies, was approximately 98.12, additional MarketWatch figures reveal. Aguilar spoke to this weakness, stating that “YTD, the U.S. dollar has depreciated ~10%, while Gold and Bitcoin have been some of the best performing assets YTD.” Comex futures for gold recently climbed to nearly $4,000, attaining an all-time high, according to Google Finance data.

Title: Why fears of a trillion-dollar AI bubble are growing

By Seth Fiegerman, Carmen Reinicke, Bloomberg News For almost as long as the artificial intelligence boom has been in full swing, there have been warnings of a speculative bubble that could rival the dot-com craze of the late 1990s that ended in a spectacular crash and a wave of bankruptcies. Tech firms are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on advanced chips and data centers, not just to keep pace with a surge in the use of chatbots such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude, but to make sure they’re ready to handle a more fundamental and disruptive shift of economic activity from humans to machines. The final bill may run into the trillions. The financing is coming from venture capital, debt and, lately, some more unconventional arrangements that have raised eyebrows on Wall Street. Even some of AI’s biggest cheerleaders acknowledge the market is frothy, while still professing their belief in the technology’s long-term potential. AI, they say, is poised to reshape multiple industries, cure diseases and generally accelerate human progress. Yet never before has so much money been spent so rapidly on a technology that, for all its potential, remains somewhat unproven as a profit-making business model. Tech industry executives who privately doubt the most effusive assessments of AI’s revolutionary potential — or at least struggle to see how to monetize it — may feel they have little choice but to keep pace with their rivals’ investments or risk being out-scaled and sidelined in the future AI marketplace. When Sam Altman, the chief executive of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure plan known as Stargate alongside other executives at the White House in January, the price tag triggered some disbelief. Since then, other tech rivals have ramped up spending, including Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, who has pledged to invest hundreds of billions in data centers. Not to be outdone, Altman has since said he expects OpenAI to spend “trillions” on AI infrastructure. To finance those projects, OpenAI is entering into new territory. In September, chipmaker Nvidia Corp. announced an agreement to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI’s data center buildout, a deal that some analysts say raises questions about whether the chipmaker is trying to prop up its customers so that they keep spending on its own products. The concerns have followed Nvidia, to varying degrees, for much of the boom. The dominant maker of AI accelerator chips has backed dozens of companies in recent years, including AI model makers and cloud computing providers. Some of them then use that capital to buy Nvidia’s expensive semiconductors. The OpenAI deal was far larger in scale. OpenAI has also indicated it could pursue debt financing, rather than leaning on partners such as Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. The difference is that those companies have rock-solid, established businesses that have been profitable for many years. OpenAI expects to burn through $115 billion of cash through 2029, The Information has reported. Other large tech companies are also relying increasingly on debt to support their unprecedented spending. Meta, for example, turned to lenders to secure $26 billion in financing for a planned data center complex in Louisiana that it says will eventually approach the size of Manhattan. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group are also leading a loan of more than $22 billion to support Vantage Data Centers’ plan to build a massive data-center campus, Bloomberg News has reported. By 2030, AI companies will need $2 trillion in combined annual revenue to fund the computing power needed to meet projected demand, Bain & Co. said in a report released in September. Yet their revenue is likely to fall $800 billion short of that mark, Bain predicted. “The numbers that are being thrown around are so extreme that it’s really, really hard to understand them,” said David Einhorn, a prominent hedge fund manager and founder of Greenlight Capital. “I’m sure it’s not zero, but there’s a reasonable chance that a tremendous amount of capital destruction is going to come through this cycle.” In a sign of the times, there’s also a growing number of less proven firms trying to capitalize on the data center goldrush. Nebius, an Amsterdam-based cloud provider that split off from Russian internet giant Yandex in 2024, recently inked an infrastructure deal with Microsoft worth up to $19.4 billion. And Nscale, a little-known British data center company, is working with Nvidia, OpenAI and Microsoft on build-outs in Europe. Like some other AI infrastructure providers, Nscale previously focused on another frothy sector: cryptocurrency mining. The data center spending spree is overshadowed by persistent skepticism about the payoff from AI technology. In August, investors were rattled after researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that 95% of organizations saw zero return on their investment in AI initiatives. More recently, researchers at Harvard and Stanford offered a possible explanation for why. Employees are using AI to create “workslop,” which the researchers define as “AI generated work content that masquerades as good work, but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a given task.” The promise of AI has long been that it would help streamline tasks and boost productivity, making it an invaluable asset for workers and one that corporations would pay top dollar for. Instead, the Harvard and Stanford researchers found the prevalence of workslop could cost larger organizations millions of dollars a year in lost productivity. AI developers have also been confronting a different challenge. OpenAI, Claude chatbot developer Anthropic and others have for years bet on the so-called scaling laws — the idea that more computing power, data and larger models will inevitably pave the way for greater leaps in the power of AI. Eventually, they say, these advances will lead to artificial general intelligence, a hypothetical form of the technology so sophisticated that it matches or exceeds humans in most tasks. Over the past year, however, these developers have experienced diminishing returns from their costly efforts to build more advanced AI. Some have also struggled to match their own hype. After months of touting GPT-5 as a significant leap, OpenAI’s release of its latest AI model in August was met with mixed reviews. In remarks around the launch, Altman conceded that “we’re still missing something quite important” to reach AGI. Those concerns are compounded by growing competition from China, where companies are flooding the market with competitive, low-cost AI models. While U.S. firms are generally still viewed as ahead in the race, the Chinese alternatives risk undercutting Silicon Valley on price in certain markets, making it harder to recoup the significant investment in AI infrastructure. There’s also the risk that the AI industry’s vast data center buildout, entailing a huge increase in electricity consumption, will be held back by the realities of strained national power networks. Sam Altman, the face of the current AI boom, has repeatedly acknowledged the risk of a bubble in recent months while maintaining his optimism for the technology. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? In my opinion, yes,” he said in August. “Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.” Altman and other tech leaders continue to express confidence in the roadmap toward AGI, with some suggesting it could be closer than skeptics think. “Developing superintelligence is now in sight,” Zuckerberg wrote in July, referencing an even more powerful form of AI that his company is aiming for. In the near term, some AI developers also say they need to drastically ramp up computing capacity to support the rapid adoption of their services. Altman, in particular, has stressed repeatedly that OpenAI remains constrained in computing resources as hundreds of millions of people around the world use its services to converse with ChatGPT, write code and generate images and videos. OpenAI and Anthropic have also released their own research and evaluations that indicate AI systems are having a meaningful impact on work tasks, in contrast to the more damning reports from outside academic institutions. An Anthropic report released in September found that roughly three quarters of companies are using Claude to automate work. The same month, OpenAI released a new evaluation system called GDPval that measures the performance of AI models across dozens of occupations. “We found that today’s best frontier models are already approaching the quality of work produced by industry experts,” OpenAI said in a blog post. “Especially on the subset of tasks where models are particularly strong, we expect that giving a task to a model before trying it with a human would save time and money.” So how much will customers eventually be willing to pay for these services? The hope among developers is that, as AI models improve and field more complex tasks on users’ behalf, they will be able to convince businesses and individuals to spend far more to access the technology. “I want the door open to everything,” OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said in late 2024, when asked about a report that the company has discussed a $2,000 monthly subscription for its AI products. “If it’s helping me move about the world with literally a Ph.D.-level assistant for anything that I’m doing, there are certainly cases where that would make all the sense in the world.” In September, Zuckerberg said an AI bubble is “quite possible,” but stressed that his bigger concern is not spending enough to meet the opportunity. “If we end up misspending a couple of hundred billion dollars, I think that that is going to be very unfortunate, obviously,” he said in a podcast interview. “But what I’d say is I actually think the risk is higher on the other side.” Bubbles are economic cycles defined by a swift increase in market values to levels that aren’t supported by the underlying fundamentals. They’re usually followed by a sharp selloff — the so-called pop. A bubble often begins when investors get swept up in a speculative frenzy — over a new technology or other market opportunity — and pile in for fear of missing out on further gains. American economist Hyman Minsky identified five stages of a market bubble: displacement, boom, euphoria, profit-taking and panic. Bubbles are sometimes difficult to spot because market prices can become dislocated from real-world values for many reasons, and a sharp price drop isn’t always inevitable. And, because a crash is part of a bubble cycle, they can be hard to pinpoint until after the fact. Generally, bubbles pop when investors realize that the lofty expectations they had were too high. This usually follows a period of over-exuberance that tips into mania, when everyone is buying into the trend at the very top. What comes next is a usually a slow, prolonged selloff where company earnings start to suffer, or a singular event that changes the long-term view, sending investors dashing for the exits. There was some fear that an AI bubble had already popped in late January, when China’s DeepSeek upended the market with the release of a competitive AI model purportedly built at a fraction of the amount that top U.S. developers spend. DeepSeek’s viral success triggered a trillion-dollar selloff of technology shares. Nvidia, a bellwether AI stock, slumped 17% in one day. The DeepSeek episode underscored the risks of investing heavily in AI. But Silicon Valley remained largely undeterred. In the months that followed, tech companies redoubled their costly AI spending plans, and investors resumed cheering on these bets. Nvidia shares charged back from an April low to fresh records. It was worth more than $4 trillion by the end of September, making it the most valuable company in the world. As with today’s AI boom, the companies at the center of the dot-com frenzy drew in vast amounts of investor capital, often using questionable metrics such as website traffic rather than their actual ability to turn a profit. There were many flawed business models and exaggerated revenue projections. Telecommunication companies raced to build fiber-optic networks only to find the demand wasn’t there to pay for them. When it all crashed in 2001, many companies were liquidated, others absorbed by healthier rivals at knocked-down prices. Echoes of the dot-com era can be found in AI’s massive infrastructure build-out, sky-high valuations and showy displays of wealth. Venture capital investors have been courting AI startups with private jets, box seats and big checks. Many AI startups tout their recurring revenue as a key metric for growth, but there are doubts as to how sustainable or predictable those projections are, particularly for younger businesses. Some AI firms are completing multiple mammoth fundraisings in a single year. Not all will necessarily flourish. “I think there’s a lot of parallels to the internet bubble,” said Bret Taylor, OpenAI’s chairman and the CEO of Sierra, an AI startup valued at $10 billion. Like the dot-com era, a number of high-flying companies will almost certainly go bust. But in Taylor’s telling, there will also be large businesses that emerge and thrive over the long term, just as happened with Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google in the late 90s. “It is both true that AI will transform the economy, and I think it will, like the internet, create huge amounts of economic value in the future,” Taylor said. “I think we’re also in a bubble, and a lot of people will lose a lot of money.” Amazon Chairman Jeff Bezos said the spending on AI resembles an “industrial bubble” akin to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, but he still expects it to improve the productivity of “every company in the world.” There are also some key differences to the dot-com boom that market watchers point out, the first being the broad health and stability of the biggest businesses that are at the forefront of the trend. Most of the “Magnificent Seven” group of U.S. tech companies are long-established giants that make up much of the earnings growth in the S&P 500 Index. These firms have huge revenue streams and are sitting on large stockpiles of cash. Despite the skepticism, AI adoption has also proceeded at a rapid clip. OpenAI’s ChatGPT has about 700 million weekly users, making it one of the fastest growing consumer products in history. Top AI developers, including OpenAI and Anthropic, have also seen remarkably strong sales growth. OpenAI previously forecast revenue would more than triple in 2025 to $12.7 billion. While the company does not expect to be cash-flow positive until near the end of this decade, a recent deal to help employees sell shares gave it an implied valuation of $500 billion — making it the world’s most valuable company never to have turned a profit.

The same month, OpenAI released a new evaluation system called GDPval that measures the performance of AI models across dozens of occupations. “We found that today’s best frontier models are already approaching the quality of work produced by industry experts,” OpenAI said in a blog post. “Especially on the subset of tasks where models are particularly strong, we expect that giving a task to a model before trying it with a human would save time and money.” So how much will customers eventually be willing to pay for these services? The hope among developers is that, as AI models improve and field more complex tasks on users’ behalf, they will be able to convince businesses and individuals to spend far more to access the technology. “I want the door open to everything,” OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said in late 2024, when asked about a report that the company has discussed a $2,000 monthly subscription for its AI products. “If it’s helping me move about the world with literally a Ph.D.-level assistant for anything that I’m doing, there are certainly cases where that would make all the sense in the world.” In September, Zuckerberg said an AI bubble is “quite possible,” but stressed that his bigger concern is not spending enough to meet the opportunity. “If we end up misspending a couple of hundred billion dollars, I think that that is going to be very unfortunate, obviously,” he said in a podcast interview. “But what I’d say is I actually think the risk is higher on the other side.” Bubbles are economic cycles defined by a swift increase in market values to levels that aren’t supported by the underlying fundamentals. They’re usually followed by a sharp selloff — the so-called pop. A bubble often begins when investors get swept up in a speculative frenzy — over a new technology or other market opportunity — and pile in for fear of missing out on further gains. American economist Hyman Minsky identified five stages of a market bubble: displacement, boom, euphoria, profit-taking and panic. Bubbles are sometimes difficult to spot because market prices can become dislocated from real-world values for many reasons, and a sharp price drop isn’t always inevitable. And, because a crash is part of a bubble cycle, they can be hard to pinpoint until after the fact. Generally, bubbles pop when investors realize that the lofty expectations they had were too high. This usually follows a period of over-exuberance that tips into mania, when everyone is buying into the trend at the very top. What comes next is a usually a slow, prolonged selloff where company earnings start to suffer, or a singular event that changes the long-term view, sending investors dashing for the exits. There was some fear that an AI bubble had already popped in late January, when China’s DeepSeek upended the market with the release of a competitive AI model purportedly built at a fraction of the amount that top U.S. developers spend. DeepSeek’s viral success triggered a trillion-dollar selloff of technology shares. Nvidia, a bellwether AI stock, slumped 17% in one day. The DeepSeek episode underscored the risks of investing heavily in AI. But Silicon Valley remained largely undeterred. In the months that followed, tech companies redoubled their costly AI spending plans, and investors resumed cheering on these bets. Nvidia shares charged back from an April low to fresh records. It was worth more than $4 trillion by the end of September, making it the most valuable company in the world. As with today’s AI boom, the companies at the center of the dot-com frenzy drew in vast amounts of investor capital, often using questionable metrics such as website traffic rather than their actual ability to turn a profit. There were many flawed business models and exaggerated revenue projections. Telecommunication companies raced to build fiber-optic networks only to find the demand wasn’t there to pay for them. When it all crashed in 2001, many companies were liquidated, others absorbed by healthier rivals at knocked-down prices. Echoes of the dot-com era can be found in AI’s massive infrastructure build-out, sky-high valuations and showy displays of wealth. Venture capital investors have been courting AI startups with private jets, box seats and big checks. Many AI startups tout their recurring revenue as a key metric for growth, but there are doubts as to how sustainable or predictable those projections are, particularly for younger businesses. Some AI firms are completing multiple mammoth fundraisings in a single year. Not all will necessarily flourish. “I think there’s a lot of parallels to the internet bubble,” said Bret Taylor, OpenAI’s chairman and the CEO of Sierra, an AI startup valued at $10 billion. Like the dot-com era, a number of high-flying companies will almost certainly go bust. But in Taylor’s telling, there will also be large businesses that emerge and thrive over the long term, just as happened with Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google in the late 90s. “It is both true that AI will transform the economy, and I think it will, like the internet, create huge amounts of economic value in the future,” Taylor said. “I think we’re also in a bubble, and a lot of people will lose a lot of money.” Amazon Chairman Jeff Bezos said the spending on AI resembles an “industrial bubble” akin to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, but he still expects it to improve the productivity of “every company in the world.” There are also some key differences to the dot-com boom that market watchers point out, the first being the broad health and stability of the biggest businesses that are at the forefront of the trend. Most of the “Magnificent Seven” group of U.S. tech companies are long-established giants that make up much of the earnings growth in the S&P 500 Index. These firms have huge revenue streams and are sitting on large stockpiles of cash. Despite the skepticism, AI adoption has also proceeded at a rapid clip. OpenAI’s ChatGPT has about 700 million weekly users, making it one of the fastest growing consumer products in history. Top AI developers, including OpenAI and Anthropic, have also seen remarkably strong sales growth. OpenAI previously forecast revenue would more than triple in 2025 to $12.7 billion. While the company does not expect to be cash-flow positive until near the end of this decade, a recent deal to help employees sell shares gave it an implied valuation of $500 billion — making it the world’s most valuable company never to have turned a profit.

AWS Blogs Are you modernizing your legacy batch processing systems? At Vanguard, we faced significant challenges with our legacy mainframe system that limited our ability to deliver modern, personalized customer experiences. Our centralized database architecture created performance bottlenecks and made it difficult to scale services independently for our millions of personal and institutional investors. In this post, we show you how we modernized our data architecture using Amazon Redshift as our Operational Read-only Data Store (ORDS). You’ll learn how we transitioned to a cloud-native, domain-driven architecture while preserving critical batch processing capabilities. We show you how this solution enabled us to create logically isolated data domains while maintaining cross-domain analytics capabilities—all while adhering to the principles of bounded contexts and distributed data ownership. Background and challenges As financial needs continue to evolve, Vanguard is committed to delivering adaptable, top-notch experiences that foster long-lasting customer relationships. This commitment spans from enhancing the personal investor journey to bringing personalized mobile dashboards and connecting institutional clients with advanced advice offerings. To elevate customer experience and drive digital transformation, Vanguard has embraced domain-driven design principles. This approach focuses on creating autonomous teams, fostering faster innovation, and building data mesh architecture. Central to this transformation is the Personal Investor team’s mainframe modernization effort, transitioning from a legacy system to a cloud-based, distributed data architecture organized around bounded contexts – distinct business domains that manage their own data. As part of this shift, each microservice now manages its own local data store using Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition or Amazon DynamoDB. This approach enables domain-level data ownership and operational autonomy. Vanguard’s existing mainframe system, built on a centralized Db2 database, enables cross-domain data access and integration but also introduces several architectural challenges. Though batch processes can join data across multiple bounded contexts using SQL joins and database operations to integrate information from various sources, this tight coupling creates significant risks and operational issues. Challenges with the centralized database approach include: To address these architectural challenges, we chose to use Amazon Redshift as our Operational Read-only Data Store (ORDS). The Amazon Redshift architecture has compute and storage separation, which enables us to create multi-cluster architectures with a separate endpoint for each domain with independent scaling of compute and storage resources. Our solution leverages the data sharing capabilities of Amazon Redshift to create logically isolated data domains while maintaining the ability to perform cross-domain analytics when needed. Key benefits of the Amazon Redshift solution include: Let’s explore the different solutions we evaluated before selecting ORDS with Amazon Redshift as our optimal approach. We implemented ORDS as our optimal solution after conducting a comprehensive evaluation of available options. This section outlines our decision-making process and examines the alternatives we considered during our assessment. Operational Read-only Data Store (ORDS): In our evaluation, we found that using Amazon Redshift for ORDS provides a powerful solution for handling data across different business areas. It excels at managing large volumes of data from multiple sources, providing fast access to replicated data for batch processes that require cross-bounded context data, and combining information using familiar SQL queries. The solution particularly shines in handling high-volume reads from our data sources. Advantages: Disadvantages: Here are the other solutions we evaluated: Bulk APIs: We found that Bulk APIs provides an approach for handling large volumes of data. Advantages: Disadvantages: While Bulk APIs offer powerful capabilities, we found they require substantial team coordination and careful implementation to be effective. Data Lake: Our evaluation showed that data lakes can effectively combine information from different parts of our business. They excel at processing large amounts of data at once, providing search capabilities through unified data formats, and managing large volumes of diverse and complex data. Advantages: Disadvantages: While data lakes excel at big-picture analysis of large datasets, they weren’t optimal for our real-time data needs and complex data relationships. S3 Export/Exchange: In our analysis, we found that S3 Export/Exchange provides a method for sharing data between different business areas using file storage. This approach effectively handles large volumes of data and allows straightforward filtering of information using data frames. Advantages: Disadvantages: While S3 Export/Exchange works well for sharing large datasets between teams, it didn’t meet our requirements for quick, real-time access or immediately usable data formats. The following table provides a high-level comparison of the different data integration solutions we considered for our modernization efforts. It outlines where each solution is most appropriate to use and when it might not be the best choice: Fetching specific data subsets Many bounded context Large volume batch processing Point-in-time export is sufficient Structured, transactional data processing Many bounded contexts Table 1: Data Integration Solutions Comparison Based on our comparison, we found ORDS to be the optimal solution for our needs, particularly when our batch processes require access to data from multiple bounded contexts in real-time. Our implementation efficiently handles large volumes of data, significantly improving the performance of our batch jobs. We chose ORDS because it stores data in a familiar table format, accessible via SQL, making it simple and efficient for our teams to use. The architecture also aligns with our domain-driven design principles by enforcing clear data ownership, where each bounded context maintains responsibility for its own data management. This approach provides us with both scalability and reliability, reducing the risk of a single point of failure. Amazon Redshift serves as the backbone of our ORDS implementation, offering several crucial features that support our modernization goals: Data Sharing Our solution leveraged the robust data sharing capabilities of Amazon Redshift, available on both Server-based Redshift RA3 instances and Redshift Serverless options. This functionality provided us with instant, secure, and live data access without copies, maintaining transactional consistency across our environment. The flexibility of same account, cross-account, and cross-Region data sharing has been particularly valuable for our distributed architecture. High Performance We’ve achieved significant performance improvements through Amazon Redshift’s efficient query processing and data retrieval capabilities. The system effectively handles our complex data needs while maintaining robust performance across various workloads and data volumes. Multi-Availability Zone Support Our implementation benefited from Amazon Redshift’s Multi-AZ support, which maintains high availability and reliability for our critical operations. This feature minimizes downtime without requiring extensive setup and significantly reduces our risk of data loss. Familiar Interface The relational environment of Amazon Redshift, similar traditional databases like Amazon RDS and IBM Db2, has enabled a smooth transition for our teams. This familiarity has accelerated adoption and improved productivity, as our teams can leverage their existing SQL expertise. By centralizing data from multiple business areas in ORDS using Amazon Redshift, we maintain consistent, efficient, and secure data access across our product teams. This setup is particularly valuable for our batch processing that requires data from various parts of the business, offering us a blend of performance, reliability, and ease of use. Here’s how our ORDS architecture implements Amazon Redshift data sharing to solve these challenges: Figure 1: Vanguard’s ORDS Architecture using Amazon Redshift Data Sharing Amazon Redshift Ingestion Pattern: We utilized Amazon Redshift’s zero-ETL functionality to integrate data and enable real-time analytics directly on operational data, which helped reduce complexity and maintenance overhead. To complement this capability and to fulfill our comprehensive compliance requirements that necessitate complete transaction replication, we implemented additional data ingestion pipelines. Our data ingestion strategy for Amazon Redshift employs different AWS services depending on the source. For Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL databases, we use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to directly replicate data into Amazon Redshift. For data from Amazon DynamoDB, we leverage Amazon Kinesis to stream the data into Amazon Redshift, where it lands in materialized views. These views are then further processed to generate tables for end-users. This approach allows us to efficiently ingest data from our operational data stores while meeting both analytical needs and compliance requirements. Amazon Redshift Data Sharing: We used the Amazon Redshift’s data sharing feature to effectively decouple our data producers from consumers, allowing each group to operate within their own boundaries while maintaining a unified and simplified governed mechanism for data sharing. Our implementation followed a clear process: once data is ingested and available in Amazon Redshift table format, we created views for consumers to access the data. We then established data shares and granted access to these views to consumer Amazon Redshift data warehouses for batch processing. In our environment with multiple bounded contexts, we’ve established a collaborative model where consumers work with various producer teams to access data from different data shares, each created per bounded context. This access remained strictly read-only—when consumers need to update or write new data that falls outside their bounded context, they must use APIs or other designated mechanisms for such operations. This approach has proven effective for our organization, promoting clear data ownership and governance while enabling flexible data access across organizational boundaries. It simplified our data management and made sure each team can operate independently while still sharing data effectively. Disclaimer: This is provided for reference purposes only and does not represent a real example. Let’s look at a practical example: our brokerage account statement generation process. This cross-bounded context batch process requires integrating data from multiple sources, accessing hundreds of tables and processing large volumes of data monthly. The challenge was to create an efficient, cost-effective solution that minimizes data replication while maintaining data accessibility.ORDS proved ideal for this use case, as it provides data from multiple bounded contexts without replication, offers near real-time access, and enables straightforward data aggregation using SQL-like queries in Amazon Redshift. The following diagram shows how we implemented this solution: Figure 2: Cross-Bounded Context Example for Brokerage Account Statement Generation We need the following bounded contexts to generate brokerage statements for millions of our clients. Through this architecture, we efficiently generate accurate and comprehensive brokerage account statements by consolidating data from these bounded contexts, meeting both our clients’ needs and regulatory requirements. Our journey with the Operational Read-only Data Store (ORDS) and Amazon Redshift has enhanced our client experience (CX) through improved data management and accessibility. By transitioning from our mainframe system to a cloud-based, domain-driven architecture, we have empowered our autonomous teams and established a resilient batch architecture. This shift facilitates efficient cross-domain data access, maintains high-quality data consistency, and provides scalability. Our ORDS implementation, supported by Amazon Redshift, offers near-real-time access to large data volumes, guaranteeing high performance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. This modernization effort aligns with our mission to deliver exceptional, personalized client experiences and sustain long-lasting client relationships. If you are facing similar challenges with your batch processing systems, we encourage you to explore how an Operational Read-only Data Store (ORDS) can transform your data architecture. Start by assessing your current system’s limitations and identifying opportunities for improvement through domain-driven design and cloud-based solutions. Consider how this approach can help you manage large volumes of data from multiple sources, provide fast access to replicated data for batch processes, and support high-volume reads from various data sources. Take the next step by conducting a proof of concept (POC) to evaluate ORDS effectiveness in achieving efficient cross-domain data access, improving the performance of batch jobs, and maintaining clear data ownership within your business domains. By implementing this solution, you can enhance your data management capabilities, reduce operational risks, and drive innovation within your organization. Embrace this opportunity to elevate your data architecture and deliver exceptional customer experiences. Our transition to a cloud-native, domain-driven architecture with ORDS using Amazon Redshift has successfully transformed our batch processing capabilities in AWS cloud. This modernization effort has significantly enhanced the performance, reliability, and scalability of our batch operations while maintaining seamless data access and integration across different business domains. The strategic adoption of ORDS has harnessed the potential of cross-domain data access in a distributed environment, providing us with a robust solution for real-time data access and efficient batch processing. This transformation has empowered us to better meet the demands of the digital age, delivering superior customer experiences and reinforcing our commitment to innovation in the financial services industry.

Grayscale has debuted staking to its Ether and Solana investment products, becoming the first-ever crypto fund issuer to feature staking rewards via U.S.-listed spot crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs). Grayscale announced on Monday that it has introduced staking functionality to its Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE), the second-biggest such fund on Wall Street with $4.82 billion in net assets, as well as its Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH), describing the development as “another first-mover milestone” for the company. “Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (Ticker: ETHE) and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (Ticker: ETH) have become the first U.S.-listed spot crypto ETPs to enable staking,” the company said in a Monday announcement. Today, Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (Ticker: $ETH) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (Ticker: $ETHE) have become the first U.S.-listed spot crypto exchange-traded products (ETP) to enable staking, another first-mover milestone for the firm. Grayscale Solana Trust (OTCQX:… pic.twitter.com/45963Bn9UW Staking has also been enabled for the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL), which is awaiting regulatory approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to be converted into an exchange-traded fund. If approved, GSOL could become one of the first spot Solana ETPs with staking. Staking is key to how proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum and Solana function. Users help validate transactions and keep the network secure by staking their funds and earning tokens in return. By activating staking, Grayscale gives investors exposure to ETH and SOL, while earning rewards from the blockchain networks without directly holding or managing the underlying assets. Grayscale indicated that it will stake assets passively via institutional custodians and a diversified network of validator partners, aiming to help secure the protocols while supporting long-term network resilience. In a statement, Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg said staking in the ETH and SOL funds was “exactly the kind of first-mover innovation” that the company was designed to deliver. “As the #1 digital asset-focused ETF issuer in the world by AUM, we believe our trusted and scaled platform uniquely positions us to turn new opportunities like staking into tangible value potential for investors,” Mintzberg added. Grayscale plans to roll out staking to additional products “as the digital asset ecosystem evolves.” The key selling point could help Grayscale close the gap with BlackRock, whose Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs currently dominate the flourishing sector.

IBIT now generates more revenue for BlackRock than funds that have been operating for decades. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) has approached $100 billion in assets under management, making it the firm’s most profitable ETF despite its launch just 435 days ago. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted on Oct. 6 that IBIT now generates more revenue for BlackRock than funds that have been operating for decades. The age disparity stands out sharply in BlackRock’s top 10 revenue generators. At one year old, IBIT outearns the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF, which has been operating for 25 years and holds $121.8 billion in assets. The iShares MSCI EAFE ETF and the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, despite managing $68.4 billion and $701 billion, respectively, also trail IBIT in profitability over 24 years of operation. IBIT charges a 0.25% fee on assets, generating approximately $244.5 million in annual revenue at current levels. The fund’s profitability stems from both its substantial asset base and relatively high fee compared to BlackRock’s Core S&P 500 ETF, which charges zero basis points. Balchunas also shared that IBIT sits $2 billion away from the $100 billion threshold and is on track to shatter the record for the fastest ETF to reach that milestone. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF currently holds that record at 2,011 days. IBIT will complete the journey in roughly one-fifth of that time. The Bitcoin ETF’s velocity extends beyond individual fund comparisons. IBIT and BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) pulled in $10 billion in monthly inflows as of Oct. 5, ranking third and fourth among all ETFs for monthly flows. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart highlighted that Bitcoin ETFs collectively pulled in $3.3 billion in the week ending Oct. 3, pushing year-to-date inflows to $24 billion and lifetime flows to approximately $60 billion. The $60 billion mark represents a new high-water mark for the product category since launch in January 2024. Bitcoin hit new all-time highs following a surge in ETF inflows, briefly crossing $125,500 on Oct. 6. The cumulative flow chart shows a steady acceleration from $12 billion in March 2024 to $40.25 billion in February 2025, followed by a jump to $59.54 billion by October 2025.

Title: Cathie Wood's ARK Bets on Tokenization With a Stake in BlackRock-Backed Securitize

ARK Invest, the asset management firm led by CEO Cathie Wood, is leaning into the tokenization boom by taking a stake in tokenization specialist Securitize as Wall Street races to bring assets onchain. The ARK Venture Fund (ARKVX), ARK's closed-end, actively managed fund that invests in public and private companies, held 3.25% of its assets in Securitize, making the firm the fund's eighth largest position following artificial intelligence (AI) companies X.AI and Anthropic, according to the fund's latest disclosure dated September 30. Based on the fund's $325.3 million in net assets under management as of September 30, ARK’s stake in Securitize should be valued at roughly $10 million, according to CoinDesk's calculation. ARK's investment comes as tokenization emerges as one of the hottest trends in crypto, bringing traditional financial instruments such as bonds, funds and stocks onto blockchain rails. Global banks and asset managers are exploring tokenization to cut settlement times, broaden investor access and keep markets open around the clock. It's potentially a huge opportunity: the tokenized asset market has grown 112% to $33 billion year-to-date, RWA.xyz data shows, and could swell to $18.9 trillion by 2033, Ripple and BCG projected earlier this year. "ARK Invest’s strategic investment reflects growing conviction among leading institutional investors that tokenization will fundamentally transform capital markets," Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo said on Tuesday in a statement announcing ARK's investment in his firm. Securitize, founded in 2017, is one of the early pioneers of the tokenization space. It issued $4.6 billion in tokenized assets working with traditional finance giants such as BlackRock, Hamilton Lane and Apollo. It is also known as the issuer behind BlackRock's tokenized money market fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) that's leading the tokenized U.S. Treasury sector with $2.8 billion in assets. The firm is also active in equity tokenization, creating on-chain shares of listed wallet provider Exodus in 2022 and entering into an agreement with ether ETH$4,465.92 treasury firm FG Nexus (FGNX) to introduce its common and preferred stock to the Ethereum blockchain. ARK's investment follows Securitize's $47 million fundraising round last year, led by BlackRock and Hamilton Lane (HLNE), with ParaFi Capital and Tradeweb Markets (TW) also participating.

Title: OpenAI to buy $10B+ worth of AMD hardware, stock through new partnership
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/06/openai-buy-10b-worth-amd-hardware-stock-new-partnership/
Time Published: 2025-10-06T19:25:05Z

UPDATED 15:25 EDT / OCTOBER 06 2025 by Maria Deutscher OpenAI will buy tens of billions of dollars’ worth of data center hardware from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. as part of a partnership announced today. The ChatGPT developer could also receive the option to purchase about 160 million AMD shares, which represents an approximately 10% stake. The amount of stock that OpenAI will buy depends partly on how well it fulfills the terms of the partnership. The collaboration will see the artificial intelligence provider deploy 6 gigawatts’ worth of AMD graphics processing units to power its workloads. OpenAI will kick off the project with a one gigawatt deployment of the chipmaker’s upcoming Instinct MI450 GPU series. According to OpenAI, work on that initial cluster will begin in the second half of 2026. The MI450 is the planned successor to the MI355X, AMD’s flagship data center AI accelerator. The MI355X is a liquid-cooled GPU that includes 10 chiplets, three different types of AI cores and 288 gigabytes of HBM3E memory. It can provide more than 10 petaflops of performance when processing FP4 numbers, lightweight units of data that AI models often use in calculations. “With energy and cost critical issues, infrastructure decisions will increasingly be driven by a platform’s ability to deliver the best balance of speed, economics, and energy efficiency for each application it’s running,” said Sid Sheth, the co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of AI hardware startup d-Matrix Inc. The MI355X is designed for use in both AI clusters and supercomputers. It’s believed the upcoming MI450 will have a more specialized design optimized solely for AI infrastructure. According to a May report, the chip will lack support for certain data formats that are commonly used in supercomputers but aren’t as popular among language model developers. It’s believed the MI450 will also support a technology called Ultra Accelerator Link, or UALink for short. It’s an open-source interconnect for linking together the GPUs in AI clusters. The current iteration of the standard supports clusters with up to 1,024 AI accelerators. OpenAI and AMD describe their partnership as a “multi-year, multi-generation agreement.” That hints the ChatGPT developer plans to purchase not only the MI450 but also subsequent generations of chips. “Our partnership with OpenAI is expected to deliver tens of billions of dollars in revenue for AMD while accelerating OpenAI’s AI infrastructure buildout,” said AMD Chief Financial Officer Jean Hu. It’s possible the deal will see OpenAI buy not only chips but also other types of hardware. Last year, AMD spent $4.8 billion to acquire ZT Systems Inc., a low-profile developer of servers and rack-scale systems. In May, SemiAnalysis reported that the chipmaker plans to ship the MI450 as part of rack-scale appliances that will each contain 128 GPUs. The appliances are expected to launch in the second half of 2026, which is when OpenAI plans to start building its initial one gigawatt MI450 deployment. The partnership with AMD includes a stock warrant that will give OpenAI the option to buy 160 million shares of the chipmaker’s shares if certain conditions are met. The first batch of shares is set to vest once OpenAI sets up its initial one gigawatt deployment. According to AMD, the remaining stock will become available gradually as additional data center capacity comes online. OpenAI must also fulfill certain other requirements to access the shares. It will have to meet “technical and commercial milestones required to enable AMD deployments at scale,” the companies said. Additionally, the chipmaker’s share price will have to top a certain unspecified threshold. The tie-up comes less than a month after Nvidia Corp. agreed to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a similar partnership. The ChatGPT developer will deploy at least 10 gigawatts’ worth of hardware powered by Vera Rubin, Nvidia’s next flagship AI chip. Like AMD’s MI450 series, the processor is expected to start shipping in the second half of 2026. Support our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

European shares lost ground on Monday as French assets sold off in the wake of the country’s latest round of political turmoil. Propelled by Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD’s) multibillion-dollar chip deal with OpenAI, US share indices surged to record highs as technology stocks mostly climbed. The Iseq index dropped 0.5 per cent on the eve of Budget 2026, largely in line with its European peers. Engineering and drilling equipment group Mincon was the biggest winner, jumping 7 per cent as global metals prices climbed. Banking stocks, meanwhile, slid with AIB and Bank of Ireland down 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent to €7.83 and €14.30 per share at the close, respectively. Ryanair advanced by 0.7 per cent to €24.65 per share, outperforming its European rivals on the session. Housebuilders Glenveagh and Cairn Homes lost ground, declining by 0.9 per cent 1.2 per cent respectively. European share indices were pulled lower by falling French stocks after the sudden resignation of the country’s prime minister. The blue-chip Stoxx 50 index slid 0.4 per cent while the pan-European Stoxx 60 was largely unchanged. France’s CAC 40 index shed 1.4 per cent, sparking worries about further political turmoil in the country. Banks and insurers dropped, with BNP Paribas falling 3.2 per cent and Axa down 2.3 per cent, while Credit Agricole and Societe Generale also fell. French luxury names were also in the firing line. LVMH gave up 2.3 per cent while Gucci owner Kering dipped 1.8 per cent. Tech and auto stocks limited the decline in European indices. Stellantis added 3.4 per cent after announcing plans to invest heavily in the US, while BMW advanced by 3.3 per cent. UK share indices finished down slightly, with the FTSE 100 retreating 0.1 per cent from record highs, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 dipped by 0.4 per cent. Mondi plunged 16 per cent as it revealed that profitability had dwindled in the third quarter of this year, primarily due to softer volumes and weaker prices. The Weybridge-based packaging firm, a rival to Smurfit-Westrock, saw its underlying earnings drop 19 per cent to €223 million for the third quarter of 2025, from €274 million in the second quarter, but remained flat compared with the third quarter of last year. A fresh surge in the gold price boosted Fresnillo, up 1.2 per cent, and Endeavour Mining, up 2.8 per cent. Oil majors BP and Shell added 2.1 per cent and 1.3 per cent, tracking rising crude prices. On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose on Monday, building on last week’s gains, as AMD’s chip-supply deal with OpenAI highlighted the extent of investor enthusiasm around AI and offset concerns around the federal government shutdown. AMD became the latest catalyst after striking a deal with OpenAI, which pushed the chip designer’s shares to their highest level in more than a year. The stock was last up 28.8 per cent and the top performer on the benchmark index. Among stocks, some chip companies such as Marvell Technology and Micron Technology gained 2.9 per cent and 3.5 per cent, respectively. AI-linked firms such as Super Micro Computer, Palantir Technologies and Oracle jumped 4.4 per cent, 3.7 per cent and 2.6 per cent, respectively. Tesla gained 4 per cent after it teased an October 7 event, with investors and analysts anticipating a more affordable electric vehicle model. Regional bank Comerica gained 15.5 per cent after Fifth Third said it will buy the company in an all-stock deal valued at $10.9 billion. – Additional reporting: PA, Reuters, Bloomberg Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: AI could wipe out 100M US jobs – from nurses to truck drivers – over the next decade: report

Artificial intelligence and automation could wipe out nearly 100 million jobs in the US over the next decade, according to a report released by Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) on Monday. The analysis – ironically based on ChatGPT findings – found the new tech could erase jobs from a wide range of fields, including white- and blue-collar roles. AI, automation and robotics could hit 40% of registered nurses, 47% of truck drivers, 64% of accountants, 65% of teaching assistants and 89% of fast food workers, according to Sanders, ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions. “The agricultural revolution unfolded over thousands of years. The industrial revolution took more than a century,” the report said. “Artificial labor could reshape the economy in less than a decade.” Debates over AI regulation have been heating up in Washington. Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday. Please provide a valid email. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. The Trump administration has argued that the US should lead the world in AI development, claiming it could pose a national security threat if China wins the race. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats are calling for increased regulation on the sector – as well as worker protections like a 32-hour workweek and a “robot tax” on companies switching to automation. Amazon and Walmart – two of the largest publicly-traded US companies by revenue – have already slashed tens of thousands of jobs as they have leaned into automation efforts. In an op-ed for Fox News on Monday, Sanders warned that the “artificial intelligence and robotics being developed by these multi-billionaires today will allow corporate America to wipe out tens of millions of decent-paying jobs, cut labor costs and boost profits.” He argued that AI is simply being used as a tool to further concentrate wealth, nodding to CEOs who have invested billions into automation while announcing mass layoffs and cost-cutting measures. Sanders warned of a devastating hit to workers in the manufacturing industry, as well as truck, bus and taxi drivers, as automakers and tech startups increasingly ramp up their self-driving projects. “Some of the very wealthiest people in the world, including Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos – are now investing hundreds of billions into these revolutionary technologies,” Sanders wrote in his op-ed. “Why is that? Is it because they want to improve the standard of living of the 60% of our people who live paycheck-to-paycheck – Americans who are struggling to pay for groceries, healthcare, housing and education? Maybe. But I doubt it.” “I think it’s because investing in AI and robotics will increase their wealth and power exponentially,” he continued. Advertisement

Micron Technology's (MU) stock has had a strong run in 2025 so far, and some Wall Street bulls say it's set to move. higher, as AI-driven orders grow. The memory chip maker's shares were up about 3% to around $193 in recent trading, extending their recent rally and putting them on track to top Friday's closing record. The stock has added more than half its value since the year began, making it one of the S&P 500's top performers for 2025. Morgan Stanley analysts upgraded the stock to “overweight” from a neutral rating on Monday, and lifted their price target to $220 from $160, a bit above the $196 average target compiled by Visible Alpha, pointing to booming demand for its high-bandwidth memory to support AI. "Conviction from our purchasing contacts is very high," the analysts said, adding "we see more room to run." Many of the S&P 500's top performers this year are companies that make data storage or memory products needed to support AI data centers, like Micron, and stand to benefit from the same tailwinds. Micron, which counts leading AI chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) among its partners, last month posted record quarterly sales, thanks in large part to growth from its data center business. AMD announced a massive deal on Monday with OpenAI that sent its stock soaring nearly 30% in recent trading. The news also helped lift shares of partner stocks like Micron and Astera Labs (ALAB), which saw its stock jump 11%.

Title: Grayscale adds staking feature to Ethereum, Solana ETF products – Details!
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/grayscale-adds-staking-feature-to-ethereum-solana-etf-products-details/
Time Published: 2025-10-06T17:15:35Z
Full Content:
An update like this could open multiple possibilities for crypto products in the United States. Grayscale’s ETHE, ETH, and GSOL. Move will broaden investor access to on-chain rewards, while introducing yield-bearing crypto exposure to investors. On 6 October, Grayscale Investments, one of the world’s largest digital asset investment platforms, introduced staking for its Ethereum and Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) products — A move that marks a first for the U.S Crypto ETF market. The company announced that Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE), Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH), and Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL) have become the first U.S.-listed spot crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) to enable staking. The update allows investors to gain exposure not only to the spot prices of Ether and Solana, but also to the networks’ staking rewards — Traditionally earned by users who lock their tokens directly on-chain. According to Peter Mintzberg, Grayscale’s CEO, “Staking in our spot Ethereum and Solana funds is exactly the kind of first-mover innovation Grayscale was built to deliver.” Grayscale will stake its ETH and SOL ETF holdings through institutional custodians and a diversified network of validator providers. The process will be passive, meaning investors do not need to hold crypto or manage validators themselves. Instead, the funds will earn staking rewards, which are then expected to remain within the fund, potentially enhancing its net asset value (NAV) over time. The ETHE fund is Grayscale’s flagship Ethereum product, designed primarily for institutional and long-term investors. On the contrary, the ETH Mini Trust offers a lower-fee, retail-friendly version. According to data from Sosovale, ETHE is the second-largest Ethereum ETF, valued at $4.82 billion. ETH Mini Trust ranks fourth, valued at $3.31 billion. Source: Sosovalue The GSOL trust, currently traded over the counter, has also activated staking and could become one of the first Solana Spot ETPs with staking if its exchange listing is approved. Until now, U.S Spot crypto ETFs have provided exposure only to the underlying asset’s price. By enabling staking, Grayscale has effectively introduced yield-bearing crypto exposure into traditional finance – A feature that could pressure competitors like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark to follow suit. The move will also broaden investor access to on-chain rewards, eliminating the technical risks associated with self-custody, validator management, and slashing penalties. For long-term holders, it would introduce an additional return component that mirrors the yield mechanics found in decentralized finance (DeFi). The addition of staking is notable given the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s cautious position on yield-generating crypto products. Grayscale’s structure — where staking rewards remain within the fund rather than distributed — may have been key to regulatory acceptance. Grayscale’s latest move could redefine how investors interact with crypto, bridging the gap between DeFi and Wall Street.

LG Electronics India Ltd. has raised nearly Rs 3,475 crore from anchor investors on Monday, ahead of its initial public offering. The company allotted 3.04 crore shares at Rs 1,140 apiece to 149 anchor investors. SBI Large & Midcap Fund got the highest allocation of 4.6%, followed by INQ Holding LLC at 3.9%, Government Of Singapore at 3.4%, and Government Pension Fund Global at 3%. Marquee investors including Goldman Sachs and Blackrock Global Funds also bagged shares of the issue. A total of 26 domestic mutual funds applied through 84 schemes, the electronics firm said in an exchange filing on Monday. They have collectively netted 48.9% of the anchor portion. These include mutual funds from the likes of SBI, Axis, Kotak Mahindra, HDFC, Nippon, Bandhan, Aditya Birla, Edelweiss, HSBC, and more. Morgan Stanley India Co., JPMorgan India Pvt., Axis Capital Ltd., BofA Securities India Ltd. and Citigroup Global Markets India Pvt. are the bankers for the IPO. The company is set to launch its initial public offering on Oct. 7 with the issue closing on Oct. 9 according to the company’s red herring prospectus. The IPO will only comprise offer for sale of up to 10.18 crore equity shares. The price band for the issue is set at Rs 1,080-1,140 per share. Through the IPO, the South Korean parent — LG Electronics Inc. — will offload 10.2 crore shares. LG Electronics India operates in two key segments: home appliances and air solutions and home entertainment. It has firmly established itself as the market leader in major home appliances and consumer electronics, excluding mobile phones. The company holds the top position in India across product categories such as washing machines, refrigerators, panel TVs, inverter air conditioners, and microwaves as per the value market share in the offline channel, stated the draft red herring prospectus. This dual focus on high-demand product categories and offline market strength has positioned LG as a go-to brand for Indian consumers. While the company made a profit of Rs 1,511 crore in the fiscal 2024, it paid a much more liberal dividend of Rs 2,093 crore at Rs 185 per share. In the first quarter of the current fiscal, the company reported a revenue of Rs 6,409 crore and a profit of Rs 680 crore. Operating income stood at Rs 958 crore and its margin against the top line came up to 14.94%.

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed in recent trading, as tech sector gains helped lift the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher to start the week, while a slide in shares of Verizon (VZ) weighed on the Dow. Verizon Communications (VZ) was the worst-performing stock on the Dow and among the biggest decliners in the S&P 500 after the telecom company announced former PayPal (PYPL) CEO Dan Schulman would take over as its new CEO. Shares of International Paper (IP) and Smurfit Westrock (SW) also dropped as British rival Mondi warned challenging market conditions would hurt profits. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500, adding nearly 30% to hover around their closing record, after the chipmaker announced a deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI that could have the AI startup take a 10% stake in AMD. Tesla (TSLA) stock climbed after the EV maker teased a Tuesday event that analysts think could bring a lower-cost model. Critical Metals (CRML) shares soared following a report the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in the rare earth minerals miner. Comerica (CMA) shares also jumped after Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) agreed to buy the financial firm in an all-stock deal valued at $10.9 billion. The price of gold hit an all-time high, and oil prices rose after OPEC and its allies agreed to a modest production increase. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose. The U.S. dollar gained on the euro, pound, and yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded higher, after Bitcoin reached a record high over the weekend.

Grayscale has introduced this functionality to its Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE), the second-largest such fund on Wall Street with assets of $4.82 billion, as well as its Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH). The firm, which filed its staking addendum with the SEC on Monday, will rely on institutional custodians like Coinbase and a “diversified network of validator providers” to stake its Ethereum. Staking has also been activated within the Grayscale Solana Trust, which is awaiting regulatory approval to be turned into an ETF. The move is a significant development, given that institutional investors have only been able to capitalize on ETH's price gains until now. Ethereum made an ambitious upgrade to a proof-of-stake blockchain in 2022, meaning validators voluntarily lock ETH away and receive rewards for taking a role in securing the network. It’s a much less energy-intensive approach than the previous proof-of-work consensus model, which Bitcoin and some other chains still use. Grayscale’s Ethereum exchange-traded products were among the first to hit the traditional financial market, with its trust-style product ETHE dating back to 2017. Last year, after Ethereum spot ETFs gained SEC approval, the firm successfully converted its products into spot Ethereum ETFs in July. The absence of staking rewards in ETFs have been cited as a key factor in the slower adoption of Ethereum funds since they launched in the summer of 2024. Data from SoSoValue shows the total net assets in Bitcoin ETFs currently stands at $164.5 billion—equivalent to 6.7% of its market capitalization. Ethereum ETFs lag behind with net assets of $30.5 billion, 5.6% of this cryptocurrency's valuation. However, demand has been growing in recent months—driven by ETH's outperformance in the crypto market. Ethereum has surged by 156% over the past six months, compared with BTC's gains of about 50%, and set a new all-time high price mark shy of $5,000 in September. In a statement, Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg said staking was "exactly the kind of first-mover innovation" that the company was designed to deliver. “As the #1 digital asset-focused ETF issuer in the world by AUM, we believe our trusted and scaled platform uniquely positions us to turn new opportunities like staking into tangible value potential for investors," he added. Grayscale says it plans to roll out staking to more of its products "as the digital asset ecosystem evolves." The unique selling point could help Grayscale close the gap with BlackRock, whose Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs dominate the market. Crypto exchange-traded products just capped off a record week, pulling in a total of $5.95 billion worth of investments last week, according to CoinShares. That tally included $1.48 billion worth of inflows into Ethereum funds, with both Bitcoin and ETH funds rebounding after being in the red the previous week.

The chipmaker granted OpenAI a warrant for up to a 10% stake, tightly aligning their success. This massive agreement cements AMD as a core partner in OpenAI’s infrastructure plan. The battle for supremacy in the AI chip market just reached a critical new phase. In a move that sent its stock soaring, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced a major multi-year partnership with OpenAI. The deal has the potential to fundamentally reshape the industry’s supply chain. OpenAI, which is racing to build the immense computing power needed for the next generation of artificial intelligence, has committed to deploying an astonishing 6 gigawatts (GW) of AMD Instinct GPUs. This agreement is far more than a simple hardware purchase. It represents one of the largest GPU deployment contracts in AI history and serves as a powerful endorsement of AMD’s accelerator technology. In exchange for this massive, multi-year commitment, AMD has granted OpenAI a warrant to acquire up to 160 million shares. This could eventually translate to a roughly 10% stake in the chipmaker. The unconventional arrangement aims to tie the success of the two companies together. The vesting of the shares is directly linked to OpenAI hitting deployment milestones—starting with the initial 1 GW rollout of AMD’s MI450 series chips in late 2026—and the continued increase in AMD’s share price. AMD CEO Lisa Su noted that this incentive motivates OpenAI to ensure the successful integration of AMD’s hardware, turning the customer into a strategic partner invested in the chipmaker’s long-term success. The sheer scale of this deployment reflects the AI industry’s relentless demand for computing power. This 6 GW commitment to AMD, combined with OpenAI’s prior agreements with other vendors (including a major 10 GW infrastructure deal with Nvidia), confirms that the AI startup is proceeding with a multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure roadmap. For AMD, this partnership is a turning point. The firm expects the agreement to net tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue. It also forecasts that the ripple effect will generate over $100 billion in new revenue from OpenAI and subsequent customers over the next four years. Nvidia still commands the lion’s share of the market, though. However, this deal firmly establishes AMD as a serious player capable of supplying the advanced computing technology needed for AI’s hyperscale future. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines.

Title: PLUME Rises 25% as Network Registered by SEC as Transfer Agent for Tokenized Securities
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/06/plume-network-registered-by-sec-as-transfer-agent-for-tokenized-securities
Time Published: 2025-10-06T15:00:22Z
Full Content:
Plume Network, a modular Layer 2 blockchain dedicated to real-world assets (RWAs), is now an SEC-regulated transfer agent, streamlining the issuance, transfer, and management of tokenized securities. The network's native token (PLUME) rose by 25% following the announcement as daily trading volume rose by 186%, according to CoinMarketCap. As a registered transfer agent, Plume will now manage digital securities and shareholder records directly onchain, supporting interoperability with the U.S. Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) settlement network, according to the press release shared with CoinDesk. Further, it will facilitate a range of use cases, including onchain IPOs, small-cap fundraising, and registered funds. Most notably, the technology aims to reduce tokenization timelines from months to mere weeks via smart-contract automation. Plume's registration provides a much-needed regulatory infrastructure for institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity and Apollo seeking compliant on-chain asset transfers. "At Plume, we believe transfer agent regulation exists to protect investors’ rights as shareholders. With this fully onchain transfer agent protocol, we are streamlining the issuance of digital securities with a built-in partnership with regulators,” said Chris Yin, CEO and Co-Founder of Plume. "The crypto industry has been searching for a viable bridge between DeFi’s speed and TradFi’s safeguards. With the issuance of this license places Plume as the ideal solution for this search," Yin added. A transfer agent in the traditional sense is a financial institution that maintains official records of a company's shareholders, manages ownership changes, issues stock certificates, and handles dividend and interest payments. A blockchain transfer agent, such as Plume, performs similar functions on-chain by leveraging distributed ledger technology, offering a secure, immutable and transparent digital record of asset ownership and transfers. Plume’s achievement comes after its active collaboration with regulatory bodies, including its contributions to discussions surrounding the GENIUS Act. The announcement follows SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce’s remarks last week expressing the regulator’s openness to engaging with issuers of real-world asset tokenization projects. Plume's regulated transfer agent is operational, which allows interested funds to engage with Plume’s infrastructure with immediate effect, even as broader regulatory frameworks continue to evolve. Building on this foundation, Plume plans to launch its initial product offerings, involving Nest protocol vaults, in the first quarter of 2026. Within Plume Network, Nest is one of the significant protocols focused on staking mechanisms for real-world asset (RWA) protocols. Nest allows fund managers to create vaults backed by regulated financial instruments. Users can then deposit stablecoins into these vaults to earn yield in a permissionless way from the underlying real-world assets. Plume said that it has already garnered interest from SEC-registered investment funds (40 Act funds). And while regulatory challenges, such as asset custody issues, present hurdles, the company anticipates these will diminish as the SEC proposes new rules through 2026 and finalizes them by 2027. The 40 Act funds are publicly offered, pooled investment vehicles, such as open-end mutual funds, closed-end funds and unit investment trusts, registered under the Investment Act of 1940. The timing aligns with a broader market shift toward onchain securities and positions Plume at the forefront of this transition. "The license enables Plume to support the migration of offchain securities into compliant digital forms, especially 40 Act funds—the traditional backbone of the U.S. asset management industry representing over $39 trillion," the firm told CoinDesk. Plume is also seeking additional licenses, including Alternative Trading System (ATS) and broker-dealer registrations, to develop a fully compliant onchain capital market infrastructure for 40 ACT funds.

OpenAI and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have reached a groundbreaking deal that could see Sam Altman’s company take a 10 percent stake in the chipmaker. The deal comes shortly after OpenAI signed a massive deal with Nvidia, the dominant player in the AI chip arena. CNBC reports that the partnership, which was announced on Monday, has caused AMD stock to skyrocket by more than 28 percent in morning trading. Under the terms of the agreement, OpenAI will deploy six gigawatts of AMD’s Instinct graphics processing units (GPUs) over multiple years and across multiple generations of hardware. The rollout will commence with an initial 1-gigawatt deployment of chips in the second half of 2026. As part of the deal, AMD has issued OpenAI a warrant for up to 160 million shares of AMD common stock. The vesting of these shares is tied to both deployment volume and AMD’s share price milestones. The first tranche will vest upon the first full gigawatt deployment, with additional tranches unlocking as OpenAI scales up to six gigawatts and meets key technical and commercial milestones required for large-scale rollout. If OpenAI exercises the full warrant, it could acquire approximately 10 percent ownership in AMD, based on the current number of outstanding shares. While the exact dollar amount of the deal was not disclosed, OpenAI stated that it was worth billions. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, praised the partnership, stating, “AMD’s leadership in high-performance chips will enable us to accelerate progress and bring the benefits of advanced AI to everyone faster.” The deal positions AMD as a core strategic partner to OpenAI, marking one of the largest GPU deployment agreements in the artificial intelligence industry to date. The partnership is expected to help ease industrywide pressure on supply chains and reduce OpenAI’s reliance on a single vendor, but is likely to rub AI hardware giant Nvidia the wrong way. Breitbart News previously reported that OpenAI and Nvidia signed a massive $100 billion equity-and-supply agreement: Nvidia has unveiled plans to invest a staggering $100 billion in OpenAI, the AI company behind ChatGPT. The announcement sent shockwaves through the global chip sector, with companies linked to Nvidia experiencing a notable boost in their share prices. According to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, the deal between the two tech giants is set to be on an unprecedented scale. OpenAI intends to construct and deploy Nvidia systems that will require 10 gigawatts of power, equivalent to the output of between four and five million graphics processing units (GPUs). In a blog post, Nvidia calls the deal “the Biggest AI Infrastructure Deployment in History:” Shares of Nvidia fell more than one percent on Monday morning trading following the news of the OpenAI-AMD deal. OpenAI is also in talks with Broadcom to build custom chips for its next generation of models. For AMD, the partnership is both a commercial milestone and a validation of its next-generation Instinct roadmap. After years of trailing Nvidia in the AI accelerator market, AMD now has a flagship customer at the forefront of the generative AI boom. AMD CEO Lisa Su said the deal creates “a true win-win enabling the world’s most ambitious AI buildout and advancing the entire AI ecosystem.” Read more at CNBC here.

Δ The collaboration will see the companies develop artificial intelligence data centers running on AMD processors, according to a Monday (Oct. 6) press release. “This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realize AI’s full potential,” OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman said in the release. “AMD’s leadership in high-performance chips will enable us to accelerate progress and bring the benefits of advanced AI to everyone faster.” With this deal, OpenAI pledged to purchase 6 gigawatts worth of AMD’s chips, beginning with the MI450 chip next year, the release said. It will buy the chips either directly or through OpenAI’s cloud computing partners, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Monday. As part of the agreement, AMD issued OpenAI a warrant for up to 160 million shares of AMD common stock, designed to vest as specific milestones are reached, according to the release. The first tranche vests with the initial 1-gigawatt MI450 chip deployment, with more tranches vesting as purchases scale up to 6 gigawatts. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue “Vesting is further tied to AMD achieving certain share-price targets and to OpenAI achieving the technical and commercial milestones required to enable AMD deployments at scale,” the release said. The deal comes on the heels of chipmaker Nvidia’s $100 billion pledge to OpenAI, a deal that, when realized, would be the largest private company investment on record. AMD CEO Lisa Su said the deal will result in tens of billions of dollars in new revenue for the chip company over the next half-decade, per the WSJ report. She was interviewed jointly with Altman, who said demand for inference computing has jumped in tandem with the rise of AI tools like large language models. “It’s hard to overstate how difficult it’s become” to get sufficient computing power, Altman said, according to the report. “We want it super fast, but it takes some time.” Inference is when a trained model is applied to new inputs in real time, a “constant, real-time activity” that never stops, PYMNTS reported Sept. 22. Keeping ChatGPT online alone reportedly costs OpenAI tens of millions of dollars each month. Altman and Su said their collaboration gives both companies incentives to commit to the boom in AI infrastructure, WSJ reported. “It’s a win for both of our companies, and I’m glad that OpenAI’s incentives are tied to AMD’s success and vice-versa,” Su said, per the report.

Title: US shutdown and weak jobs data drive record $6B crypto inflows

Investors turn to digital assets as US government shutdown and weak jobs data raise fiscal stability doubts. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. A US government shutdown and the weak jobs report have pushed digital asset investment products to their strongest weekly inflows on record. According to the latest CoinShares report, crypto-related investment products attracted $5.95 billion in inflows last week, pushing total assets under management (AUM) to an all-time peak of $245 billion. The rally did not emerge from retail excitement or online speculation. Instead, it stemmed from macroeconomic unease following the US government shutdown and disappointing employment data. Investors appeared to interpret both as warning signs about the country’s fiscal resilience and the Federal Reserve’s policy direction. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, explained that the inflows reflected a delayed investor reaction to the Federal Open Market Committee’s recent rate cut and current US government events. According to him: “We believe this was due to a delayed response to the FOMC interest rate cut, compounded by very weak employment data, as indicated by Wednesday’s ADP Payroll release, and concerns over US government stability following the shutdown.” This resulted in a wave of capital seeking refuge in assets perceived as both liquid and resilient. The CoinShares report suggested that investors appear to be treating digital assets not as speculative plays but as macro hedge instruments that respond to fiscal turbulence and liquidity shifts. As expected, Bitcoin absorbed most of last week’s inflows, capturing a record $3.55 billion in fresh capital. This is its strongest week in history. Notably, the 12 US-based Bitcoin ETF providers, including BlackRock, accounted for roughly $3.2 billion of that total, which is their second-strongest weekly performance since launch last year. Conversely, short Bitcoin products saw no flows for the week, signaling renewed investor confidence as prices approach new highs. BTC price reached a new all-time high of more than $125,000 during the weekend. This move highlights Bitcoin’s enduring role as the market’s liquidity anchor and a preferred hedge in uncertain times. Ethereum also turned a corner during the period. After weeks of redemptions, the asset drew $1.48 billion in new capital, lifting its year-to-date total to $13.7 billion. Notably, this is nearly triple its total inflows for last year. At the same time, Solana-focused funds hit an all-time high of $706.5 million, pushing their 2025 tally to $2.85 billion, while XRP saw $219.4 million amid anticipation of new spot investment products. These inflows show that crypto markets are no longer reacting to hype but to macro signals, including liquidity trends, rate policy, and institutional sentiment.

Title: Grayscale Becomes First to Add Staking to US Spot Ethereum ETFs
URL: https://www.coinspeaker.com/grayscale-becomes-first-to-add-staking-to-us-spot-ethereum-etfs/
Time Published: 2025-10-06T13:34:40Z

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Grayscale introduced staking for its US-listed spot Ethereum ETFs, ETHE and ETH, in a first-of-its-kind development in the US market. Digital asset manager Grayscale Assets Management announced its plans to introduce staking for its existing spot Ethereum ETFs. This is the first of its kind development in Ethereum ETFs, and comes despite the ongoing US shutdown. ETH $4 480 24h volatility: 4.4% Market cap: $540.77 B Vol. 24h: $50.88 B price is showing strength once again as it approaches the $4,600 mark. In a significant and first move in the crypto space, digital asset manager Grayscale announced the launch of a staking facility for its US-listed spot Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH). The latest decision comes as the Ethereum price bounces back and is eyeing a breakout to new all-time highs. With these staking features, Grayscale aims to provide investors with exposure to the long-term value growth of the Ethereum network. At the same time, it will preserve the funds’ primary objectives, with ETHE and ETH providing spot Ether exposure. Grayscale noted that ETHE and ETH are not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and are therefore not subject to the same regulations or protections as 40 Act-registered ETFs and mutual funds. On the other hand, other Ethereum ETFs from US issuers, such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest, still need to obtain SEC approval for the staking feature. This is a crucial decision as introducing staking will further amplify the yields for investors, driving greater institutional inflows. In addition to Ethereum ETFs, Grayscale has also introduced staking to its Solana Trust (GSOL). This will provide investors with a traditional brokerage route to earn SOL $221.8 24h volatility: 4.6% Market cap: $121.15 B Vol. 24h: $9.58 B staking rewards. The firm has filed with the U.S. SEC to convert GSOL into an ETF under the 1933 Act. However, this is not the first Solana staking ETF currently available on the market. The REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF (SSK), which is regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, has recently begun trading. It offers direct spot SOL exposure alongside rewards generated from on-chain staking. Since its launch in July, the Rex Osprey Solana staking ETF has grown its assets under management to $404 million. The decision comes at a time when the cryptocurrency market is navigating the ongoing US government shutdown. Market analysts believe that this could further delay the decision for several crypto ETFs, scheduled for October.

Kieran Quilligan's body was found five months after he went missing. Niall Long (left) and Luke Taylor (right). Photo: Provision. Two men have denied the murder of Kieran Quilligan (47). Niall Long (33) and Luke Taylor (27) appeared before the Central Criminal Court, sitting in Cork, charged with the murder of Mr Quilligan. Both defendants are charged with the murder of Mr Quilligan on a date unknown between September 1, 2023, and January 29, 2024, at an unknown location within the State. The charge is brought contrary to Common Law. Niall Long (left) and Luke Taylor (right). Photo: Provision. The two men entered not guilty pleas when arraigned before Ms Justice Siobhan Lankford and a jury of ten men and two women at Cork Courthouse, Angelsea Street. Long is formerly of St Michael's Close, Mahon, Cork Taylor is of no fixed abode and previously of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork. Both men only spoke during the hearing to confirm their not guilty pleas. Ms Justice Lankford was told by Donal O'Sullivan SC, for the State, that the case is expected to be quite lengthy and could last for between three and four weeks. Jurors were told they need to be available for the case until at least October 28. The hearing could feature up to 126 witnesses including Gardaí and householders as well as forensic, technical and medical personnel. It will also involve a substantial amount of CCTV security camera footage. Mr Long is represented by Ray Boland SC while Mr Taylor is represented by Brendan Grehan SC. Both defendants had previously been granted free legal aid. The jury was informed that the case will be formally opened by Mr O'Sullivan on Wednesday. No details of the case beyond the charge were outlined in court. Mr Quilligan was the focus of a major Garda missing person investigation from September 2023 when he was last seen in public in Cork city. His body was discovered almost five months later. Gardaí launched a murder investigation following the discovery of Mr Quilligan's remains and on receipt of the findings of a post mortem examination. Mr Quilligan was 5’7" in height, of medium build and with brown/grey hair and blue eyes. He also had a large and distinctive tattoo on the side of his head.

Title: Bitcoin Spot ETFs’ Rising Strength Challenges Dominance Of Spot Market Trading, A Pivotal Shift Ahead?

Full Content:
As the price of Bitcoin pushes near its all-time high, several areas involving the crypto king, especially the Spot ETFs, are starting to turn remarkably green once again. With the Spot ETFs recording bullish closes, this renewed momentum is beginning to challenge the spot market trading. The historic Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are returning to their bullish state as the market recovers. A recent research by Darkfost, a market expert and CryptoQuant author, shows that BTC spot ETFs are quickly gaining traction in the cryptocurrency investment market. While gaining serious traction, the BTC spot ETFs appear to be challenging and heavily drawing attention away from direct spot market trading. Such development implies that these products may be becoming the ideal gateway between traditional finance and digital assets due to their regulated accessibility, institutional confidence, and increasing inflows. According to the expert, the market is currently in a period where ETFs are becoming increasingly popular compared to the spot market. This is changing the way that institutional and individual investors are exposed to Bitcoin, indicating a fundamental shift in the dynamics of the market. When examining trading volumes, without taking into account derivatives, the spot market continues to dominate by a wide margin. However, it is clearly evident that ETF volumes are growing substantially. As a result, Darkfost believes it is highly relevant to monitor the ETF flows in those days. Generally, volumes have ranged between $1 billion and $2.5 billion between May 2024 and November 2024, excluding the initial launch period of spot BTC ETFs. Meanwhile, these days, they are more in the range between $2.5 billion and $5 billion. Darkfost highlighted that this increase in volume is probably due to the robust expansion of Bitcoin spot ETFs, especially in the United States. With this growth, ETF volumes are already catching up to spot volumes, which might signal the start of a paradigm shift if the trend keeps getting stronger. In the midst of this paradigm shift, the expert stated that ETFs have made cryptocurrency more accessible to a wider range of investors, particularly in the US. While ETFs may have taken away liquidity from the spot market, the funds have also absorbed a sizable portion of Bitcoin. As ETFs are also well-structured instruments for institutional investors, these BTCs are still being traded like any other crypto asset, but under a different framework. Another crucial aspect highlighted by Darkfost is that these BTC holdings become less reactive. This development is driven by the fact that supply is currently controlled by large asset management companies such as BlackRock and Fidelity. Instead of using Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) or market panic, these companies manage based on supply and demand dynamics. In the meantime, Darkfost noted that all of this supports the notion that there is a significant shift taking place in the Bitcoin market. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Profile news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time SAN FRANCISCO — AMD said on Monday it will supply artificial intelligence chips to OpenAI in a multi-year deal that would bring in tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue and give the ChatGPT creator the option to buy up to roughly 10% of the chipmaker. The deal offers OpenAI an opportunity to take a stake in one of Nvidia’s most formidable rivals and is a powerful endorsement of Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD’s) AI chips and software. “We view this deal as certainly transformative, not just for AMD, but for the dynamics of the industry,” AMD executive vice president Forrest Norrod told Reuters on Sunday. The agreement covers the deployment of hundreds of thousands of AMD’s AI chips, or graphics processing units (GPUs), equivalent to six gigawatts, over several years beginning in the second half of 2026. AMD said OpenAI would build a one-gigawatt facility based on its forthcoming MI450 series of chips beginning next year, and that it would begin to recognize revenue then. AMD executives expect the deal to net tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue. Because of the ripple effect of the agreement, AMD expects to receive more than $100 billion in new revenue over four years from OpenAI and other customers, they said. “Other people are going to come along with it because this is really the pioneer, a pioneer in the industry that has a lot of influence over the broader ecosystem,” AMD strategy chief Mat Hein said. The deal with AMD will help OpenAI build enough AI infrastructure to meet its needs, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimate AMD will generate revenue of $32.78 billion this year, according to LSEG data. As part of the arrangement, AMD issued a warrant that gives OpenAI the ability to buy up to 160 million shares of AMD for 1 cent each over the course of the chips deal. The warrant vests in tranches based on milestones that the two companies have agreed on. The first tranche will vest after the initial shipment of MI450 chips set for the second half of 2026. The remaining milestones include specific AMD stock price targets that escalate to $600 a share for the final installment of stock to unlock. AMD has 1.62 billion shares outstanding and is valued at $267.23 billion, according to LSEG data. Its shares closed on Friday at $164.67. OpenAI has a valuation of $500 billion. OpenAI has worked with AMD for years, providing inputs on the design of older generations of AI chips such as the MI300X. The San Francisco-based AI company has been taking a number of steps to ensure it has the chips needed for its future needs. In September, Nvidia announced an investment of up to $100 billion in OpenAI that included a plan to supply at least 10 gigawatts worth of Nvidia systems. The plan includes OpenAI deploying a gigawatt of Nvidia’s next-generation Vera Rubin chips in late 2026. In addition to using Nvidia hardware, cloud computing giants such as Alphabet’s Google and Amazon build their own in-house processors. Similarly, OpenAI is in the process of developing its own silicon for AI use and has partnered with Broadcom, Reuters reported last year. OpenAI and its main backer Microsoft also announced last month that they had signed a non-binding agreement to restructure OpenAI into a for-profit entity, signaling further changes in the governance of the fast-growing AI company. A person familiar with the matter said the deal with AMD does not change any of OpenAI’s ongoing compute plans, including that effort or its partnership with Microsoft. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Shares of AI chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices are in the spotlight on Monday, after the company announced a multibillion-dollar partnership with Sam Altman's OpenAI to collaborate on artificial intelligence data centres. AMD's stock price surged a sharp 31% to $215.62 on the back of this development, as of 7:20 p.m. IST. The deal could see Altman acquire a 10% stake in the chipmaker, which may prove to be one of the most direct challenges to industry leader Nvidia. Nvidia's premarket share price was trading marginally in the red at the same hour. OpenAI plans to deploy six gigawatts of AMD's Instinct GPUs over several years and across multiple hardware generations, the companies announced. The partnership will begin with a 1-gigawatt deployment in the second half of 2026. As part of the deal, AMD has issued OpenAI a warrant to purchase up to 160 million shares of its common stock. The first tranche will vest upon completion of the initial 1-gigawatt rollout, with additional tranches unlocking as OpenAI scales to six gigawatts and hits key technical and commercial milestones necessary for large-scale deployment. If fully exercised, the warrant would give OpenAI roughly a 10% stake in AMD, based on the chipmaker's current number of outstanding shares. "AMD's leadership in high-performance chips will enable us to accelerate progress and bring the benefits of advanced AI to everyone faster," OpenAI CEO Altman said in a statement announcing the agreement. The deal positions AMD as a key strategic partner for OpenAI and represents one of the largest GPU procurement agreements in the AI industry to date. The move comes just two weeks after OpenAI finalised a landmark $100 billion equity-and-supply agreement with Nvidia. In contrast to the AMD arrangement, that deal saw Nvidia taking an ownership stake in OpenAI. "This is a true win-win enabling the world's most ambitious AI buildout and advancing the entire AI ecosystem," AMD CEO Lisa Su said.

Title: It’s Time for Soft Secession

Clara JefferyNovember+December 2025 Issue Edmon de Haro Edmon de Haro In 2013, venture capitalist Tim Draper launched a “Six Californias” ballot initiative. The upshot was that with some 40 million people, more than the population of the 20 smallest states combined, California was too big, too diverse, to be “efficiently” governed. So why not, Draper argued, break it up into six new “startups,” a.k.a. states? Instead of two senators, we erstwhile “Californians” would get 12. Draper’s scheme was part of a long tradition—since California was admitted to the Union as part of the Compromise of 1850, there have been more than 220 proposals for it to divide or secede—but derided as a Silicon Valley ploy to create a libertarian deregulation zone. (Tellingly, the Bay Area state was to be named “Silicon Valley.”) And aside from the feasibility of making it happen, state and federal constitution-wise, people worried that it would cleave four rich populous states from two poorer rural states (fair) and weaken Democrats’ voting share in the Senate (in retrospect, nah). Draper’s measure gleaned valid signatures from some 753,000 people—more, it must be said, than the populations of America’s three smallest states—but in California, that wasn’t enough to get on the ballot. After the 2016 election, which put the anti-majoritarian provisions of the US Constitution very much front of mind, Draper came back with a simpler proposal—three Californias, or Cal 3. This initiative got enough signatures to head to voters, but the day before the 2018 ballots were to be printed, the state Supreme Court blocked the measure—what about things like existing water treaties, the justices worried—and Draper eventually gave up. While his motives were murky, Draper tapped into something now excruciatingly felt. The assignment of two senators per state, no matter its population, was always a deeply flawed (and deeply racist) proposition. But the unfairness has only gotten more acute. As my colleague Ari Berman has noted: “In 1790, the country’s most populous state, Virginia, had 12 times as many people as its least populous, Delaware. Today, California has 67 times the population of Wyoming. Fifteen small states with 41 million people combined now routinely elect 30 GOP senators; California, with 39 million residents, is represented by only two Democrats.” The Golden State is the fourth-largest economy in the world but doesn’t have political clout proportional to its population, let alone to our status as a global cultural, technological, and agricultural juggernaut. In case it’s not obvious why I’m taking a leisurely drive down a byroad of California electoral history, let’s review some of the abuses and usurpations that President Donald Trump has visited upon us. California, and the country, cannot await the outcome of the midterms to repel Trump’s siege on democracy. More drastic action is required. The most vicious of those abuses has been over immigration. On June 6, at the urging of his deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, ICE escalated raids in California, hitting farms, factories, construction sites, and schools, separating families and detaining undocumented people, legal residents, and even citizens. Federal agents arrested and hospitalized David Huerta, the head of one of the state’s most powerful unions. When protests erupted, Trump jumped at the chance to federalize the National Guard against Gov. Gavin Newsom’s wishes—something that hasn’t been done since LBJ acted to protect civil rights protesters from segregationists. Border czar Tom Homan threatened to arrest Newsom, which Trump agreed was a “great” idea. When a reporter asked for what crime, Trump responded that his “primary crime is running for governor” and called protesters “insurrectionists.” Speaker of the House Mike Johnson chimed in that Newsom should be “tarred and feathered.” Then Trump sent Marines into LA. When California Sen. Alex Padilla—who was voted for by more Americans than 18 GOP senators combined—tried to ask Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem questions at a press conference, federal officials knocked him down and cuffed him. One-quarter of California’s population are immigrants, and the continual attack on them—and anyone who is brown—is a moral injury that plays out in our streets and our feeds day after day after day. But the direct assaults on California are by no means limited to raids and those protesting raids. Trump has dragged his feet about providing federal aid to address the devastation of LA’s wildfires, saying he’d release it only if we pass a voter-ID law; taken our own National Guard off fire lines; and made bizarre claims about sending us water for the fires from the Pacific Northwest. He’s canceled our car efficiency and emissions rules, attacked our renewable energy plan, and zeroed out federal money for rooftop solar and high-speed rail. He’s revoked federal grants to UCLA over spurious charges of antisemitism, then gave the school a list of demands, including a $1 billion settlement and the end of ­gender-affirming care in its hospitals. Amid all of that came Trump’s demand that Texas engage in midcycle redistricting to give the GOP five extra congressional seats that he says it’s “entitled to.” Newsom, both legitimately enraged and sensing an opportunity to help his presidential ambitions, has rallied California Democrats to mount a ballot initiative to temporarily set aside its nonpartisan redistricting commission and draw congressional maps to counterbalance Texas’ scheme. We will vote on that initiative in November, and my bet is it will pass. But California, and the country, cannot await the outcome of the midterms to repel Trump’s siege on democracy. More drastic action is required. Unfortunately, especially as Trump berates generals and admirals on “the enemy within” and suggests they use US cities as “training grounds,” it’s all too easy to imagine a world where the commanders of California’s military bases are compelled to choose sides. (If you think such scenarios are out of the realm of possibility, ask yourself why he and Pushup Pete Hegseth have been purging the brass.) Our boundaries of oceans and mountains and deserts, our copious natural resources, and our technological prowess make a return to an independent California Republic more feasible than it might be for other states. But in advance, and hopefully in lieu, of that, it’s time to start applying our economic muscle. When Trump first said he was gutting federal funding to California’s public universities, a system that is the envy of the world, Newsom responded: “Californians pay the bills for the federal government. We pay over $80 BILLION more in taxes than we get back. Maybe it’s time to cut that off, @realDonaldTrump.” Remember when Mitt Romney called 47 percent of Americans “takers,” layabouts who fed off the “makers” that he claimed to represent? (We do, since Mother Jones’ own David Corn broke that story, arguably changing the course of the 2012 election.) This persistent GOP talking point is especially odd when you consider the residents of 19 mostly blue states pay more to the US Treasury than they get in federal benefits; to Newsom’s point, none pays more than California. (This includes our undocumented residents, who pay billions in federal taxes and receive no federal benefits.) We’re mostly happy to do it because we believe in things like Social Security, public education, pandemic preparedness, and research institutions. But why should we sit by while you take our money, defund our priorities, and shit on our values? California can’t claim no power in Congress, like DC—home to 700,000 people, more than either Vermont or Wyoming—can. But it’s time to think outside of the electoral box and start flexing our considerable leverage. We are the nation’s largest agricultural state—growing more than a third of the country’s vegetables and ­three-quarters of its fruits—and the fifth-largest food producer in the world. We produce the most milk and the most wine, copious amounts of rice and cattle, and, crucially, 90 percent of US avocados. Other states may be poster children for farms, but we’re No. 1. Hollywood is a $47.2 billion industry exerting, for better or worse, immeasurable global cultural power. The $623 billion tech sector is even mightier. Were California to secede, almost 15 percent of America’s GDP would go with it, and the US could slip behind China as the world’s biggest economy. Short of actual secession, what could California do? It could learn from the Jimmy Kimmel showdown and lead a financial “countervalue” rebellion, using “the full weight of blue states’ market power, cultural influence and legal authority to raise the stakes of Republican red-state aggression,” Democratic strategists Arkadi Gerney and Sarah Knight wrote in the Washington Post, by imposing “regulatory and economic costs that bite hard enough to make the constituents of even the most insulated legislator feel the pain.” We could start by disinvesting our pension funds from red-state companies like AT&T, American Airlines, ExxonMobil, and Tesla. “The 15 blue trifectas (states where Democrats control the governor’s mansion and both houses of the state legislature), with their larger state budgets and more generous pensions, have state investments that total almost 75 percent more than the 23 red trifectas,” they note. If that seems a reach, consider that Texas effectively got BlackRock to drop its “woke” investment and governance policies by blackballing it. Blue states could lure away techies, doctors, nurses, and electricians with relocation bonuses. We could institute tax and other incentives to pull new factories and data centers away from red states. We could selectively terminate professional licensing reciprocity. We could ease commerce between friendly states and make it difficult for unfriendly ones. Economic retribution is just part of a broader constellation of tools that law professors Jessica Bulman-Pozen (Columbia) and Heather K. Gerken (Yale) call “uncooperative federalism” and others call “soft secession.” It’s not, writes Substacker Chris Armitage, “the violent rupture of 1861, but something else entirely. Blue states building parallel systems, withholding cooperation, and creating facts on the ground that render federal authority meaningless within their borders.” Some of this is already underway. Led by California’s Rob Bonta, the attorneys general of blue states have been having almost daily Zoom calls to plot strategy and file briefs and suits. Democratic governors have devoted tens of millions to hire lawyers for those fights and banded together to oppose Trump’s threats to send troops to their states. In early September, California, Oregon, and Washington created the West Coast Health Alliance to formulate their own vaccine standards and distribute shots, no matter what lunacy Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unleashes. Hawaii signed on a day later. Other blue states are honing similar coalitions. Unified action could further preserve what the federal government is destroying, law professors Aziz Z. Huq (University of Chicago) and Jon D. Michaels (UCLA) wrote in the Los Angeles Times. Blue states could create “large regional research consortia; re-create public-health and meteorology forecasting centers servicing member states; and finance pandemic planning.” (A proposal to do much of this is underway in Sacramento.) With the Justice Department doing little more than acting as Trump’s goon squad, states could also “mobilize interstate criminal task forces to track and prosecute corruption by politicians, ­lobbyists and government contractors (who invariably, when violating federal laws, run afoul of myriad state laws, too).” Ditto consumer and environmental investigations—the cost of which could be offset by fines, even as they lay the groundwork for federal prosecutions if America is ever restored to sanity. But we need to be clear-eyed: Such a restoration may not come in time. So far, this year has been marked by a collective action problem. Media conglomerates, law firms, universities, banks, CEOs—too many powerful institutions and individuals have failed to meet the moment. This is why people all over the country, desperate for pushback against Trump’s autocracy, have embraced Newsom’s redistricting plan, whatever their broader opinions of him. With Trump provocatively sending troops into blue cities, and using recision and the shutdown to claw back congressionally appropriated funds from blue states, it’s time to turn the tables on him. Soft secession, powered by the presidential ambitions of multiple blue-state governors, could, should it come to that, be the proving ground of a new confederacy. Hopefully the threat of CalExit or a new Union will be enough. But that extreme measures might be necessary to ensure that American democracy shall not perish from the Earth is becoming more self-evident with every passing day.

(Bloomberg) -- Som Seif, the entrepreneur bent on disrupting Canada’s financial industry, has found himself at the center of an unprecedented showdown with the country’s top markets watchdog. The asset management executive is a consummate marketer — a skill that helped him build a firm that was one of Canada’s early winners in exchange-traded funds, sell it to BlackRock Inc., then start another, Purpose Investments Inc. But that knack for self-promotion has caught the attention of the Ontario Securities Commission, which now alleges that Purpose made false or misleading statements about its use of environmental, social and governance factors in investment decisions. The regulator, in its first enforcement action against greenwashing, also went after Seif himself, saying he failed to stop the claims — and laid out potential penalties that would, at the extreme end, see him banned from being a senior executive in Ontario’s investment industry. Purpose, with about C$26 billion ($18.6 billion) of assets under management, is hardly a global player. But its founder has a public persona in Canada created through years of television appearances and in-flight ads, and that makes him a high-profile target. “There’s been a longstanding perception in industry that Canadian securities regulators as a whole are relatively weak on enforcement,” said Doug Sarro, a law professor at the University of Ottawa who previously worked at the OSC. With this filing, Sarro believes Ontario’s watchdog is trying to “deliver on their new head of enforcement’s vision of more impactful, high-visibility enforcement.” That head is Bonnie Lysyk, Ontario’s former auditor-general, who’s known for a bombshell report on a land development scandal that rattled the government of Premier Doug Ford. Several industry players expressed surprise that the commission went after Purpose, which voluntarily stopped making certain ESG claims in 2023. During the heyday of ESG fund releases between 2020 and 2022, sustainability expert Tim Nash said he saw marketing “throughout the industry that I felt was pushing the boundaries of greenwashing.” The founder of Toronto-based Good Investing said he welcomes enforcement in this realm, but “it does feel to me that there is a little bit of a target on Purpose.” “While this case is the first ESG-related enforcement action brought by the OSC, the issue at the heart of it relates to false and misleading statements,” the regulator said in an email. Seif and Purpose are contesting the claims, with their first hearing set for Monday. “We remain confident about our position and look forward to the proceedings,” Purpose said in a statement. True to form, Seif is also making his case to the court of public opinion in a video, saying the OSC is going after his firm for taking a “genuinely innovative” approach to ESG at a time when no regulatory guidelines existed. In an interview when the allegations were first unveiled, Seif argued the regulator is seeking to score political points, not protect investors. “A regulator is using their position for political greenwashing goals, as opposed to going after people who cause real investor harm.” ‘ESG Always’ Seif, an engineer by training who got his start in finance as an investment banker with Royal Bank of Canada, rose to prominence on Toronto’s Bay Street by building Claymore Investments Inc., one of Canada’s first standalone ETF providers. After Claymore was sold to BlackRock in 2012, Seif founded Purpose Investments. It’s now part of his broader firm, Purpose Unlimited Inc., which has received financial backing from the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System and the digital investments unit of Allianz SE. Seif has long advocated for innovation in the financial industry and beyond, and sits on the boards of Wealthsimple Inc. and an entrepreneurship charity. Purpose, meanwhile, launched Canada’s first physical Bitcoin, single-stock and high-interest-savings ETFs, and also has private-asset and retirement-focused products. What it doesn’t offer is standalone ESG funds. Instead, “we had the ambition of embedding ESG considerations as a factor across all of our investment processes,” Seif said in a video uploaded to LinkedIn after the OSC released its allegations — eliciting a supportive comment from a former senior securities regulator. Ontario’s securities regulator, however, says Purpose’s ambition was more about marketing than action. Its case takes issue with at least 19 statements that Purpose or its leader made about ESG between September 2019 and March 2022, including on Purpose’s website and in media interviews. For example, the company said one of its principles was “ESG Always” — a slogan it changed to “ESG Conscious” in 2023, following an OSC review. All but one of the 19 statements came before January 2022, when Canadian securities regulators published their first ESG-specific guidance. The regulator alleges that Purpose didn’t consider ESG in making investment decisions for many of its funds and didn’t even have a formal policy. Less than 35% of assets under management in 2019 considered ESG, the OSC added, despite Purpose saying the percentage was 75%. The watchdog included a range of potential remedies in its filing, from procedural changes to a permanent registration ban. Monetary penalties could be as high as C$5 million for each of five alleged violations. The regulator won’t necessarily seek all of those sanctions. “Once the merits of the case have been decided, the OSC will set out specifically what it is seeking to the Capital Markets Tribunal — and this will be informed by a number of considerations, including the Tribunal’s decision, reasons, and factual findings,” said spokesperson Andy McNair-West. Some securities lawyers say the maximum penalties look too severe for the nature of the infraction. “I don’t think most of it is proportionate,” said Amanda McLachlan, a partner with law firm Bennett Jones in Toronto. Cases in which Canadian regulators have permanently banned people from the capital markets include the Bridging Finance Inc. case, in which investors are estimated to have lost at least C$1 billion due to fraud, and the Sino-Forest Corp. scheme, when a Canadian-listed Chinese forestry company collapsed after it was found to have wildly misstated its assets. The OSC’s filing against Purpose doesn’t allege any investor losses. Enforcement Push The OSC’s action comes after the regulator “has had some high-profile decisions come out that have either not gone well for them or have been critical of enforcement efforts,” McLachlan said. In 2022, the OSC’s case against three former executives of CannTrust Holdings Inc. fell apart in the middle of a trial, resulting in an acquittal. In November, the Capital Markets Tribunal dismissed the OSC’s case against Cormark Securities Inc. and others regarding illegal distributions, calling the allegations an “overreach.” McLachlan said it shouldn’t be surprising that the OSC brought a greenwashing case, given that it completed 128 fund reviews across 41 managers between January 2022 and March 2024. Ambiguous ESG materials have led to multimillion-dollar fines in the US. Invesco Advisers Inc. agreed last November to pay $17.5 million to settle allegations that it misled clients about the share of companywide assets under management that integrated ESG factors into investment decisions. Under the Trump administration, however, the Securities and Exchange Commission moved to end climate-related reporting requirements, leading to a rollback of such rules worldwide. But while there may be less focus on climate and diversity, Canadian securities regulators have emphasized they’ll still go after misleading statements. Regardless of the outcome of the Purpose case, a regulator “is putting out there that they’re going to be reviewing disclosure very carefully,” said Barbara Hendrickson, managing partner of BAX Securities Law in Toronto, who previously worked at the OSC. “It sends a message to the market that they should clean up their existing disclosure if it doesn’t comply with the guidance.” --With assistance from Paula Sambo.

Title: Bitcoin Price Hits An All-Time High, But Here’s What Really Matters
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/10/06/bitcoin-price-hits-an-all-time-high-but-heres-what-really-matters/

ByDan Runkevicius, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin’s price just hit an all-time high at $124,688, pushing its market cap past $2.47 trillion. As Wall Street debates whether it’s a risk-on or risk-off asset, BlackRock says it’s something else entirely. Before we go any further, let’s get one thing out of the way. Bitcoin is not a currency in the way that the dollar or peso is and it is unlikely to ever become a currency in the way that some advocates imagine it to be. A decentralized means of exchange is a lovely democratic idea, but no government (left or right) seems to prefer a decentralized currency to run its books, which would reduce the government’s power over both monetary and fiscal policy. A good example is the Great Depression. In 1931, the U.S. experienced of the worst financial crisis in history. But, unlike today, the Fed’s hands were mostly tied. It couldn’t print more dollars to prop up the economy because the currency was linked to gold. So President Franklin Roosevelt passed Executive Order 6102, later dubbed the “Great Confiscation.” In short, it forced Americans to turn in their gold and sell it to the government at well below market rates. Banning bitcoin today would be a political walk in the park compared to the Great Confiscation and some measures that other governments have taken in the past, like the way that Argentina briefly restricted citizen bank accounts in 2001. That’s because a smaller percentage of the population owns bitcoin, even today, than owned gold or bank accounts in the previous examples. But that doesn’t mean bitcoin is worthless. Bitcoin doesn’t compete with paper money. It competes with insurance against paper money. So the real story behind bitcoin’s rise today isn’t the price but how quickly institutions are adopting it and how much it’s grown out of a speculative asset label into something of a “hedge.” Last month, BlackRock stopped just short of naming bitcoin a risk-off asset, calling it a unique “diversifier." First, bitcoin has a relatively low correlation with stocks. It has little to no exposure to the macro variables that drive traditional assets. And it’s well positioned for global monetary instability because it’s not tied to any jurisdiction. Perhaps more interestingly, bitcoin has risen in six out of six major global crises within 60 days since 2020 — more often, and at a much higher rate, than gold. “In most instances, including with the recent global market sell-off of April 2025, bitcoin has recovered back to its prior level within days or weeks, and in many cases has rallied further as a recognition of the positive potential impact of such disruptive events on bitcoin’s fundamentals begins to predominate,” wrote BlackRock analysts. So even if bitcoin never becomes a global reserve currency or daily transaction currency, it can still carry a lot of perceived value as a “unique diversifier,” "store of value," or a digital alternative to gold. After all, gold is not a legal tender (with few exceptions), you generally don’t buy anything with it. Gold’s industrial and jewelry applications make up just a sliver of demand. Yet private investors, institutions, and central banks still hold $26 trillion worth of it, just in case. And, as we see the price of bitcoin continuing to rise, some may argue that the same dynamic is unfolding with digital gold as well.

Title: Novice Investor’s Digest For Monday, October 6: Stock Prices Stay Strong On AI Enthusiasm

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. U.S. stock prices remained strong Friday on AI optimism and the expectation of lower interest rates later this year. The large-cap S&P 500 index rose slightly to close at a record high, the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite pulled back 0.3%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the blue-chip index, rose 0.5%, also hitting a new high. The U.S. government shutdown has not soured the stock market, even though the closure delayed an important jobs report due Friday. Other data due this week will likely be delayed also. Enthusiasm for AI’s future is commanding more attention than U.S. political leaders’ inability to compromise. In the last two weeks, Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL ) announced leadership changes to facilitate AI growth, OpenAI was valued at $500 billion, Hitachi partnered with OpenAI on a data center buildout and Fujitsu teamed with Nvidia (NVDA) to build AI robots. The AI frenzy still has legs, and it’s driving decisions at the world’s largest companies. Amid the deal-making, Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos shared his characterization of the environment—that while AI has real benefits, the technology is in “an industrial bubble” where good and bad ideas are getting funded. Bezos was speaking at Italian Tech Week. Stock futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones are up ahead of the market open on Monday. Contracts tied to the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones have gained 0.2%, while Nasdaq 100 futures are up 0.6%. Economic data coming from the federal government will be delayed due to the shutdown. Alcoholic beverage producer Constellation Brands (STZ) will report earnings after the market closes. Analysts expect STZ to report $3.41 EPS for the August quarter. The company’s EPS in the prior-year quarter was $4.32. Constellation Brands has fallen short of EPS expectations in two of the last three quarters. How does inflation affect your investments? The U.S. central bank, called the Fed, targets 2% inflation as the optimal rate for a healthy, growing economy. Inflation above 2% can create uncertainty, reduce consumer spending, put pressure on household and business budgets and shrink profits. Typically, the Fed addresses high inflation by raising interest rates, which can prompt more of the same: rising costs, lower spending and smaller profits. For these reasons, stock prices often grow more slowly or decline during periods of high inflation. But some companies fare better than others. Companies selling commodities or essential goods can do well in inflationary times. Commodities like oil, gas, precious metals and agricultural products become more valuable and can command higher prices under inflationary pressures. Essential goods have consistent demand—people keep buy toilet paper and toothpaste as prices rise. Essential goods with strong brand loyalty, like Charmin, do especially well, because their customers are less likely to switch to generic brands to save money. The other inflation consequence to consider is the drag on the value of your investment returns. Say your investments grow 10% at a time when inflation is 4%. You gained on the investments but lost on the inflation. Your net return can be approximated as 6%, or 10% less 4%. In investing lingo, the 10% is your nominal return and the 6% is your real return. Note that there is a more complicated real return formula that accounts for compounding, but the simple formula is adequate for estimates. Inflation can force a negative real return on assets that have appreciated or earned income. This is common for cash deposits and low-rate bonds. You could earn 1% in a traditional savings account while inflation is 2.9%, for example. In this scenario, the approximate net return is negative 1.9%. There are other benefits to holding cash, so investors commonly accept the potential for negative returns. The usual strategy is to offset negative cash returns by diversifying into higher-performing categories like stocks. Over the long-term, stocks outperform inflation.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks In a significant challenge to Nvidia’s dominance, OpenAI announced Monday it would buy 6 gigawatts of computing power from data centers that will run exclusively on AMD chips. Nvidia (NVDA) has become the go-to AI chipmaker in recent years, propelling it to a $4.6 trillion market capitalization that has made it the world’s most valuable public company. OpenAI, famous for its ChatGPT AI chatbot, is the artificial-intelligence frontrunner that just made waves when it launched the breakthrough video generator Sora 2. Just two weeks ago, the companies announced a $100 billion partnership, in which Nvidia agreed to start delivering chips in 2026. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a post on X that the company plans to increase its Nvidia purchasing and that the AMD partnership is “incremental” to its “work with Nvidia.” But AMD is no slouch, and demand for AI computing power is so high that OpenAI needed to hedge its bets. The deal will provide OpenAI with 1 gigawatt of power by this time next year and it will add another 5 gigawatts on future generations of AMD’s high-end Instinct processors. OpenAI will work with AMD (AMD) to build the technology, and it will invest significantly in AMD to fuel its chip-building capabilities. Shares of AMD jumped 36% in premarket trading on the news. Shares of Nvidia fell 2%. “With a 10% stake in AMD this quickly brings Lisa Su and AMD right into the core of the AI chip spending cycle and is a huge vote of confidence from OpenAI and Altman,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in an industry note Monday morning. The companies said the partnership would deliver tens of billions of dollars of revenue for AMD, but they didn’t disclose the exact amount of the deal. AMD issued OpenAI a warrant of 160 million shares of its stock, worth more than $26.3 billion at Friday’s closing price. Those shares would vest over time as the partnership achieves specific milestones, including share-price targets and overcoming technological hurdles for what Lisa Su, AMD’s CEO, called “the world’s most ambitious AI buildout.” “This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realize AI’s full potential,” Altman said in a statement. “AMD’s leadership in high-performance chips will enable us to accelerate progress and bring the benefits of advanced AI to everyone faster.” Su called the partnership a “win-win.” The amount of money getting thrown around the AI industry is staggering. In addition to the AMD and Nvidia deals, OpenAI agreed last month to pay Oracle $300 billion over five years for 4.5 gigawatts of data center space. And OpenAI is believed to have inked a $10 billion chip design deal with Broadcom to train its AI models, a move that could potentially reduce its reliance on partners like Nvidia and AMD. That’s why the AMD announcement may have been significant, but not exactly surprising — OpenAI has been diversifying its supply of chips for a while, notes Ben Barringer, global technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot. “AMD is another big player in this space, so this deal is a logical move from OpenAI and is great news for AMD,” said Barringer. It’s no surprise that the eight most valuable companies on the market are all heavily invested in AI — and all are worth more than $1.4 trillion. Following Nvidia are Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META), each of which announced new consumer-focused AI products in recent months. Broadcom, with a $1.6 trillion valuation, is No. 7 on the list. And Elon Musk’s Tesla, which has bet its future on AI-powered robotaxis and could soon make a large investment in Musk’s xAI company, is No. 8 on the list. Although those companies have driven enormous market gains over the past several years, many Wall Street analysts fear that the AI market has become a bubble — powered by unsustainable gains that are driven more by FOMO than fundamentals.

And OpenAI is believed to have inked a $10 billion chip design deal with Broadcom to train its AI models, a move that could potentially reduce its reliance on partners like Nvidia and AMD. That’s why the AMD announcement may have been significant, but not exactly surprising — OpenAI has been diversifying its supply of chips for a while, notes Ben Barringer, global technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot. “AMD is another big player in this space, so this deal is a logical move from OpenAI and is great news for AMD,” said Barringer. It’s no surprise that the eight most valuable companies on the market are all heavily invested in AI — and all are worth more than $1.4 trillion. Following Nvidia are Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META), each of which announced new consumer-focused AI products in recent months. Broadcom, with a $1.6 trillion valuation, is No. 7 on the list. And Elon Musk’s Tesla, which has bet its future on AI-powered robotaxis and could soon make a large investment in Musk’s xAI company, is No. 8 on the list. Although those companies have driven enormous market gains over the past several years, many Wall Street analysts fear that the AI market has become a bubble — powered by unsustainable gains that are driven more by FOMO than fundamentals.

Title: Major challenge to Nvidia: OpenAI’s massive new computing push will run on AMD chips | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks In a significant challenge to Nvidia’s dominance, OpenAI announced Monday it would buy 6 gigawatts of computing power from data centers that will run exclusively on AMD chips. Nvidia (NVDA) has become the go-to AI chipmaker in recent years, propelling it to a $4.6 trillion market capitalization that has made it the world’s most valuable public company. OpenAI, famous for its ChatGPT AI chatbot, is the artificial-intelligence frontrunner that just made waves when it launched the breakthrough video generator Sora 2. Just two weeks ago, the companies announced a $100 billion partnership, in which Nvidia agreed to start delivering chips in 2026. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a post on X that the company plans to increase its Nvidia purchasing and that the AMD partnership is “incremental” to its “work with Nvidia.” But AMD is no slouch, and demand for AI computing power is so high that OpenAI needed to hedge its bets. The deal will provide OpenAI with 1 gigawatt of power by this time next year and it will add another 5 gigawatts on future generations of AMD’s high-end Instinct processors. OpenAI will work with AMD (AMD) to build the technology, and it will invest significantly in AMD to fuel its chip-building capabilities. Shares of AMD jumped 36% in premarket trading on the news. Shares of Nvidia fell 2%. “With a 10% stake in AMD this quickly brings Lisa Su and AMD right into the core of the AI chip spending cycle and is a huge vote of confidence from OpenAI and Altman,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in an industry note Monday morning. The companies said the partnership would deliver tens of billions of dollars of revenue for AMD, but they didn’t disclose the exact amount of the deal. AMD issued OpenAI a warrant of 160 million shares of its stock, worth more than $26.3 billion at Friday’s closing price. Those shares would vest over time as the partnership achieves specific milestones, including share-price targets and overcoming technological hurdles for what Lisa Su, AMD’s CEO, called “the world’s most ambitious AI buildout.” “This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realize AI’s full potential,” Altman said in a statement. “AMD’s leadership in high-performance chips will enable us to accelerate progress and bring the benefits of advanced AI to everyone faster.” Su called the partnership a “win-win.” The amount of money getting thrown around the AI industry is staggering.

The deal offers OpenAI an opportunity to take a stake in one of Nvidia's most formidable rivals and is a powerful endorsement of Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD's) AI chips and software. "We view this deal as certainly transformative, not just for AMD, but for the dynamics of the industry," AMD executive vice president Forrest Norrod told Reuters on Sunday. The agreement covers the deployment of hundreds of thousands of AMD's AI chips, or graphics processing units (GPUs), equivalent to six gigawatts, over several years beginning in the second half of 2026. AMD said OpenAI would build a one-gigawatt facility based on its forthcoming MI450 series of chips beginning next year, and that it would begin to recognize revenue then. AMD executives expect the deal to net tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue. Because of the ripple effect of the agreement, AMD expects to receive more than $100 billion in new revenue over four years from OpenAI and other customers, they said. "Other people are going to come along with it because this is really the pioneer, a pioneer in the industry that has a lot of influence over the broader ecosystem," AMD strategy chief Mat Hein said. The deal with AMD will help OpenAI build enough AI infrastructure to meet its needs, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimate AMD will generate revenue of $32.78 billion this year, according to LSEG data. As part of the arrangement, AMD issued a warrant that gives OpenAI the ability to buy up to 160 million shares of AMD for 1 cent each over the course of the chips deal. The warrant vests in tranches based on milestones that the two companies have agreed on. The first tranche will vest after the initial shipment of MI450 chips set for the second half of 2026. The remaining milestones include specific AMD stock price targets that escalate to $600 a share for the final installment of stock to unlock. AMD has 1.62 billion shares outstanding and is valued at $267.23 billion, according to LSEG data. Its shares closed on Friday at $164.67. OpenAI has a valuation of $500 billion. OpenAI has worked with AMD for years, providing inputs on the design of older generations of AI chips such as the MI300X. The San Francisco-based AI company has been taking a number of steps to ensure it has the chips needed for its future needs. In September, Nvidia announced an investment of up to $100 billion in OpenAI that included a plan to supply at least 10 gigawatts worth of Nvidia systems. The plan includes OpenAI deploying a gigawatt of Nvidia's next-generation Vera Rubin chips in late 2026. In addition to using Nvidia hardware, cloud computing giants such as Alphabet's Google and Amazon build their own in-house processors. Similarly, OpenAI is in the process of developing its own silicon for AI use and has partnered with Broadcom, Reuters reported last year. OpenAI and its main backer Microsoft also announced last month that they had signed a non-binding agreement to restructure OpenAI into a for-profit entity, signaling further changes in the governance of the fast-growing AI company. A person familiar with the matter said the deal with AMD does not change any of OpenAI's ongoing compute plans, including that effort or its partnership with Microsoft. (Reporting by Max A.

(File image: Reuters/Dado Ruvic) SAN FRANCISCO: AMD will supply artificial intelligence chips to OpenAI in a multi-year deal that would bring in tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue and give the ChatGPT creator the option to buy up to roughly 10 per cent of the chipmaker. Shares of the chipmaker surged more than 34 per cent on Monday (Oct 6), putting them on track for their biggest one-day gain in over nine years and adding roughly US$80 billion to the company's market value. The deal, latest in a string of investment commitments, underscores OpenAI and the broader AI industry's voracious appetite for computing power as companies race toward developing AI technology that meets or exceeds human intelligence. "We view this deal as certainly transformative, not just for AMD, but for the dynamics of the industry," AMD executive vice president Forrest Norrod told Reuters on Sunday.

The chipmaker is expected to report revenue of US$32.78 billion this year, according to LSEG data. In contrast, analysts are expecting Nvidia to report revenue of US$206.26 billion for the current fiscal year. "AMD has really trailed Nvidia for quite some time. So I think it helps validate their technology," said Leah Bennett, chief investment strategist at Concurrent Asset Management. Shares of Nvidia dipped more than 1 per cent. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the AMD deal will help his startup build enough AI infrastructure to meet its needs. It was not immediately clear how OpenAI would fund the massive deal. OpenAI, which is valued at US$500 billion, generated around US$4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025 and burned through US$2.5 billion in cash, according to media reports. As part of the arrangement, AMD issued a warrant that gives OpenAI the ability to buy up to 160 million shares of AMD for 1 cent each over the course of the chip deal. The warrant vests in tranches based on milestones that the two companies have agreed on. The first tranche will vest after the initial shipment of MI450 chips set for the second half of 2026. The remaining milestones include specific AMD stock price targets that escalate to US$600 a share for the final installment of stock to unlock. In September, Nvidia announced a deal to supply OpenAI with at least 10 gigawatts worth of its systems. In contrast with the startup's deal with AMD where it will take a stake in the chipmaker, Nvidia will invest US$100 billion in the ChatGPT parent under the terms of the agreement announced in September. Taking a stake in AMD could give OpenAI "the power to potentially influence corporate strategy. With Nvidia, OpenAI is simply the client and not a part-owner," said Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell. OpenAI has worked with AMD for years, providing inputs on the design of older generations of AI chips such as the MI300X. The San Francisco-based AI company has been taking a number of steps to ensure it has the chips needed for its future needs. Altman has floated expectations of reaching 250 gigawatts of compute in total by 2033, The Information has reported. OpenAI's deal last month with Nvidia includes the deployment of one gigawatt of the chip giant's next-generation Vera Rubin processors in late 2026.

Title: Why Private Equity Is Making Small-Cap Investing Harder

Active managers like to tout their defy-the-odds abilities, but chances to get in on tomorrow’s large cap stocks slimmer, Morningstar says. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com It’s getting tough out there for the little guys. Small-cap stocks have started to lose some of their performance zing compared with large caps. The reason: Private equity and venture capital firms have been snapping up many promising small companies that otherwise would likely have gone public, wresting those potentially lucrative opportunities away from public investors. Over the past two years there has been a widening gap in quality between large-cap and small-cap stocks, according to a recent Morningstar analysis. That includes returns on assets, returns on equity, net margin and debt-to-capital ratios showing that overall, small-cap stocks have increasingly weaker fundamentals compared with large caps, Morningstar passive strategies analyst Zachary Evens said. It’s not hard to find examples of once-startups that have rocketed to become massive companies that would be right at home next to the Magnificent Seven, if they ever had IPOs: OpenAI, SpaceX and Anthropic, for example, Evens noted. “Increasingly, tomorrow’s huge stocks are already big,” he wrote. And if the trend continues, “tomorrow’s big stocks never exist as a small-cap public company.” The tradeoff for the higher volatility of small caps is the potential for outperformance. But the prospects for that have been eroding quickly. Between 1991 and 2024, Morningstar’s US Small Cap Index lagged the US Large Cap Index by 0.49% per year on average, amounting to a 400% lag cumulatively. Still, small caps as a whole outperformed large caps from the mid ‘90s until about 2014, when the relative growth of the small cap index began to slide. In a recent whitepaper, Osterweis Capital Management cited opportunities for small-cap active managers: Let’s Go Out in Public: It could be a time for active managers to really show their worth. They’re just going to have a difficult time doing so, Evens noted. “It provides opportunities for the best small-cap managers, but it doesn’t change the opportunity set from which they are picking stocks,” he said. “Even the best active managers may not have the opportunity to invest in the highest growth potential small-cap stocks, if those remain in private markets.” The SEC halted operations last week amid the federal government shutdown, pausing dozens of ETF applications. It may not be an ideal time for high-yield corporate bonds, but State Street is filling out its target-maturity suite with several new ETFs. ETF share classes of mutual funds (and the other way around) are so close, yet so very far away, as fund boards have a lot of work ahead. Semiliquid funds topped $450 billion in assets, but a handful of private credit ETFs have been slow to win over investors. ETFs that use artificial intelligence to select holdings have largely underperformed over the past five years. Many have closed. The company is reportedly considering adding third-party products to its brokerage,, but Vanguard said it hasn’t made any decisions. The ETF strategy lets wealthy investors defer, or even avoid, capital gains tax liabilities. Man Group is the latest to join the ETF bonanza, and it’s far from alone. The company, whose parent is the personal finance publisher, would add 15 ETFs to its existing line of six. Big, multinational firms have regional expertise and may be able to swallow the costs, but smaller companies will have a harder time. Investors in YieldMax ETFs may have lost about 11% per year since late 2022, according to a recent Morningstar report. ETF uptake varies significantly across generations. This gap presents a major growth opportunity for the industry. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Morgan Stanley’s new investment guidance could channel up to $80B into Bitcoin

Morgan Stanley now likens Bitcoin to digital gold and advises up to 4% allocation for growth portfolios. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Morgan Stanley’s Global Investment Committee has issued new guidance encouraging investors to dedicate a small but deliberate portion of their portfolios to Bitcoin. The bank’s analysts now view the world’s largest crypto as a “scarce asset similar to digital gold,” recommending an allocation of 2% to 4% depending on risk appetite. Given that Morgan Stanley’s GIC oversees strategy for about 16,000 financial advisors managing roughly $2 trillion in client wealth, even modest adoption could introduce tens of billions in new inflows to Bitcoin. Consequently, the bank’s recommendation could translate to as much as $40 to $80 billion in potential fresh investment into BTC. Exhibit 12: GIC Recommendations for Maximum Cryptocurrency Allocations in Multiasset Portfolios According to the guidance, investors with Opportunistic Growth portfolios (i.e., those comfortable with greater volatility) can hold up to 4% in Bitcoin or similar digital assets. Meanwhile, those with Balanced Growth strategies are advised to keep exposure below 2%, while portfolios focused on preserving capital or generating income should avoid crypto entirely. Still, GIC cautioned that Bitcoin could experience sharper swings during macroeconomic stress, though it acknowledged that the asset’s volatility has significantly reduced in recent years. Nonetheless, this decision reflects a shift in tone from the firm’s earlier caution, when crypto exposure was limited to select high-net-worth clients. Under that framework, qualified investors with at least $1.5 million in net worth and a high risk tolerance were allowed to invest in Bitcoin. Morgan Stanley’s recommendation perfectly illustrates the broader reappraisal of digital assets within the traditional financial ecosystem. The bank’s view now aligns with that of BlackRock, which argued that allocating up to 2% of a diversified portfolio to Bitcoin is a “reasonable” approach for long-term investors. Similarly, billionaire investor Ray Dalio has argued that a small Bitcoin position can function as an inflation hedge, comparable to gold, due to its finite supply. Industry observers see these shifts as a cultural turning point that would spark further adoption and growth for the emerging asset class. Samuel Grisanzio, chief marketing officer at Wolf Financial, said: “The shift from ‘stay away’ to ‘flexibly allocate’ in traditional wealth management language is absolutely massive for adoption honestly.” That evolution follows growing client demand since the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024. Those products unlocked easier access to the asset and helped propel its price past $125,000, reinforcing Bitcoin’s role as a legitimate component of modern wealth strategies and a bridge between traditional finance and the digital economy.

They're still in the early innings of their careers, but these dealmakers and investors are already setting the agenda for the next era of finance. Each year, Business Insider spotlights up-and-coming Wall Streeters who are making an outsize impact in investing, trading, and dealmaking. The process starts with nominations from bosses, colleagues, recruiters, and other industry insiders. To be considered, nominees must be US-based, 35 or younger, and stand out among their peers. Business Insider's editors make the final selections. This year's class reflects some of the hottest areas of the industry, from private credit to advising on multibillion-dollar data center deals. They come from powerhouse firms like JPMorgan, Apollo, Citadel, and Bridgewater. One was recently promoted to chief of staff to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Meet the 25 newest inductees to Business Insider's annual list of young people who exemplify the drive and creativity needed to succeed in one of the most competitive industries in the world. After a slow start to the year amid uncertainty over tariffs, geopolitical risks, and recession fears, dealmaking is regaining momentum. Bankers and private-equity investors are finding their stride, driving major IPOs, carve-outs, and buyouts. Here are some top dealmakers to watch. Jack Levendoski is riding the rebound in M&A after a rocky start to the year. An executive director in JPMorgan's M&A group, he has worked on some of 2025's largest technology transactions, including Palo Alto Networks' $25 billion acquisition of CyberArk and Xero's $2.5 billion purchase of Melio. After a choppy first half marked by rate uncertainty and geopolitical risk, he says the market now "feels extremely busy." He's used to big-ticket transactions: In 2022, Levendoski was part of Twitter's $44 billion sale to Elon Musk, a transaction that unfolded under global scrutiny. "The pace at which that all happened, the level of public scrutiny‚ it was pretty amazing," he told Business Insider. He also worked on Squarespace's $6.9 billion take-private with Permira in 2024, Savvy Gaming Group's $4.9 billion acquisition of Scopely in 2023, and the merger of World Wrestling Entertainment and UFC, valued at about $21 billion. Levendoski's father worked in oil and gas, and the family moved often, living in Louisiana, London, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Australia. "Growing up where the environment was always changing and kind of always finding your feet and figuring it out," he says, adding that it also gave him an appreciation for different viewpoints and the ability to adapt quickly. That flexibility has been essential across more than $300 billion in deal value he has advised on. Artificial intelligence has been a recurring theme in recent deals, in how companies are valued and in how bankers operate. Being an early adopter has given Levendoski "quick answers to hard questions that perhaps before required significant research," he said. After starting his career at Chevron, where he worked as a facilities engineering project manager, Levendoski joined JPMorgan in 2016, supporting capital projects and offshore oil and gas projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Having benefited from mentors early on, he now tries to do the same for others: "I saw the value that it created for me, and so I've tried to play that forward." Mary-Grace Papatheodorou worked on her first IPO in 2012, as an analyst on Jefferies' equity capital markets desk. She remembers watching in awe as the woman running Manchester United's equity syndicate negotiated prices and stake sizes with hungry investors. "I remember thinking to myself at the time, wow, that's the coolest job I've ever seen," Papatheodorou told Business Insider. She went right up and asked if she could join the equity syndicate team. Years later, she thinks that directness was a secret weapon that has helped propel her up the ranks. Today, she's a managing director on Morgan Stanley's global capital markets' equity syndicate desk. "I have to ask investors to step on price or to accept smaller or larger allocations to move the demand. You have to ask — the worst that can happen is someone says no, and at least then you know your answer," she said. "It's tough to put yourself out there, but it's a lot worse not to." Papatheodorou spent nearly 10 years at Jefferies before joining Morgan Stanley in 2021. She managed the equity syndicates of some of this year's highest-profile IPOs, including Figma, Chime, and CoreWeave. Her role, she admits, is "incredibly high pressure." Her calls on price, sizing, and risk can dictate how a stock trades the very next day. Making those calls is also part of the fun, she said. Like the markets, her job is always evolving. She doesn't get a lot of sleep when IPO season is in full swing. Now on maternity leave after giving birth to her first child in August, she's embraced a similar routine. "Having a child is a little bit of a different animal, but equally as demanding as some of our clients," she joked. As a principal investing in sports teams for Blue Owl, Lamar Cardinez is living a version of his dreams he didn't know was possible. Cardinez had ambitions to play professional football, but when that didn't happen, he pivoted to working in sports — interning at Madison Square Garden and joining the 2014 Super Bowl host committee. That led him to the National Football League's rotational program, where he worked in media, business development, and strategy. He planned to climb the ladder there, then realized that the work he was most interested in was reserved for those with finance backgrounds. Encouraged by longtime NFL executive and ex-Goldman Sachs banker Eric Grubman, Cardinez pursued an MBA at Cornell before landing in investment banking at Guggenheim Securities. Then came a fateful call from Dyal Capital Partners (soon to become Blue Owl). The firm had just launched HomeCourt Partners, a fund partnership with the National Basketball Association, to buy minority stakes in teams. It was a "no-brainer" for him, he said. Cardinez joined in 2021, shortly after the fund's first investment in the Phoenix Suns, then valued at $1.55 billion. He later worked on the franchise's $4 billion sale to mortgage magnate Mat Ishbia in 2022 and has since contributed to four more NBA deals — a period during which the average value of an NBA team nearly doubled, according to Blue Owl. He sources potential deals by "hanging around the hoop" and getting to know the league's hundreds of minority investors and would-be buyers. His team spent two years engaging with Alex Rodriguez's consortium before striking a 2024 deal for the Minnesota Timberwolves. Cardinez's skill in underwriting sports teams as they turn from "vanity and trophy assets" to money-makers is built on his operational knowledge of sports and his financial expertise. His blueprint for valuation has since been replicated across sports leagues and geographies, the firm said. Golf was Jackie Shepherd's training for Wall Street. She was a competitive player from age 7 through college, where she earned a full-ride scholarship and was a two-time captain of the University of Minnesota team. Though she dreamed of turning pro, Shepherd carried over her patience and precision to a career advising companies on breaking out parts of their business. "Golf is all about strategy," she said. "I think a lot of that really translated over to the separations work that I do, where it's very detailed, you really have to get into the weeds, it's hyper strategy focused — and these are really long lead time transactions." Shepherd is a vice president in Morgan Stanley's Separations and Structured Solutions group, which specializes in helping companies transform subsidiaries into standalone entities. She has advised on about $250 billion worth of corporate spin-offs, including Comcast's pending carve-out of its cable networks into Versant Media Group. She says it's a "unique way" for Comcast to become more focused on where the future of media is going. The goal with the deals she works on is to "disentangle" businesses that don't make sense together but are strong and "have agendas that they want to do on their own." Shepherd started her career in accounting on EY's international tax team, where she first saw the work of investment bankers up close. "I didn't realize that there was an intersection between the two," she said. "I wanted to be the person coming up with more of the cool ideas." She restarted her career in M&A and was recruited as an analyst by Goldman, where she found her mentor, Michael Kagan; she later followed him to Citi and Morgan Stanley, which she joined in 2023. Shepherd still plays golf, and her goal is to play on all seven continents. Asia was checked off last summer: "My golf clubs have seen a lot of airline miles." In 2022, Florian Plath got a call from one of his bosses at JPMorgan Chase with an assignment: Join the deal team on Broadcom's $90 billion acquisition of VMware, one of the largest tech acquisitions in history. It was a pivotal and fast-moving experience for the banker, who's since advised on other multibillion-dollar transactions, including Altair's $10.6 billion sale to Siemens and Altium's $6 billion sale to Renesas. Earlier in his career, he worked on Maxim Integrated's $29 billion all-stock merger with Analog Devices — one of the largest semiconductor transactions on record. Plath started at JPMorgan as an intern in the London office. Today, he is an executive director and top advisor in its mergers and acquisitions group, working with leading technology clients. Reflecting on these deals, Plath said the constant across them is how quickly teams must mobilize and solve problems in dynamic markets — especially those as ever-changing as the tech sector. He has observed that strategic corporate buyers, after a quieter stretch, have recently begun revving the engine of dealmaking activity again — especially around AI and software — while private equity sponsors continue to search for bargain buys. Plath is based in San Francisco, and the native of Germany has studied in Asia and lived in London, so he's formed a global worldview. He moved to California in 2018. "Right from the start, I knew I wanted to, at some point if the opportunity arose, to live and work in the US," he said, pointing to its position as the leading capital market. His international upbringing, he added, "further sparked my interest in global markets." At JPMorgan, he has also served as a staffer — the linchpin for team coordination — for the North America analyst and associate program, working hand-in-hand with junior bankers on the front lines of deal teams. An avid runner who also enjoys golf and tennis, he credits sports with keeping him grounded in a high-pressure business. "For me, it has always been a team sport," he said, "doing what's right for our clients, the firm, and the employees." From working as a Radio Disney DJ through middle and high school to graduating in the top 5% of her Harvard Business School MBA class as a Baker Scholar, Natalie Lamberton has long been a high achiever with an entrepreneurial streak. It makes sense she's found success at GTCR, the Chicago-based private equity firm where she became one of its youngest directors. "I can chase whatever opportunities I like, which is motivating," she told Business Insider. As an associate in 2016, she played a key role in GTCR's $500 million investment in Lytx, a global leader in video telematics, together with a firm partner. Two years later, GTCR sold a stake in the company, whose valuation had more than tripled to $1.7 billion, to a Clearlake Capital—led investor group. Lamberton joined GTCR after starting her career at Goldman Sachs in leveraged finance. She's since worked on over a dozen deals, including the 2023 acquisition of Once For All, a construction supply chain platform. She helped bring on a new CEO — a key part of GTCR's playbook — and later spearheaded its 2024 expansion into Spain with the acquisition of Nalanda. Returning from parental leave after the birth of her first child in March, Lamberton is focused on vertical software across government technology, supply chain, and workforce tools — and how AI can help portfolio companies achieve their goals more efficiently. "It helps us accelerate our development road map materially," she said. Her father, a salesman in the industrial sector, taught her to approach challenges with curiosity rather than a fear of failure. That has allowed her to walk into situations with the mindset of "why not try to apply myself and see what happens." Lamberton nearly pursued theater before choosing Wharton for undergrad. The “calculated risk taker” in her decided a career onstage wasn’t the right fit. She'd love to get back into it at some point, but right now her performances are reserved for her 6-month-old daughter in their kitchen. Infrastructure has become one of Wall Street's hottest bets. Investors are pouring billions into everything from power grids and data centers to roads and airports, fueling the AI boom and energy transition while upgrading aging assets. Investor assets in private infrastructure funds have soared to $1.5 trillion in 2024 from $500 billion in 2016, according to McKinsey. Meet some of the names you should know as the space continues to gain momentum. The data center industry has become a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity that has transfixed Wall Street. Aman Mittal, a managing director at Moelis & Company, is helping the storied advisory firm establish itself as a leading player in the mergers and acquisitions, investments, and debt deals that are fast shaping the sector. The 35-year-old advised the data center company Core Scientific on its announced $9 billion sale to CoreWeave and worked with Apollo on its deal to buy a majority stake in the data center developer and operator Stream Data Centers. He also helped another large data center platform, Prime Data Centers, arrange the sale of an undisclosed ownership stake in it to institutional investors Snowhawk and Nuveen. And that was just over the summer. In the past three years, Mittal has worked on more than 15 data center-related transactions with a total deal value exceeding $25 billion. Mittal got his start studying electronics and communications engineering in his home country of India before getting an MBA at the NYU Stern School of Business. He began as an analyst at Bain & Company in technology, media, and telecom, before moving to Evercore to advise in those sectors. In 2022, he joined Moelis to help lead its growing practice in the booming digital infrastructure space, particularly data center deals. Mittal said that he keeps his focus straightforward: knowing his clients and anticipating the solutions that match their business needs. "The idea is that you need to know what is important to the company and the company needs to feel comfortable about sharing their constantly changing objectives with you," Mittal said. "My position is like: this is what you're doing, and this could become better if you do this also." Mittal starts his day by jotting down three Post-it notes outlining his priorities. He ends every day with a call, "that is not related to my immediate tasks." "I'll just reach out to someone I have not talked to in three months or six months," Mittal said. "To reconnect with potential possibilities." A demanding career on Wall Street requires resilience, a quality that Arting Chang had mastered before she landed in the industry. As an eighth grader, her father's investment banking job moved her and her family from Taiwan to California. Before that, her family had lived in Shanghai and Tokyo. The frequent moves taught her to be adaptable in a way that helped her career. "I think I have a way of talking to myself very kindly and giving myself encouragement to be like — you know how to do this, you've done this, you've been in more chaotic environments," she said. Now a vice president at Advent International, a private equity firm that manages $94 billion, Chang has emerged as a young star in its industrials team. She helped lead Advent's $1 billion acquisition of LayerZero Power Systems, a producer of data-center power equipment, earlier this year. Chang co-launched Advent's first dedicated data-center sourcing effort. The team built a bottom-up model of how growth would unfold, assembled a bench of executives, and networked with regional, niche bankers so that they'd come to her when deals arose. The introduction to LayerZero came through a relationship at Citizens Bank, months before a formal sale process began. Chang said she's a "big proponent of always getting on the ground." At AEA Investors, where she worked before Advent, she spent a year in Dallas helping prepare retailer At Home for its IPO. While digging into LayerZero, time at the Ohio headquarters revealed an opportunity for an expansion that became central to the deal. She still visits monthly for board meetings. Off the clock, Chang is a regular at Barry's Bootcamp, a restaurant lover, and a proud collector of 50-plus statement blazers. She sits on the steering committee for Advent's LGBTQ+ employee resource group and is the youngest board member of Out for Undergrad, a nonprofit that helps LGBTQ+ college students explore careers in finance and other competitive industries. When Mohini Chakravorty joined Blackstone Infrastructure in 2019, the team had around $5 billion in assets and only a handful of staff. Five years later, a team of around 100 manages $64 billion — and she's had a front-row seat to explosive growth that has shaped her career. "It's been just a wild ride. It's really rare to see that kind of growth and that kind of rapid evolution," Chakravorty said. Chakravorty's first stop after Wharton was Bank of America, where she followed her older brother into investment banking. It wasn't surprising to anyone, as he'd always been a role model, she said, but she quickly found herself drawn more to private equity. Since joining Blackstone, Chakravorty has contributed to more than $16 billion in transactions across the infrastructure sector. One key moment came when she helped acquire a stake in Phoenix Tower International in 2022, the biggest private cellphone tower platform in Europe and the Americas. Chakravorty credits much of her success to keeping a positive attitude, even when making rapid and stressful judgment calls. She remembers when, minutes before a key meeting, her team identified a downside scenario they needed to review. Even with the time crunch, Chakravorty helped create a straightforward analytical approach to quantify the potential problem, which became the focus of the discussion. The same composure came into play when she helped acquire the largest yacht and marina servicing company, Safe Harbor Marinas, for $5.6 billion on a "very accelerated" timeline earlier this year. Much of Chakravorty's job involves relationship-building, which comes easily since she's a natural extrovert. Chakravorty also focuses on showing other young women who are interested in investing that there's room for them in the profession. "The advice that I tell myself and give to young women is to run towards what scares you. Facing challenges head-on helps you break down some of those roadblocks," she said. Benson Kane was in seventh grade in Weston, Connecticut, when the 2008 financial crisis hit, and he remembers being fascinated by the underpinnings of the unfolding calamity. "All of a sudden, this big event happened and I was interested in understanding what this was and how it had such a massive impact on the broader world," Kane said. Throughout middle and high school, his interest in debt and credit persisted. He avidly followed Elliott Investment Management's efforts in the news to collect on its investment in Argentine bonds that the country had defaulted on. After studying finance at Brigham Young University, Kane joined Angelo Gordon in 2020, which became part of TPG in 2023. He's now a vice president on its credit solutions team. The group focuses on extending debt and providing other capital solutions to companies that often face financial distress or complex business challenges. Kane focuses on companies in the chemicals and materials manufacturing sectors, as well as those involved in energy infrastructure, including power plants and pipelines. "I love complex problems, trying to figure them out," Kane said. In 2023, for instance, Kane, 29, worked on a $1 billion-plus loan provided to Trinseo, a materials company, funded by TPG, Oaktree Capital, and Apollo. "We were able to provide liquidity to a company in need of it and that wasn't able to get it from other sources, and we were able to preserve the business," Kane said, explaining that the company and others like it in the materials and chemicals industries had been hit by a downturn in demand post-pandemic. Kane is excelling in a newer world of distressed credit where, he said, there is often a more congenial relationship between lenders and borrowers. "We're working in a much more collaborative fashion, trying to be solutions providers, a little bit less sharp-elbowed maybe than the past," Kane said. "Relationships matter, reputations matter. People want to work with people that are good to work with in terms of company." The growth of private markets has reshaped Wall Street, turning private equity, credit, and secondaries into some of the most dynamic parts of finance. Behind the growth is a new generation of talent driving major buyouts, capital raises, and fund innovations. Meet the rising stars helping define the strategies and structures that will shape how trillions of dollars flow through global markets. Private credit's first iteration was all about lending to companies that do not have access to traditional bank financing. Now, private credit 2.0 — the shift to customizing loans for investment-grade companies — is on the rise, and Madelaine O'Connell is helping write the playbook. O'Connell is a managing director in HPS' $25 billion private high-grade business. Her team designs creative alternatives to issuing a plain-vanilla bond, such as helping a Fortune 500 company finance a new project through a joint venture — keeping the debt off its balance sheet while giving investors, like insurers, a steady return. She thinks the industry has "just scratched the surface" of structuring bespoke deals that can't be found in the public bond market, she told Business Insider. "Every transaction we work on has nuances that have definitely pushed me personally to think outside the box," she said. O'Connell began her career at Citi in the securitized products division before Goldman Sachs tapped her and her then-boss to help rebuild its private placement franchise, which had been dormant since the 1990s. She said the effort was like a "de-risked startup," integrating with investment-banking teams, winning trust deal by deal, and building relationships on the buy side. She led the team from 2020, and by the time she left in 2024, it was lending to fund managers and lending against esoteric assets like media rights. They were also early to financing data centers — something that was cutting-edge at the time, she said. The explosive growth in private credit was "very much the thesis" behind her move to HPS, which the $12.5 trillion asset manager BlackRock acquired in July, giving her team even more firepower. A lifelong dancer, O'Connell began teaching fitness classes at Boston College and even led 6 a.m. Pilates sessions while working as an investment banker. She still teaches online occasionally when travel allows. "Working out is just as important to my mental health as it is to my physical health," she said. In Knut Kirchhoff's nine years of working in private credit, the segment has grown to become one of the hottest places for young job seekers in finance. As a leader of the analyst and associate recruiting efforts for Blackstone's Credit and Insurance team, he's seen this transformation firsthand. At a Georgetown recruiting event that drew more than 100 students, Kirchoff had nonstop conversations about private credit and "lost my voice by the end of the night," he said. A Norwegian who attended Boston University for college, Kirchoff began his career on Citi's leveraged finance team. He quickly became fascinated with the world of debt, and after two years, he realized he wanted to move to the buy side. His interest was piqued by a few successful deals that Blackstone Credit (then GSO) did with Citi during a period of energy price volatility in 2015. When he joined Blackstone in 2016, the firm's credit unit had roughly $80 billion in assets. It has since swelled to over $400 billion, becoming the firm's largest and fastest-growing business. "The first deal I did was $125 million," Kirchoff said. "Now we're doing billion-dollar deals almost every single week." Last year, Kirchoff helped create the professional services vertical, lending to consulting and accounting firms. The team, which Kirchoff now leads, has made over $10 billion in credit investments. The deal that catapulted his career occurred early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when Kirchoff was tapped to work on lending to cruise lines. As some deals were launching, the leading managing director went on paternity leave, leaving Kirchoff to step into a leadership position. "I had been promoted four months earlier and was working from home, and now had the responsibility of a team under me," Kirchoff said. He led diligence on the deal and brought it through the investment committee. Blackstone's purchase of the cruise line debt "ended up being a really good transaction for the firm," Kirchoff said. Patrick Kearney has developed a specialty for buying airlines and packaging companies during his eight years at Apollo. It's a product of Apollo's "generalist" model, the principal told Business Insider, which has new hires rotate through different business units and industries. His first deal was the 2018 acquisition of Sun Country Airlines, and aviation has been a constant since. Airline ownership allows Kearney to flex his business-building muscles — navigating Trump's tariffs, investing in more aircraft, and modernizing operations at a portfolio company, Atlas Air. "There's never a dull day when you own an airline in terms of the problems that you have to solve," he said. And even though he's based in the firm's flagship private equity arm, he still works closely with Apollo's ground-breaking credit team. "We don't have any walls at Apollo," he said about the firm he joined in 2017 after spending two years at Moelis & Company. Credit and equity teams share research, insights, expertise, and even deals. The credit side can help make equity investments possible when financing is tight, such as with the firm's 2022 $5.2 billion take-private of cargo airline Atlas Air, Kearney said. "We financed Atlas when the financing markets, frankly, were not open," Kearney said. Kearney's work on the 2022 acquisition of Novolex and the 2025 combination with Pactiv, both food packaging businesses, is another example of his ability to grow companies. When Kearney and his team initially considered Novolex, they evaluated what the combined business would look like with Pactiv, given their complementary products. It didn't pan out, but at the end of last year, Novolex announced it would acquire Pactiv, with the deal expected to close this year. "It's rare to have something like that in your original investment committee dialogue and actually have it come to fruition," Kearney said. The first deal of Alex Park's career was far from the sleek software buyouts he's versed in now — it was a Chapter 11 bankruptcy for a school bus company that he happened to use as a kid. "Buses were stolen out of the parking lot in Staten Island, and I actually had to work with the local police force to try and locate these buses," he laughed. That experience sparked his interest in working in credit: "I wanted to see what a healthy and growing company looked like." That realization carried Park from restructuring at Rothschild to Ares Management, and ultimately to Thoma Bravo, where he joined the credit team shortly after its inception in 2019. Now a principal, he's helped the credit team invest more than $8 billion across about 100 transactions. Miami-based Park is "incredibly proud" of sourcing and leading financing for Blackstone's acquisition of Irth Solutions in 2021 and Warburg Pincus' financing of Softeon in 2023 — two "best in class" SaaS companies, he said. "Everyone wants to lead deals for these sponsors," Park said. While Thoma Bravo's credit team has been well established, it's "still relatively new" compared to some players, he noted. Outside of investing, Park has played a key role in fundraising, including helping to complete the $3.6 billion Credit Fund III, the platform's largest pool of capital to date, in early 2025. He credits his career success to a "chip on my shoulder" work ethic, a love of building relationships, and especially a commitment to mentorship. In fact, a banker from Rothschild, Brendan Fox, who took him "under his wing," is on his team at Thoma. He said a number of colleagues "played such a formative role in shaping me that I always wanted to pay that forward going forward." Today, Park leads recruiting for the credit team, creating an "open-door" culture for juniors: "I want you to feel comfortable asking me anything and everything — no dumb questions." When Joe Slevin started specializing in the resale market of private equity stakes in 2015, it was a niche that "barely existed," he told Business Insider. Now, secondary deals are on the rise — with a record $103 billion worth of activity completed globally in the first six months of 2025, according to Jefferies. UK-native Slevin started his career as a JPMorgan investment banker in London, then sought "an area of finance where there was huge growth potential," that was "off the beaten path." He joined Coller Capital, a pioneer in what was then the nascent secondaries industry. After three years on the buy side, Slevin returned to banking to advise investors on secondary transactions at PJT Partners and Guggenheim Partners because, he said, he preferred being "at the center of things between all the stakeholders in a transaction." He said his time on the buy side made him a better advisor since he had to bring "extremely nuanced" deals through investment committees. In 2021, he joined Jefferies to cofound their Private Capital Advisory team, which now has more than 120 members and advises investors on selling some of their private portfolios to other investors and fund operators on spinning out select assets into new funds. In the first half of this year, the PCA team advised on over $31 billion in secondary transactions. Slevin focuses on deals led by private equity or credit operators, recently working with ONCAP, Gryphon Partners, and Trinity Ventures. The most well-known version of this is a continuation fund, which is set up to buy one or more assets they already own — giving liquidity to investors who need it while continuing to wring returns out of assets. This segment of the industry has experienced a surge in popularity in recent years, as private equity distributions have fallen short of expectations. Earlier this year, Slevin moved to Los Angeles from New York to expand his team's geographic reach, focusing on West Coast private equity and venture capital operators. About four years ago, Josef Menasche was working at a boutique secondaries firm on a deal alongside Goldman Sachs bankers. He came away convinced that his industry, which deals in sales of private fund stakes, was headed for change. "My whole thesis was big banks are going to dominate this space eventually," he said. So he called Goldman and said, "Hey, you should just hire me because we already had a great working dynamic on this deal. Wouldn't it be better if we were actually working together?" He joined the bank's secondaries business at the end of 2021 and today is a managing director and global cohead of secondaries advisory. He said 2025 has been a turning point, following several years of caution among investors regarding capital commitments. "The level of creativity that we've seen in 2025 has been really, really exciting to work with," he said — a sign that the market is picking up. His team has executed transactions across infrastructure, real estate, private equity, and venture capital. The highlights include a $3.1 billion single-asset continuation vehicle — allowing a private equity firm to extend its investment in a company — with New Mountain Capital for Real Chemistry. "Half of it was providing the distribution to original investors, half was actually primary capital for future M&A, which is pretty unusual," he said. "The fact that they're willing to put so much fresh money into the new M&A through another business is pretty unusual. It's a general sign of people feeling good about the world." His team has just over a dozen bankers, compared with about 150 at its largest competitor, he said. Clients often tell him: "You give us very different advice to other bankers, and it seems to work out well for us." Menasche studied chemistry at Cambridge. He found the lab environment too slow and shifted into finance. Early experience at secondaries-focused boutique Campbell Lutyens gave him a foothold in the industry. "I think fundamentally, if you just pick what you're interested in, you will do well," he said. ​​Reading the tea leaves of geopolitics, policy, and markets has never been more important. These rising macro minds spend their days researching and understanding global risks and opportunities — whether to arm clients with insights for critical decisions or to pull the trigger on trades themselves. Citadel portfolio manager Adam Theriault-Shay's obsession with digging into obscure corners of global markets and conducting on-the-ground research to get satisfying answers sets him apart in a world fixated on data and artificial intelligence. It has also helped him earn a rates-and-currencies trading book of more than $1 billion before the age of 30, managing risk in line with that of macro hedge fund veterans. As a math student at MIT, Theriault-Shay was thorough and never took the easy way out, according to professor Bjorn Poonen. Theriault-Shay once encountered a confusing passage in the class textbook, written by one of the world's most renowned mathematicians. Poonen said that while most students might have skipped over it, he flagged it — and with good reason, it turned out: "There was an error in the book!" He applied to intern at quant hedge fund D.E. Shaw and stood out among an "extremely competitive applicant pool," one person who interviewed him said. After graduating in 2019, he started at Shaw full-time in its macro unit, researching and trading currencies and emerging-market rates, especially in Asia. "He has this inner, deep desire to figure out the truth and figure out what's really going on in markets," a former colleague said, adding that Theriault-Shay would get almost "giddy" about esoteric aspects of the market. Theriault-Shay had a penchant for disappearing down rabbit holes in individual countries and companies and resurfacing with insights sharp enough to nudge the group's thinking on some of its currency positions — an impressive feat for a junior, they said. Theriault-Shay was poached in 2021 by Citadel, joining as an associate PM in the group run by vaunted bond basis trader Jon Tipermas. Within two years, he was promoted to portfolio manager and now runs a small team. Theriault-Shay thrives on shoe-leather research, traveling to Asia multiple times a year to inform his trades. "He loves being on the ground and getting a sense of the local flavor and talking to people in Asia about markets," the former colleague said. Citadel declined to comment or make Theriault-Shay available for an interview. Just days into her new role as chief of staff to Larry Fink, Catherine Kress is already feeling the faster pace, she told Business Insider. The post puts her at the center of the world's largest asset manager — gatekeeper to BlackRock's cofounder and CEO, and offers what excites her most: "unparalleled exposure" to global business leaders and policymakers. Kress long knew she wanted a career at the "intersection of geopolitics, policy, economies, and markets." Until recently, she was BlackRock's head of geopolitics and research, unpacking issues from the AI race to trade protectionism and sharing them at conferences, boardrooms, and in meetings with major C-suite leaders. She helped turn the $12.5 trillion firm's first geopolitics team, led by former US national security advisor Tom Donilon, into a permanent fixture within the BlackRock Investment Institute. When she applied to be Donilon's advisor, she called it a "dream job" — even asking her husband to confirm the posting was real. Demand for her team's insights surged after the COVID pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as clients "realized national security and resilience concerns were increasingly taking priority or at least on par with pure cost efficiency and market objectives," she said. A psychology and anthropology major at the University of Notre Dame, she conducted fieldwork in Sierra Leone and pursued graduate research in Angola's energy sector at Oxford as a Clarendon scholar. She thought she might pursue a Ph.D. until a mentor urged her to apply her work in the private sector. Before joining BlackRock in 2018, she worked closely with Ian Bremmer, the political scientist and the founder of Eurasia Group, where she led training sessions on integrating geopolitical risk thinking with investing. She credits academia with teaching her to ground every view in facts, "never shooting from the hip," and for instilling in her the confidence to brief everyone from investors to world leaders. Now, as Fink's chief of staff and a mother to two young boys, she's entering what she calls the "culmination" of her career. A decade ago, while living in New Delhi and before he had ever set foot in the US, Nikunj Jain spent his free time Googling which colleges offered the best computer science programs. Now, after graduating from the University of California-Berkeley in two and a half years, he's the head of Asia research for Bridgewater, the world's largest hedge fund with $98 billion. Jain credits his rapid journey to the upper echelon of finance to a mix of persistence, strong familial support, and internal mentors, including the firm's co-chief investment officer, Karen Karniol-Tambour. From New York, Jain helps Bridgewater steer its coverage of all things Asia, where its flagship fund trades securities and its China-based funds have become a go-to investment for the country's elite. It's the type of day-to-day excitement and challenge that drew the 27-year-old to finance in the first place. After graduating, he studied machine learning, taught undergraduates math, interned for Apple, and worked for the Department of Defense, but found the Bay Area "a little slower than I would have liked." A friend suggested quantitative finance, leading him to apply to Bridgewater, the systematic investment manager founded 50 years ago by billionaire Ray Dalio, which has returned 26.4% in its flagship fund through September this year. He spent time focused on equities and fixed income, but in his current role, geography is the only boundary. His 15- to 20-person team, depending on the subject matter of the day, synthesizes activities across Asia into trading signals for Bridgewater's strategies. Jain sees macro investing as the culmination of answering "one of the toughest intellectual challenges." Asian markets, in particular, can be a puzzle thanks to relatively less reliable economic data. Jain's team stays on top of the latest shifts with a blend of quantitative know-how and "old-school macro investing practices," such as on-the-ground research and knowledge. Bridgewater has offices in Singapore and China, and Jain tries to visit the continent often. Seven years in, Jain says he has found a home in the industry: "I love the world of investing." From running multibillion-dollar books to navigating volatile markets, these young standouts are central to how their firms make money and manage risk. At hedge funds specifically, the battle for talent remains fierce. Some declined to make their stars available for interviews. When COVID shut down the world in 2020 and Manhattan offices emptied as workers isolated at home, distressed credit trader Jake Woodson was on a skeleton crew that never left Goldman Sachs' trading floor. It felt unusual at the time, but having the opportunity to navigate once-in-a-lifetime swings in airlines, retailers, and car-rental companies was "a blessing in disguise," says Woodson. "You can end up learning in a few weeks, or a couple months, more than in certain years," Woodson said. A couple of years later, he was promoted to his current role as head of US distressed credit trading. Shortly after, he navigated the 2023 banking crisis, generating tens of millions in profits for the firm — a seminal moment in his career. Woodson's unlikely path started at the University of British Columbia — hardly a recruiting target for US investment banks. There, he pulled off an impressive feat: he became the first varsity football player — and second athlete ever — admitted to the school's Portfolio Management Foundation, an intensive training program founded in the 1980s, in which a select group of students help manage a multimillion-dollar endowment. He started full-time at Goldman in 2014 in investment-grade credit, though he knew he eventually wanted to trade riskier securities. A year later, he jumped at an opportunity to work in junk bonds under Thomas Malafronte, who's now a PM at Millennium. Woodson earned a reputation as a reliable, insightful, and generous trading partner. He's "trustworthy and honest" and "people love working for and with him," one buy-side client said. "You'd rather be respected than liked, but he does things the right way and is in a special category where he's both," said Malafronte. Woodson presses his team of around 10, including traders and researchers, not just to identify mispricings, but to figure out what's behind the inefficiency — a forced seller or herd bias against a business model or company? (Goldman declined to comment on team head count.) "When things seem too obvious, they probably are," he added. Under his leadership, Goldman's US distressed team has ranked third in industry league tables for the past two years and is ranked No. 2 so far in 2025, according to Vali Analytics. Ilya Katz, the new portfolio manager for Citadel's Ashler Capital unit, has spent his short career investing for several billionaires. Katz, who has two degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, started at Steve Cohen's Point72 in 2016. He worked as an analyst for a team trading healthcare stocks — including companies that manufacture medical devices — that managed a book of more than $2 billion, according to his LinkedIn profile. He joined Cowen as the firm's head of healthcare data in 2019, prior to TD Bank's acquisition of the New York-based financial services company. He then rejoined the buy side, trading for London billionaires Ian Wace and Paul Marshall at their self-named megafund. There, Katz worked under healthcare portfolio manager Vijay Shankaran, who managed money for the firm's Eureka fund, a person familiar with the asset manager told Business Insider. He started as an analyst, blending quantitative tools with fundamental research to find opportunities in therapeutics and medical technology companies. He was given his own sleeve of capital to run under Shankaran, this person said, managing some of Marshall Wace's billions before being poached by Ken Griffin at the end of last year. Now at Ashler, Citadel's equities unit, his pod naturally focuses on the healthcare space, where he's been able to lean on his science background: He has a master's in biotechnology and an undergraduate degree from Penn's competitive Wharton program in economics. Even in the ultra-competitive world of multistrategy hedge funds, where every portfolio manager and analyst seemingly has an Ivy League degree and a sterling résumé, Katz stands out. One word an Ashler colleague used to describe the under-30 trader: savant. Christian Woo likens his work to building a Formula 1 car engine: The technology team provides the raw materials, the traders are the drivers, and his job is designing the machinery that makes everything run faster. At Bank of America, Woo is a managing director and who leads the credit systematic trading strategies team. They conduct quantitative research and develop a credit market-making algorithm, which handles smaller electronic inquiries and spreads risk from big client orders. Since joining in 2019, Woo has helped grow the bank's algorithm-based electronic trading volume in investment-grade credit fivefold. He said that it's been gratifying to see everyone's work "compound" as it continues to expand, especially since he was involved from the very beginning. Woo's team designs the algorithms that enable traders to quote bonds autonomously, manage risk after large portfolio trades, and process thousands of trades simultaneously — a leap from just a few years ago. That progress also reflects a broader market trend as Woo points out: Today, more than half of all corporate bond trading is done electronically, up from roughly 20% a decade ago. Honolulu isn't a traditional Wall Street launchpad, but his father, a wealth manager, exposed Woo to markets early, bringing him along to meet with clients across the Hawaiian islands. After starting on Citi's credit trading desk in 2015 in New York City, where he's based, he moved to Bank of America in 2019 and dove into electronic credit trading. He credits his drive to his mother, a nurse and healthcare worker who threw herself into every endeavor — including her passions such as pickleball and her stint in entrepreneurship. "She goes all in on things and commits very hard, and it's something I find that I do, as well," he said. He approaches his work the same way: tackling problems with curiosity and persistence. A mantra from Einstein has guided his career: "I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious." In the cutthroat world of hedge funds, especially at the multistrategy giants that have come to rule the industry, there's not much upside for portfolio managers to be a sounding board for others. Colleagues, much less people at rival funds, can be slow to share wisdom or hacks for fear of losing their own edge. Everyone is, more or less, competing against everyone else at all times. It's one of the reasons John Huh stands out. Huh, a portfolio manager at $14 billion Schonfeld Strategic Advisors, is a talented investor and a strong mentor for younger colleagues, according to those who know him. After graduating from New York University's Stern School of Business in 2012, he worked at Wells Fargo in equity research and then moved to the buy side in 2015. He joined Point72 in 2016, when it was trading its founder's cash and before it officially reopened to outside investors. He worked as an analyst covering stocks in the telecommunications, media, technology, and internet sectors through the firm's 2018 relaunch, and left the following year to join Schonfeld. Huh worked under Simon Silverston as an associate portfolio manager before being promoted at the end of last year to run his own team. Still specializing in technology, media, and telecommunications, Huh is a go-to source for many young stockpickers at the firm with questions or problems, according to one individual who works at the New York-based manager. Wall Street is constantly looking for an edge, which means firms are always racing to create new products and tools that give them — and their clients — an advantage. Whether it's reimagining how bonds are traded or bringing complex products like CLOs and tokenized funds to a broader investor base, these rising stars show how fresh ideas can quickly scale into breakthroughs that reshape markets. Sarah Naylor wanted to be in the room where decisions were made. After six years in investment-grade bond sales at big banks, she knew that room was usually reserved for senior staff. So when Citadel Securities tapped her in 2024 to help launch its corporate bond trading business, she jumped at what she called a "once-in-a-career" opportunity. Her readiness for that leap traces back to a turning point a few years in at Citigroup, which she joined in 2016 after graduating from Colgate. A senior salesman covering a major asset manager departed, and Naylor was asked to temporarily oversee the account. Lacking experience, she compensated with preparation — studying the client's portfolio and grilling traders for insights. Citi's standing improved, and she kept the account permanently. The episode shaped her philosophy to be an "internal expert" on her client. "I try to hold myself to the standard that anytime anyone internally has a question pertaining to my client, I should have the answer," Naylor said. One of her mentors at Citi, Sam Berberian, recruited her to Citadel Securities after he joined as head of credit trading in 2023. She joined the buildout in early 2024 and quickly found herself "in the room," weighing in on key decisions. One objective for the team has been tackling the "gray market," the window when newly announced bonds trade before official issuance. Citadel Securities views that period as critical for clients, but historically inefficient, since banks can't immediately resell the bonds they've issued, and pricing is often fragmented and handled over the phone. Naylor pitched Berberian an idea: a tool that would stream live data and pricing from Citadel Securities. Working across teams, Naylor helped propel that idea to reality this September with the launch of the "Gray Trading Panel" on Bloomberg terminals. The impact has been swift, she said. A large asset manager executed its first gray market trade, block trades increased, and market share ticked up. "I have learned more in the last 18 months than I had in my entire career combined," Naylor said. Jessica Shill didn't know she'd be working with niche CLO ETFs when she took a job with Janus Henderson in August of 2019. But shortly after she joined, that became a focus, bringing a traditionally opaque product for institutions to mainstream investors. Her team has grown to more than 20 people, and she's now a portfolio manager of three ETFs overseeing a combined $24.3 billion in assets. "Launching and management of the ETFs are definitely the keystone moments of my career," Shill said. She recently helped launch and develop the strategy of Janus' first tokenized fund — which has gathered nearly $800 million in assets since its June debut — and thinks blockchain will help asset management become more efficient. Shill credits her success to her diligence, such as rotating out of a bond as soon as she becomes uncomfortable holding it, and believes that the best choices are often the hardest ones. She's worked through "some pretty turbulent markets," like COVID, and thinks her ability to raise capital and willingness to "grind out sales" during that time helped prove her chops to management. "I am a firm believer in measure twice, cut once. Honestly, at work, it turns into measuring three or four times and cutting once," Shill said about her process for evaluating each bond. "As long as you're never trying to cut your corners, over time, you become confident." Shill, who didn't grow up in a family with Wall Street ties, said finance has been a good fit in part because it's "intellectually stimulating." The Maine native studied at Bryn Mawr College and spent two years at Wells Fargo before joining Janus in Denver. Since she works market hours but lives on Mountain Time, Shill begins her days early and typically has some time after work. In the summer, she'll often go for a bike ride before cooking dinner for herself and her husband and, no matter the season, reading for a bit before going to sleep.Interactive development by Randy Yeip.Corrections: October 6, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated Joe Slevin's age.

They're still in the early innings of their careers, but these dealmakers and investors are already setting the agenda for the next era of finance. Each year, Business Insider spotlights up-and-coming Wall Streeters who are making an outsize impact in investing, trading, and dealmaking. The process starts with nominations from bosses, colleagues, recruiters, and other industry insiders. To be considered, nominees must be US-based, 35 or younger, and stand out among their peers. Business Insider's editors make the final selections. This year's class reflects some of the hottest areas of the industry, from private credit to advising on multibillion-dollar data center deals. They come from powerhouse firms like JPMorgan, Apollo, Citadel, and Bridgewater. One was recently promoted to chief of staff to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Meet the 25 newest inductees to Business Insider's annual list of young people who exemplify the drive and creativity needed to succeed in one of the most competitive industries in the world. After a slow start to the year amid uncertainty over tariffs, geopolitical risks, and recession fears, dealmaking is regaining momentum. Bankers and private-equity investors are finding their stride, driving major IPOs, carve-outs, and buyouts. Here are some top dealmakers to watch. Jack Levendoski is riding the rebound in M&A after a rocky start to the year. An executive director in JPMorgan's M&A group, he has worked on some of 2025's largest technology transactions, including Palo Alto Networks' $25 billion acquisition of CyberArk and Xero's $2.5 billion purchase of Melio. After a choppy first half marked by rate uncertainty and geopolitical risk, he says the market now "feels extremely busy." He's used to big-ticket transactions: In 2022, Levendoski was part of Twitter's $44 billion sale to Elon Musk, a transaction that unfolded under global scrutiny. "The pace at which that all happened, the level of public scrutiny‚ it was pretty amazing," he told Business Insider. He also worked on Squarespace's $6.9 billion take-private with Permira in 2024, Savvy Gaming Group's $4.9 billion acquisition of Scopely in 2023, and the merger of World Wrestling Entertainment and UFC, valued at about $21 billion. Levendoski's father worked in oil and gas, and the family moved often, living in Louisiana, London, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Australia. "Growing up where the environment was always changing and kind of always finding your feet and figuring it out," he says, adding that it also gave him an appreciation for different viewpoints and the ability to adapt quickly. That flexibility has been essential across more than $300 billion in deal value he has advised on. Artificial intelligence has been a recurring theme in recent deals, in how companies are valued and in how bankers operate. Being an early adopter has given Levendoski "quick answers to hard questions that perhaps before required significant research," he said. After starting his career at Chevron, where he worked as a facilities engineering project manager, Levendoski joined JPMorgan in 2016, supporting capital projects and offshore oil and gas projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Having benefited from mentors early on, he now tries to do the same for others: "I saw the value that it created for me, and so I've tried to play that forward." Mary-Grace Papatheodorou worked on her first IPO in 2012, as an analyst on Jefferies' equity capital markets desk. She remembers watching in awe as the woman running Manchester United's equity syndicate negotiated prices and stake sizes with hungry investors. "I remember thinking to myself at the time, wow, that's the coolest job I've ever seen," Papatheodorou told Business Insider. She went right up and asked if she could join the equity syndicate team. Years later, she thinks that directness was a secret weapon that has helped propel her up the ranks. Today, she's a managing director on Morgan Stanley's global capital markets' equity syndicate desk. "I have to ask investors to step on price or to accept smaller or larger allocations to move the demand. You have to ask — the worst that can happen is someone says no, and at least then you know your answer," she said. "It's tough to put yourself out there, but it's a lot worse not to." Papatheodorou spent nearly 10 years at Jefferies before joining Morgan Stanley in 2021. She managed the equity syndicates of some of this year's highest-profile IPOs, including Figma, Chime, and CoreWeave. Her role, she admits, is "incredibly high pressure." Her calls on price, sizing, and risk can dictate how a stock trades the very next day. Making those calls is also part of the fun, she said. Like the markets, her job is always evolving. She doesn't get a lot of sleep when IPO season is in full swing. Now on maternity leave after giving birth to her first child in August, she's embraced a similar routine. "Having a child is a little bit of a different animal, but equally as demanding as some of our clients," she joked. As a principal investing in sports teams for Blue Owl, Lamar Cardinez is living a version of his dreams he didn't know was possible. Cardinez had ambitions to play professional football, but when that didn't happen, he pivoted to working in sports — interning at Madison Square Garden and joining the 2014 Super Bowl host committee. That led him to the National Football League's rotational program, where he worked in media, business development, and strategy. He planned to climb the ladder there, then realized that the work he was most interested in was reserved for those with finance backgrounds. Encouraged by longtime NFL executive and ex-Goldman Sachs banker Eric Grubman, Cardinez pursued an MBA at Cornell before landing in investment banking at Guggenheim Securities. Then came a fateful call from Dyal Capital Partners (soon to become Blue Owl). The firm had just launched HomeCourt Partners, a fund partnership with the National Basketball Association, to buy minority stakes in teams. It was a "no-brainer" for him, he said. Cardinez joined in 2021, shortly after the fund's first investment in the Phoenix Suns, then valued at $1.55 billion. He later worked on the franchise's $4 billion sale to mortgage magnate Mat Ishbia in 2022 and has since contributed to four more NBA deals — a period during which the average value of an NBA team nearly doubled, according to Blue Owl. He sources potential deals by "hanging around the hoop" and getting to know the league's hundreds of minority investors and would-be buyers. His team spent two years engaging with Alex Rodriguez's consortium before striking a 2024 deal for the Minnesota Timberwolves. Cardinez's skill in underwriting sports teams as they turn from "vanity and trophy assets" to money-makers is built on his operational knowledge of sports and his financial expertise. His blueprint for valuation has since been replicated across sports leagues and geographies, the firm said. Golf was Jackie Shepherd's training for Wall Street. She was a competitive player from age 7 through college, where she earned a full-ride scholarship and was a two-time captain of the University of Minnesota team. Though she dreamed of turning pro, Shepherd carried over her patience and precision to a career advising companies on breaking out parts of their business. "Golf is all about strategy," she said. "I think a lot of that really translated over to the separations work that I do, where it's very detailed, you really have to get into the weeds, it's hyper strategy focused — and these are really long lead time transactions." Shepherd is a vice president in Morgan Stanley's Separations and Structured Solutions group, which specializes in helping companies transform subsidiaries into standalone entities. She has advised on about $250 billion worth of corporate spin-offs, including Comcast's pending carve-out of its cable networks into Versant Media Group. She says it's a "unique way" for Comcast to become more focused on where the future of media is going. The goal with the deals she works on is to "disentangle" businesses that don't make sense together but are strong and "have agendas that they want to do on their own." Shepherd started her career in accounting on EY's international tax team, where she first saw the work of investment bankers up close. "I didn't realize that there was an intersection between the two," she said. "I wanted to be the person coming up with more of the cool ideas." She restarted her career in M&A and was recruited as an analyst by Goldman, where she found her mentor, Michael Kagan; she later followed him to Citi and Morgan Stanley, which she joined in 2023. Shepherd still plays golf, and her goal is to play on all seven continents. Asia was checked off last summer: "My golf clubs have seen a lot of airline miles." In 2022, Florian Plath got a call from one of his bosses at JPMorgan Chase with an assignment: Join the deal team on Broadcom's $90 billion acquisition of VMware, one of the largest tech acquisitions in history. It was a pivotal and fast-moving experience for the banker, who's since advised on other multibillion-dollar transactions, including Altair's $10.6 billion sale to Siemens and Altium's $6 billion sale to Renesas. Earlier in his career, he worked on Maxim Integrated's $29 billion all-stock merger with Analog Devices — one of the largest semiconductor transactions on record. Plath started at JPMorgan as an intern in the London office. Today, he is an executive director and top advisor in its mergers and acquisitions group, working with leading technology clients. Reflecting on these deals, Plath said the constant across them is how quickly teams must mobilize and solve problems in dynamic markets — especially those as ever-changing as the tech sector. He has observed that strategic corporate buyers, after a quieter stretch, have recently begun revving the engine of dealmaking activity again — especially around AI and software — while private equity sponsors continue to search for bargain buys. Plath is based in San Francisco, and the native of Germany has studied in Asia and lived in London, so he's formed a global worldview. He moved to California in 2018. "Right from the start, I knew I wanted to, at some point if the opportunity arose, to live and work in the US," he said, pointing to its position as the leading capital market. His international upbringing, he added, "further sparked my interest in global markets." At JPMorgan, he has also served as a staffer — the linchpin for team coordination — for the North America analyst and associate program, working hand-in-hand with junior bankers on the front lines of deal teams. An avid runner who also enjoys golf and tennis, he credits sports with keeping him grounded in a high-pressure business. "For me, it has always been a team sport," he said, "doing what's right for our clients, the firm, and the employees." From working as a Radio Disney DJ through middle and high school to graduating in the top 5% of her Harvard Business School MBA class as a Baker Scholar, Natalie Lamberton has long been a high achiever with an entrepreneurial streak. It makes sense she's found success at GTCR, the Chicago-based private equity firm where she became one of its youngest directors. "I can chase whatever opportunities I like, which is motivating," she told Business Insider. As an associate in 2016, she played a key role in GTCR's $500 million investment in Lytx, a global leader in video telematics, together with a firm partner. Two years later, GTCR sold a stake in the company, whose valuation had more than tripled to $1.7 billion, to a Clearlake Capital—led investor group. Lamberton joined GTCR after starting her career at Goldman Sachs in leveraged finance. She's since worked on over a dozen deals, including the 2023 acquisition of Once For All, a construction supply chain platform. She helped bring on a new CEO — a key part of GTCR's playbook — and later spearheaded its 2024 expansion into Spain with the acquisition of Nalanda. Returning from parental leave after the birth of her first child in March, Lamberton is focused on vertical software across government technology, supply chain, and workforce tools — and how AI can help portfolio companies achieve their goals more efficiently. "It helps us accelerate our development road map materially," she said. Her father, a salesman in the industrial sector, taught her to approach challenges with curiosity rather than a fear of failure. That has allowed her to walk into situations with the mindset of "why not try to apply myself and see what happens." Lamberton nearly pursued theater before choosing Wharton for undergrad. The “calculated risk taker” in her decided a career onstage wasn’t the right fit. She'd love to get back into it at some point, but right now her performances are reserved for her 6-month-old daughter in their kitchen. Infrastructure has become one of Wall Street's hottest bets. Investors are pouring billions into everything from power grids and data centers to roads and airports, fueling the AI boom and energy transition while upgrading aging assets. Investor assets in private infrastructure funds have soared to $1.5 trillion in 2024 from $500 billion in 2016, according to McKinsey. Meet some of the names you should know as the space continues to gain momentum. The data center industry has become a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity that has transfixed Wall Street. Aman Mittal, a managing director at Moelis & Company, is helping the storied advisory firm establish itself as a leading player in the mergers and acquisitions, investments, and debt deals that are fast shaping the sector. The 35-year-old advised the data center company Core Scientific on its announced $9 billion sale to CoreWeave and worked with Apollo on its deal to buy a majority stake in the data center developer and operator Stream Data Centers. He also helped another large data center platform, Prime Data Centers, arrange the sale of an undisclosed ownership stake in it to institutional investors Snowhawk and Nuveen. And that was just over the summer. In the past three years, Mittal has worked on more than 15 data center-related transactions with a total deal value exceeding $25 billion. Mittal got his start studying electronics and communications engineering in his home country of India before getting an MBA at the NYU Stern School of Business. He began as an analyst at Bain & Company in technology, media, and telecom, before moving to Evercore to advise in those sectors. In 2022, he joined Moelis to help lead its growing practice in the booming digital infrastructure space, particularly data center deals. Mittal said that he keeps his focus straightforward: knowing his clients and anticipating the solutions that match their business needs. "The idea is that you need to know what is important to the company and the company needs to feel comfortable about sharing their constantly changing objectives with you," Mittal said. "My position is like: this is what you're doing, and this could become better if you do this also." Mittal starts his day by jotting down three Post-it notes outlining his priorities. He ends every day with a call, "that is not related to my immediate tasks." "I'll just reach out to someone I have not talked to in three months or six months," Mittal said. "To reconnect with potential possibilities." A demanding career on Wall Street requires resilience, a quality that Arting Chang had mastered before she landed in the industry. As an eighth grader, her father's investment banking job moved her and her family from Taiwan to California. Before that, her family had lived in Shanghai and Tokyo. The frequent moves taught her to be adaptable in a way that helped her career. "I think I have a way of talking to myself very kindly and giving myself encouragement to be like — you know how to do this, you've done this, you've been in more chaotic environments," she said. Now a vice president at Advent International, a private equity firm that manages $94 billion, Chang has emerged as a young star in its industrials team. She helped lead Advent's $1 billion acquisition of LayerZero Power Systems, a producer of data-center power equipment, earlier this year. Chang co-launched Advent's first dedicated data-center sourcing effort. The team built a bottom-up model of how growth would unfold, assembled a bench of executives, and networked with regional, niche bankers so that they'd come to her when deals arose. The introduction to LayerZero came through a relationship at Citizens Bank, months before a formal sale process began. Chang said she's a "big proponent of always getting on the ground." At AEA Investors, where she worked before Advent, she spent a year in Dallas helping prepare retailer At Home for its IPO. While digging into LayerZero, time at the Ohio headquarters revealed an opportunity for an expansion that became central to the deal. She still visits monthly for board meetings. Off the clock, Chang is a regular at Barry's Bootcamp, a restaurant lover, and a proud collector of 50-plus statement blazers. She sits on the steering committee for Advent's LGBTQ+ employee resource group and is the youngest board member of Out for Undergrad, a nonprofit that helps LGBTQ+ college students explore careers in finance and other competitive industries. When Mohini Chakravorty joined Blackstone Infrastructure in 2019, the team had around $5 billion in assets and only a handful of staff. Five years later, a team of around 100 manages $64 billion — and she's had a front-row seat to explosive growth that has shaped her career. "It's been just a wild ride. It's really rare to see that kind of growth and that kind of rapid evolution," Chakravorty said. Chakravorty's first stop after Wharton was Bank of America, where she followed her older brother into investment banking. It wasn't surprising to anyone, as he'd always been a role model, she said, but she quickly found herself drawn more to private equity. Since joining Blackstone, Chakravorty has contributed to more than $16 billion in transactions across the infrastructure sector. One key moment came when she helped acquire a stake in Phoenix Tower International in 2022, the biggest private cellphone tower platform in Europe and the Americas. Chakravorty credits much of her success to keeping a positive attitude, even when making rapid and stressful judgment calls. She remembers when, minutes before a key meeting, her team identified a downside scenario they needed to review. Even with the time crunch, Chakravorty helped create a straightforward analytical approach to quantify the potential problem, which became the focus of the discussion. The same composure came into play when she helped acquire the largest yacht and marina servicing company, Safe Harbor Marinas, for $5.6 billion on a "very accelerated" timeline earlier this year. Much of Chakravorty's job involves relationship-building, which comes easily since she's a natural extrovert. Chakravorty also focuses on showing other young women who are interested in investing that there's room for them in the profession. "The advice that I tell myself and give to young women is to run towards what scares you. Facing challenges head-on helps you break down some of those roadblocks," she said. Benson Kane was in seventh grade in Weston, Connecticut, when the 2008 financial crisis hit, and he remembers being fascinated by the underpinnings of the unfolding calamity. "All of a sudden, this big event happened and I was interested in understanding what this was and how it had such a massive impact on the broader world," Kane said. Throughout middle and high school, his interest in debt and credit persisted. He avidly followed Elliott Investment Management's efforts in the news to collect on its investment in Argentine bonds that the country had defaulted on. After studying finance at Brigham Young University, Kane joined Angelo Gordon in 2020, which became part of TPG in 2023. He's now a vice president on its credit solutions team. The group focuses on extending debt and providing other capital solutions to companies that often face financial distress or complex business challenges. Kane focuses on companies in the chemicals and materials manufacturing sectors, as well as those involved in energy infrastructure, including power plants and pipelines. "I love complex problems, trying to figure them out," Kane said. In 2023, for instance, Kane, 29, worked on a $1 billion-plus loan provided to Trinseo, a materials company, funded by TPG, Oaktree Capital, and Apollo. "We were able to provide liquidity to a company in need of it and that wasn't able to get it from other sources, and we were able to preserve the business," Kane said, explaining that the company and others like it in the materials and chemicals industries had been hit by a downturn in demand post-pandemic. Kane is excelling in a newer world of distressed credit where, he said, there is often a more congenial relationship between lenders and borrowers. "We're working in a much more collaborative fashion, trying to be solutions providers, a little bit less sharp-elbowed maybe than the past," Kane said. "Relationships matter, reputations matter. People want to work with people that are good to work with in terms of company." The growth of private markets has reshaped Wall Street, turning private equity, credit, and secondaries into some of the most dynamic parts of finance. Behind the growth is a new generation of talent driving major buyouts, capital raises, and fund innovations. Meet the rising stars helping define the strategies and structures that will shape how trillions of dollars flow through global markets. Private credit's first iteration was all about lending to companies that do not have access to traditional bank financing. Now, private credit 2.0 — the shift to customizing loans for investment-grade companies — is on the rise, and Madelaine O'Connell is helping write the playbook. O'Connell is a managing director in HPS' $25 billion private high-grade business. Her team designs creative alternatives to issuing a plain-vanilla bond, such as helping a Fortune 500 company finance a new project through a joint venture — keeping the debt off its balance sheet while giving investors, like insurers, a steady return. She thinks the industry has "just scratched the surface" of structuring bespoke deals that can't be found in the public bond market, she told Business Insider. "Every transaction we work on has nuances that have definitely pushed me personally to think outside the box," she said. O'Connell began her career at Citi in the securitized products division before Goldman Sachs tapped her and her then-boss to help rebuild its private placement franchise, which had been dormant since the 1990s. She said the effort was like a "de-risked startup," integrating with investment-banking teams, winning trust deal by deal, and building relationships on the buy side. She led the team from 2020, and by the time she left in 2024, it was lending to fund managers and lending against esoteric assets like media rights. They were also early to financing data centers — something that was cutting-edge at the time, she said. The explosive growth in private credit was "very much the thesis" behind her move to HPS, which the $12.5 trillion asset manager BlackRock acquired in July, giving her team even more firepower. A lifelong dancer, O'Connell began teaching fitness classes at Boston College and even led 6 a.m. Pilates sessions while working as an investment banker. She still teaches online occasionally when travel allows. "Working out is just as important to my mental health as it is to my physical health," she said. In Knut Kirchhoff's nine years of working in private credit, the segment has grown to become one of the hottest places for young job seekers in finance. As a leader of the analyst and associate recruiting efforts for Blackstone's Credit and Insurance team, he's seen this transformation firsthand. At a Georgetown recruiting event that drew more than 100 students, Kirchoff had nonstop conversations about private credit and "lost my voice by the end of the night," he said. A Norwegian who attended Boston University for college, Kirchoff began his career on Citi's leveraged finance team. He quickly became fascinated with the world of debt, and after two years, he realized he wanted to move to the buy side. His interest was piqued by a few successful deals that Blackstone Credit (then GSO) did with Citi during a period of energy price volatility in 2015. When he joined Blackstone in 2016, the firm's credit unit had roughly $80 billion in assets. It has since swelled to over $400 billion, becoming the firm's largest and fastest-growing business. "The first deal I did was $125 million," Kirchoff said. "Now we're doing billion-dollar deals almost every single week." Last year, Kirchoff helped create the professional services vertical, lending to consulting and accounting firms. The team, which Kirchoff now leads, has made over $10 billion in credit investments. The deal that catapulted his career occurred early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when Kirchoff was tapped to work on lending to cruise lines. As some deals were launching, the leading managing director went on paternity leave, leaving Kirchoff to step into a leadership position. "I had been promoted four months earlier and was working from home, and now had the responsibility of a team under me," Kirchoff said. He led diligence on the deal and brought it through the investment committee. Blackstone's purchase of the cruise line debt "ended up being a really good transaction for the firm," Kirchoff said. Patrick Kearney has developed a specialty for buying airlines and packaging companies during his eight years at Apollo. It's a product of Apollo's "generalist" model, the principal told Business Insider, which has new hires rotate through different business units and industries. His first deal was the 2018 acquisition of Sun Country Airlines, and aviation has been a constant since. Airline ownership allows Kearney to flex his business-building muscles — navigating Trump's tariffs, investing in more aircraft, and modernizing operations at a portfolio company, Atlas Air. "There's never a dull day when you own an airline in terms of the problems that you have to solve," he said. And even though he's based in the firm's flagship private equity arm, he still works closely with Apollo's ground-breaking credit team. "We don't have any walls at Apollo," he said about the firm he joined in 2017 after spending two years at Moelis & Company. Credit and equity teams share research, insights, expertise, and even deals. The credit side can help make equity investments possible when financing is tight, such as with the firm's 2022 $5.2 billion take-private of cargo airline Atlas Air, Kearney said. "We financed Atlas when the financing markets, frankly, were not open," Kearney said. Kearney's work on the 2022 acquisition of Novolex and the 2025 combination with Pactiv, both food packaging businesses, is another example of his ability to grow companies. When Kearney and his team initially considered Novolex, they evaluated what the combined business would look like with Pactiv, given their complementary products. It didn't pan out, but at the end of last year, Novolex announced it would acquire Pactiv, with the deal expected to close this year. "It's rare to have something like that in your original investment committee dialogue and actually have it come to fruition," Kearney said. The first deal of Alex Park's career was far from the sleek software buyouts he's versed in now — it was a Chapter 11 bankruptcy for a school bus company that he happened to use as a kid. "Buses were stolen out of the parking lot in Staten Island, and I actually had to work with the local police force to try and locate these buses," he laughed. That experience sparked his interest in working in credit: "I wanted to see what a healthy and growing company looked like." That realization carried Park from restructuring at Rothschild to Ares Management, and ultimately to Thoma Bravo, where he joined the credit team shortly after its inception in 2019. Now a principal, he's helped the credit team invest more than $8 billion across about 100 transactions. Miami-based Park is "incredibly proud" of sourcing and leading financing for Blackstone's acquisition of Irth Solutions in 2021 and Warburg Pincus' financing of Softeon in 2023 — two "best in class" SaaS companies, he said. "Everyone wants to lead deals for these sponsors," Park said. While Thoma Bravo's credit team has been well established, it's "still relatively new" compared to some players, he noted. Outside of investing, Park has played a key role in fundraising, including helping to complete the $3.6 billion Credit Fund III, the platform's largest pool of capital to date, in early 2025. He credits his career success to a "chip on my shoulder" work ethic, a love of building relationships, and especially a commitment to mentorship. In fact, a banker from Rothschild, Brendan Fox, who took him "under his wing," is on his team at Thoma. He said a number of colleagues "played such a formative role in shaping me that I always wanted to pay that forward going forward." Today, Park leads recruiting for the credit team, creating an "open-door" culture for juniors: "I want you to feel comfortable asking me anything and everything — no dumb questions." When Joe Slevin started specializing in the resale market of private equity stakes in 2015, it was a niche that "barely existed," he told Business Insider. Now, secondary deals are on the rise — with a record $103 billion worth of activity completed globally in the first six months of 2025, according to Jefferies. UK-native Slevin started his career as a JPMorgan investment banker in London, then sought "an area of finance where there was huge growth potential," that was "off the beaten path." He joined Coller Capital, a pioneer in what was then the nascent secondaries industry. After three years on the buy side, Slevin returned to banking to advise investors on secondary transactions at PJT Partners and Guggenheim Partners because, he said, he preferred being "at the center of things between all the stakeholders in a transaction." He said his time on the buy side made him a better advisor since he had to bring "extremely nuanced" deals through investment committees. In 2021, he joined Jefferies to cofound their Private Capital Advisory team, which now has more than 120 members and advises investors on selling some of their private portfolios to other investors and fund operators on spinning out select assets into new funds. In the first half of this year, the PCA team advised on over $31 billion in secondary transactions. Slevin focuses on deals led by private equity or credit operators, recently working with ONCAP, Gryphon Partners, and Trinity Ventures. The most well-known version of this is a continuation fund, which is set up to buy one or more assets they already own — giving liquidity to investors who need it while continuing to wring returns out of assets. This segment of the industry has experienced a surge in popularity in recent years, as private equity distributions have fallen short of expectations. Earlier this year, Slevin moved to Los Angeles from New York to expand his team's geographic reach, focusing on West Coast private equity and venture capital operators. About four years ago, Josef Menasche was working at a boutique secondaries firm on a deal alongside Goldman Sachs bankers. He came away convinced that his industry, which deals in sales of private fund stakes, was headed for change. "My whole thesis was big banks are going to dominate this space eventually," he said. So he called Goldman and said, "Hey, you should just hire me because we already had a great working dynamic on this deal. Wouldn't it be better if we were actually working together?" He joined the bank's secondaries business at the end of 2021 and today is a managing director and global cohead of secondaries advisory. He said 2025 has been a turning point, following several years of caution among investors regarding capital commitments. "The level of creativity that we've seen in 2025 has been really, really exciting to work with," he said — a sign that the market is picking up. His team has executed transactions across infrastructure, real estate, private equity, and venture capital. The highlights include a $3.1 billion single-asset continuation vehicle — allowing a private equity firm to extend its investment in a company — with New Mountain Capital for Real Chemistry. "Half of it was providing the distribution to original investors, half was actually primary capital for future M&A, which is pretty unusual," he said. "The fact that they're willing to put so much fresh money into the new M&A through another business is pretty unusual. It's a general sign of people feeling good about the world." His team has just over a dozen bankers, compared with about 150 at its largest competitor, he said. Clients often tell him: "You give us very different advice to other bankers, and it seems to work out well for us." Menasche studied chemistry at Cambridge. He found the lab environment too slow and shifted into finance. Early experience at secondaries-focused boutique Campbell Lutyens gave him a foothold in the industry. "I think fundamentally, if you just pick what you're interested in, you will do well," he said. ​​Reading the tea leaves of geopolitics, policy, and markets has never been more important. These rising macro minds spend their days researching and understanding global risks and opportunities — whether to arm clients with insights for critical decisions or to pull the trigger on trades themselves. Citadel portfolio manager Adam Theriault-Shay's obsession with digging into obscure corners of global markets and conducting on-the-ground research to get satisfying answers sets him apart in a world fixated on data and artificial intelligence. It has also helped him earn a rates-and-currencies trading book of more than $1 billion before the age of 30, managing risk in line with that of macro hedge fund veterans. As a math student at MIT, Theriault-Shay was thorough and never took the easy way out, according to professor Bjorn Poonen. Theriault-Shay once encountered a confusing passage in the class textbook, written by one of the world's most renowned mathematicians. Poonen said that while most students might have skipped over it, he flagged it — and with good reason, it turned out: "There was an error in the book!" He applied to intern at quant hedge fund D.E. Shaw and stood out among an "extremely competitive applicant pool," one person who interviewed him said. After graduating in 2019, he started at Shaw full-time in its macro unit, researching and trading currencies and emerging-market rates, especially in Asia. "He has this inner, deep desire to figure out the truth and figure out what's really going on in markets," a former colleague said, adding that Theriault-Shay would get almost "giddy" about esoteric aspects of the market. Theriault-Shay had a penchant for disappearing down rabbit holes in individual countries and companies and resurfacing with insights sharp enough to nudge the group's thinking on some of its currency positions — an impressive feat for a junior, they said. Theriault-Shay was poached in 2021 by Citadel, joining as an associate PM in the group run by vaunted bond basis trader Jon Tipermas. Within two years, he was promoted to portfolio manager and now runs a small team. Theriault-Shay thrives on shoe-leather research, traveling to Asia multiple times a year to inform his trades. "He loves being on the ground and getting a sense of the local flavor and talking to people in Asia about markets," the former colleague said. Citadel declined to comment or make Theriault-Shay available for an interview. Just days into her new role as chief of staff to Larry Fink, Catherine Kress is already feeling the faster pace, she told Business Insider. The post puts her at the center of the world's largest asset manager — gatekeeper to BlackRock's cofounder and CEO, and offers what excites her most: "unparalleled exposure" to global business leaders and policymakers. Kress long knew she wanted a career at the "intersection of geopolitics, policy, economies, and markets." Until recently, she was BlackRock's head of geopolitics and research, unpacking issues from the AI race to trade protectionism and sharing them at conferences, boardrooms, and in meetings with major C-suite leaders. She helped turn the $12.5 trillion firm's first geopolitics team, led by former US national security advisor Tom Donilon, into a permanent fixture within the BlackRock Investment Institute. When she applied to be Donilon's advisor, she called it a "dream job" — even asking her husband to confirm the posting was real. Demand for her team's insights surged after the COVID pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as clients "realized national security and resilience concerns were increasingly taking priority or at least on par with pure cost efficiency and market objectives," she said. A psychology and anthropology major at the University of Notre Dame, she conducted fieldwork in Sierra Leone and pursued graduate research in Angola's energy sector at Oxford as a Clarendon scholar. She thought she might pursue a Ph.D. until a mentor urged her to apply her work in the private sector. Before joining BlackRock in 2018, she worked closely with Ian Bremmer, the political scientist and the founder of Eurasia Group, where she led training sessions on integrating geopolitical risk thinking with investing. She credits academia with teaching her to ground every view in facts, "never shooting from the hip," and for instilling in her the confidence to brief everyone from investors to world leaders. Now, as Fink's chief of staff and a mother to two young boys, she's entering what she calls the "culmination" of her career. A decade ago, while living in New Delhi and before he had ever set foot in the US, Nikunj Jain spent his free time Googling which colleges offered the best computer science programs. Now, after graduating from the University of California-Berkeley in two and a half years, he's the head of Asia research for Bridgewater, the world's largest hedge fund with $98 billion. Jain credits his rapid journey to the upper echelon of finance to a mix of persistence, strong familial support, and internal mentors, including the firm's co-chief investment officer, Karen Karniol-Tambour. From New York, Jain helps Bridgewater steer its coverage of all things Asia, where its flagship fund trades securities and its China-based funds have become a go-to investment for the country's elite. It's the type of day-to-day excitement and challenge that drew the 27-year-old to finance in the first place. After graduating, he studied machine learning, taught undergraduates math, interned for Apple, and worked for the Department of Defense, but found the Bay Area "a little slower than I would have liked." A friend suggested quantitative finance, leading him to apply to Bridgewater, the systematic investment manager founded 50 years ago by billionaire Ray Dalio, which has returned 26.4% in its flagship fund through September this year. He spent time focused on equities and fixed income, but in his current role, geography is the only boundary. His 15- to 20-person team, depending on the subject matter of the day, synthesizes activities across Asia into trading signals for Bridgewater's strategies. Jain sees macro investing as the culmination of answering "one of the toughest intellectual challenges." Asian markets, in particular, can be a puzzle thanks to relatively less reliable economic data. Jain's team stays on top of the latest shifts with a blend of quantitative know-how and "old-school macro investing practices," such as on-the-ground research and knowledge. Bridgewater has offices in Singapore and China, and Jain tries to visit the continent often. Seven years in, Jain says he has found a home in the industry: "I love the world of investing." From running multibillion-dollar books to navigating volatile markets, these young standouts are central to how their firms make money and manage risk. At hedge funds specifically, the battle for talent remains fierce. Some declined to make their stars available for interviews. When COVID shut down the world in 2020 and Manhattan offices emptied as workers isolated at home, distressed credit trader Jake Woodson was on a skeleton crew that never left Goldman Sachs' trading floor. It felt unusual at the time, but having the opportunity to navigate once-in-a-lifetime swings in airlines, retailers, and car-rental companies was "a blessing in disguise," says Woodson. "You can end up learning in a few weeks, or a couple months, more than in certain years," Woodson said. A couple of years later, he was promoted to his current role as head of US distressed credit trading. Shortly after, he navigated the 2023 banking crisis, generating tens of millions in profits for the firm — a seminal moment in his career. Woodson's unlikely path started at the University of British Columbia — hardly a recruiting target for US investment banks. There, he pulled off an impressive feat: he became the first varsity football player — and second athlete ever — admitted to the school's Portfolio Management Foundation, an intensive training program founded in the 1980s, in which a select group of students help manage a multimillion-dollar endowment. He started full-time at Goldman in 2014 in investment-grade credit, though he knew he eventually wanted to trade riskier securities. A year later, he jumped at an opportunity to work in junk bonds under Thomas Malafronte, who's now a PM at Millennium. Woodson earned a reputation as a reliable, insightful, and generous trading partner. He's "trustworthy and honest" and "people love working for and with him," one buy-side client said. "You'd rather be respected than liked, but he does things the right way and is in a special category where he's both," said Malafronte. Woodson presses his team of around 10, including traders and researchers, not just to identify mispricings, but to figure out what's behind the inefficiency — a forced seller or herd bias against a business model or company? (Goldman declined to comment on team head count.) "When things seem too obvious, they probably are," he added. Under his leadership, Goldman's US distressed team has ranked third in industry league tables for the past two years and is ranked No. 2 so far in 2025, according to Vali Analytics. Ilya Katz, the new portfolio manager for Citadel's Ashler Capital unit, has spent his short career investing for several billionaires. Katz, who has two degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, started at Steve Cohen's Point72 in 2016. He worked as an analyst for a team trading healthcare stocks — including companies that manufacture medical devices — that managed a book of more than $2 billion, according to his LinkedIn profile. He joined Cowen as the firm's head of healthcare data in 2019, prior to TD Bank's acquisition of the New York-based financial services company. He then rejoined the buy side, trading for London billionaires Ian Wace and Paul Marshall at their self-named megafund. There, Katz worked under healthcare portfolio manager Vijay Shankaran, who managed money for the firm's Eureka fund, a person familiar with the asset manager told Business Insider. He started as an analyst, blending quantitative tools with fundamental research to find opportunities in therapeutics and medical technology companies. He was given his own sleeve of capital to run under Shankaran, this person said, managing some of Marshall Wace's billions before being poached by Ken Griffin at the end of last year. Now at Ashler, Citadel's equities unit, his pod naturally focuses on the healthcare space, where he's been able to lean on his science background: He has a master's in biotechnology and an undergraduate degree from Penn's competitive Wharton program in economics. Even in the ultra-competitive world of multistrategy hedge funds, where every portfolio manager and analyst seemingly has an Ivy League degree and a sterling résumé, Katz stands out. One word an Ashler colleague used to describe the under-30 trader: savant. Christian Woo likens his work to building a Formula 1 car engine: The technology team provides the raw materials, the traders are the drivers, and his job is designing the machinery that makes everything run faster. At Bank of America, Woo is a managing director and who leads the credit systematic trading strategies team. They conduct quantitative research and develop a credit market-making algorithm, which handles smaller electronic inquiries and spreads risk from big client orders. Since joining in 2019, Woo has helped grow the bank's algorithm-based electronic trading volume in investment-grade credit fivefold. He said that it's been gratifying to see everyone's work "compound" as it continues to expand, especially since he was involved from the very beginning. Woo's team designs the algorithms that enable traders to quote bonds autonomously, manage risk after large portfolio trades, and process thousands of trades simultaneously — a leap from just a few years ago. That progress also reflects a broader market trend as Woo points out: Today, more than half of all corporate bond trading is done electronically, up from roughly 20% a decade ago. Honolulu isn't a traditional Wall Street launchpad, but his father, a wealth manager, exposed Woo to markets early, bringing him along to meet with clients across the Hawaiian islands. After starting on Citi's credit trading desk in 2015 in New York City, where he's based, he moved to Bank of America in 2019 and dove into electronic credit trading. He credits his drive to his mother, a nurse and healthcare worker who threw herself into every endeavor — including her passions such as pickleball and her stint in entrepreneurship. "She goes all in on things and commits very hard, and it's something I find that I do, as well," he said. He approaches his work the same way: tackling problems with curiosity and persistence. A mantra from Einstein has guided his career: "I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious." In the cutthroat world of hedge funds, especially at the multistrategy giants that have come to rule the industry, there's not much upside for portfolio managers to be a sounding board for others. Colleagues, much less people at rival funds, can be slow to share wisdom or hacks for fear of losing their own edge. Everyone is, more or less, competing against everyone else at all times. It's one of the reasons John Huh stands out. Huh, a portfolio manager at $14 billion Schonfeld Strategic Advisors, is a talented investor and a strong mentor for younger colleagues, according to those who know him. After graduating from New York University's Stern School of Business in 2012, he worked at Wells Fargo in equity research and then moved to the buy side in 2015. He joined Point72 in 2016, when it was trading its founder's cash and before it officially reopened to outside investors. He worked as an analyst covering stocks in the telecommunications, media, technology, and internet sectors through the firm's 2018 relaunch, and left the following year to join Schonfeld. Huh worked under Simon Silverston as an associate portfolio manager before being promoted at the end of last year to run his own team. Still specializing in technology, media, and telecommunications, Huh is a go-to source for many young stockpickers at the firm with questions or problems, according to one individual who works at the New York-based manager. Wall Street is constantly looking for an edge, which means firms are always racing to create new products and tools that give them — and their clients — an advantage. Whether it's reimagining how bonds are traded or bringing complex products like CLOs and tokenized funds to a broader investor base, these rising stars show how fresh ideas can quickly scale into breakthroughs that reshape markets. Sarah Naylor wanted to be in the room where decisions were made. After six years in investment-grade bond sales at big banks, she knew that room was usually reserved for senior staff. So when Citadel Securities tapped her in 2024 to help launch its corporate bond trading business, she jumped at what she called a "once-in-a-career" opportunity. Her readiness for that leap traces back to a turning point a few years in at Citigroup, which she joined in 2016 after graduating from Colgate. A senior salesman covering a major asset manager departed, and Naylor was asked to temporarily oversee the account. Lacking experience, she compensated with preparation — studying the client's portfolio and grilling traders for insights. Citi's standing improved, and she kept the account permanently. The episode shaped her philosophy to be an "internal expert" on her client. "I try to hold myself to the standard that anytime anyone internally has a question pertaining to my client, I should have the answer," Naylor said. One of her mentors at Citi, Sam Berberian, recruited her to Citadel Securities after he joined as head of credit trading in 2023. She joined the buildout in early 2024 and quickly found herself "in the room," weighing in on key decisions. One objective for the team has been tackling the "gray market," the window when newly announced bonds trade before official issuance. Citadel Securities views that period as critical for clients, but historically inefficient, since banks can't immediately resell the bonds they've issued, and pricing is often fragmented and handled over the phone. Naylor pitched Berberian an idea: a tool that would stream live data and pricing from Citadel Securities. Working across teams, Naylor helped propel that idea to reality this September with the launch of the "Gray Trading Panel" on Bloomberg terminals. The impact has been swift, she said. A large asset manager executed its first gray market trade, block trades increased, and market share ticked up. "I have learned more in the last 18 months than I had in my entire career combined," Naylor said. Jessica Shill didn't know she'd be working with niche CLO ETFs when she took a job with Janus Henderson in August of 2019. But shortly after she joined, that became a focus, bringing a traditionally opaque product for institutions to mainstream investors. Her team has grown to more than 20 people, and she's now a portfolio manager of three ETFs overseeing a combined $24.3 billion in assets. "Launching and management of the ETFs are definitely the keystone moments of my career," Shill said. She recently helped launch and develop the strategy of Janus' first tokenized fund — which has gathered nearly $800 million in assets since its June debut — and thinks blockchain will help asset management become more efficient. Shill credits her success to her diligence, such as rotating out of a bond as soon as she becomes uncomfortable holding it, and believes that the best choices are often the hardest ones. She's worked through "some pretty turbulent markets," like COVID, and thinks her ability to raise capital and willingness to "grind out sales" during that time helped prove her chops to management. "I am a firm believer in measure twice, cut once. Honestly, at work, it turns into measuring three or four times and cutting once," Shill said about her process for evaluating each bond. "As long as you're never trying to cut your corners, over time, you become confident." Shill, who didn't grow up in a family with Wall Street ties, said finance has been a good fit in part because it's "intellectually stimulating." The Maine native studied at Bryn Mawr College and spent two years at Wells Fargo before joining Janus in Denver. Since she works market hours but lives on Mountain Time, Shill begins her days early and typically has some time after work. In the summer, she'll often go for a bike ride before cooking dinner for herself and her husband and, no matter the season, reading for a bit before going to sleep.Interactive development by Randy Yeip.Corrections: October 6, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated Joe Slevin's age.

Ruth Umoh is the Next to Lead editor at Fortune, covering the next generation of C-Suite leaders. She also authors Fortune’s Next to Lead newsletter. Could staking your compensation on an all-or-nothing bet make you a better leader—or just a higher-stakes gambler? That question is resurfacing in boardrooms as “moonshot” pay packages gain traction among CEOs and boards seeking to inspire extraordinary performance and lock in ambitious talent, writes my colleague Amanda Gerut. The concept, first thrust into the spotlight by Elon Musk’s 2018 Tesla deal, has reemerged in striking fashion through Rick Smith, CEO of Axon Enterprise, the maker of Taser stun guns and police body cameras. In 2018, Smith accepted an unconventional offer: no bonuses, no meaningful salary (just $31,000 a year), and no equity unless he could grow Axon’s market cap tenfold over the next decade. Each $1 billion increase unlocked a tranche of stock, with the ultimate goal of lifting the company’s value from $2.5 billion to $13.5 billion. It was a daring bet, but one that paid off. Within five years, Smith had blown past each goal and became the highest-paid CEO in America in 2024 with $165 million in compensation. The stock surged more than 600%. Moonshot packages invert the standard logic of executive pay. Instead of the usual mix of salary, annual bonuses, and performance shares, they tie virtually all potential compensation to long-term milestones, often at seemingly impossible levels. Advocates argue that they strengthen alignment with shareholders, encourage long-term thinking, and inject urgency into the transformation process. Smith even extended a version of his plan to Axon employees, allowing them to trade portions of their pay for stock that vested alongside his. But the approach is not without controversy. The plans are highly volatile, difficult to calibrate, and often unpopular with investors wary of oversized payouts or asymmetric risk. Miss the mark, and the CEO gets nothing. Hit it too quickly, and shareholders may accuse boards of overpaying. Still, the model is spreading because, the rationale goes, extraordinary results demand extraordinary incentives, and in a market obsessed with innovation and valuation multiples, big bets may be the price of attracting and retaining elite executive talent. Whether these moonshots create enduring value or prove to be flashes of fortune remains an open question. What’s clear is that they represent a new frontier in corporate risk-taking—one that fuses pay, purpose, and performance into a single, high-stakes wager on leadership itself.

Title: Will RBI’s push for bank-funded acquisitions turn private credit's feast into famine?

Mumbai: A recent regulatory change proposing banks enter into acquisition financing could potentially disrupt the fast-growing private credit industry in pricing and deal-picking, and over the long term transform the way deals are structured, according to sector experts. The Reserve Bank of India, as part of its Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies released alongside the monetary policy statement on October 1 proposed allowing banks to fund corporate buyouts. At a broader level, the RBI’s proposal is “very proactive and progressive" and is expected to go a long way in reducing the cost and enhancing availability of capital pools for individuals and corporates, said Bhavdeep Bhatt, chief executive officer of Northern Arc Investments. Private credit growth has been strong in 2025. Total private credit deployment touched $9 billion across 79 deals in the first half of calendar 2025—a 53% jump from the first half of 2024 and close to three times the value for the latter half of 2024, a report by EY in August noted. The biggest of deals was the $3.1 billion raised by Porteast Investment of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group—the biggest onshore private credit transaction in India to date. Indian private credit players include Kotak Alternative Asset Management, 360 One, Avendus Capital, and Edelweiss Funds, among others; international players include Blackrock, Blackstone, KKR, Abudhabi Investment Authority, and several others. A key factor for the growth of the private credit market in India until now has been the RBI’s restrictions on banks providing acquisition finance, said Geeta Chugh, managing director, sector lead, financial services ratings at S&P Global Ratings. Longer term impactThe proposed entry of banks, with their relatively larger balance sheets and readiness to lend amid muted corporate growth, could potentially result in lower yields, looser terms, and weaker collateral structures. In some cases, enforcing collateral or ensuring debt coverage may be weaker than with traditional bank loans, other experts told Mint. Still, in the short to medium term, the overall impact on private credit funds is expected to be small, given the limited ability and skill sets of banks to fund complex deals and the flexibility at private credit firms on with customisations and value-addition. Private credit funds command superior returns because they offer customised funding structures—tailored for complexity, risk, scale and quick turnarounds. Bound by tight regulations, banks often lack flexibility and are likely to be limited to larger, simpler, and less risky transactions, said Ashwin Patni, head, wealth management services, Julius Baer. Most takers for private credit deals are mid-market corporates who require a nimble approach. Also Read | Buy now, pay later is surfing the private credit wave "Acquisition financing is just a small slice of the private credit pie, so any minor capital shift toward banks will not impact the broader opportunity set," said Patni. But, the crucial difference could be in how deals are structured with the entry of banks. Cost of fundingBanks with their lower cost of funds will have the advantage of lower pricing, something that private credit funds cannot compete with, experts said, adding that the latter will also then have to look at what value proposition they offer clients. Private credit currently prices at 14-17% IRR, and if banks are permitted to finance acquisitions, they could come in at a materially lower cost—around 10–12% all-in, given their access to low-cost deposits, said Atul Thakkar, executive director, Anand Rathi Investment Banking. Raghunath T, senior portfolio manager at Vivriti Asset Management, believes that this pricing dynamic is sustainable given that investor allocations to private credit have grown regardless of rate or liquidity considerations and driven by consistent outperformance compared to public debt markets. What’s more is that the deal flow for private credit funds is diversified across sectors, he said, adding that typically, sectors with M&As and extraordinarily high growth seek credit solutions from private credit funds. “Today, a lot of infrastructure platforms across renewable energy, transportation and high-growth segments like electronics manufacturing and logistics are contributing to a large share of the deal flow," Raghunath said. Red flagsDespite the proposed RBI norms expected to open up capital for acquisition financing, some market participants remain sceptical and warn that this comes with a higher risk of bank exposure to certain corporates. Also Read | Private credit is booming business. Where one pro sees risks and opportunities. While bank loans would likely carry tighter covenants and security packages compared to private credit, the only risk factor is the need for the central bank to set an overall limit on how much exposure each bank can take on in the private credit segment, said Thakkar of Anand Rathi Investment Banking. Others worry that if banks are allowed to finance acquisitions, it could lead to indirect promoter funding through backdoor loans, and without clear rules, acquisition finance might be misused. Regulators would likely require strict monitoring to ensure funds are not for equity buybacks or share pledges. “The systemic risk is limited right now because private credit is still a small slice compared to total bank lending," said Vishal Bansal, partner, debt and special situations, EY India. Risks such as asset quality deterioration could emerge if funds loosen standards to win deals or liquidity mismatches crop up if investors want to exit before loans mature, he cautioned. But Nilesh Dhedhi, MD & CEO, Avendus Finance Private Ltd ruled out systemic risks pointing to the fact that private credit assets under management (AUM) is not even 1% of total banking AUM. Besides, he said: “Private credit looks at risk… mostly in micro terms rather than macro terms [as banks do]. There are also very specific risk-driven analysis for a particular company or situations rather than a standardised approach [at banks]."

October 06, 2025 03:00 ET | Source: Advantest America, Inc. Advantest America, Inc. SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Advantest America, a leader in semiconductor test solutions, today announced it is reinventing semiconductor testing with the power of real-time artificial intelligence (AI). Advantest is combining advanced machine learning (ML) from NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) with the Advantest Cloud Solutions Real-Time Data Infrastructure (ACS RTDI™) to drive a shift from traditional test workflows to adaptive AI-driven systems. NVIDIA has selected ACS RTDI for high-volume production to power its latest AI-enabled applications for Blackwell and next-generation devices —aiming to deliver breakthrough efficiency, reduced costs, and improved yields. Transforming Test into Intelligence Testing has long been the cornerstone of chip manufacturing, ensuring every device meets exacting standards of quality and performance. Traditionally, this required weeks of data collection, fault analysis, and test deployment cycles. ACS RTDI moves testing from validation to prediction—transforming semiconductor production into an AI-driven, continuously adaptive process. Integrated with NVIDIA AI inference, ACS RTDI could bring real-time intelligence to semiconductor testing. For NVIDIA Blackwell and future devices, massive data streams are ingested through ACS Data-Feed-Forward cross-insertion, where GPU-accelerated compute optimizes the test set for every chip. This scalable GPU architecture expands seamlessly, supporting the concurrent training of multiple ML models—enabling non-stop operation to drive yield gains, dynamically optimized test coverage, and sharp reductions in latency, power, and cost. Scaling AI Across ProductionACS RTDI has demonstrated its robustness at high-volume production sites worldwide, securely supporting AI/ML-driven test automation across diverse applications. Its flexible architecture —separating data preparation, algorithms, and decisioning—empowers manufacturers to rapidly adapt as production needs evolve. “Integrating NVIDIA AI inference into high-volume production demonstrates the transformative potential of ACS solutions,” said Michael Chang, vice president and general manager of ACS at Advantest. “Together, we are accelerating the fusion of compute and data, paving the way for a new era of semiconductor testing that is adaptive, scalable, and intelligence-driven.” Building the AI-Driven Test Facility of the Future Advantest also plans to incorporate NVIDIA’s NeMo and NVIDIA NIM microservices into ACS semiconductor test analytics solutions. These technologies will curate heterogeneous production data, evaluate models, and deploy AI agents capable of running generative AI applications directly in the test environment.

French investment firm Ardian is buying one of Ireland's largest energy utilities Energia Group in a deal that values the firm at more than €2.5 billion, betting on a power supplier poised to serve the surging artificial intelligence industry. Ardian has agreed to buy Energia Group from infrastructure investment firm I Squared Capital. I Squared Capital had acquired the company in 2016 for €1 billion. The companies said today's deal will have no impact on Energia's customers, employees, partners or suppliers, adding that Energia remains committed to delivering on its strategy and supporting Ireland's sustainable energy future. The deal underscores surging investor interest in data centres that cater to the booming market for AI tools and power their growing adoption across the globe. BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners is nearing a deal to acquire Aligned Data Centers that could value the data centre operator at around $40 billion, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters last week. Energia represents Ardian's first deal in Ireland. Energia owns onshore wind farms with a capacity of 358 mega watts, supplies gas and electricity to over 898,000 clients and employs 1,117 people, according to its website. It supplies about 17% of the island of Ireland's total electricity requirements and 20% of its total wind power. "Energia's focus remains on transforming Ireland's energy system by deploying renewables and other low carbon solutions at scale, while continuing to deliver secure and affordable energy to our domestic and commercial customers. We are grateful for I Squared’s support over the past nine years and the strong, future-ready platform we have built together," its CEO Ian Thom said. "Ireland is at a pivotal point, with rapid electrification, growing demand from new technologies, and global investment in digital infrastructure all accelerating. Energia is ideally placed to meet these needs, and with Ardian's long-term backing, we’re excited to continue scaling our business to help power this next phase of Ireland’s growth for our customers, partners and employees," he added. "We are proud to be investing in Energia, which marks Ardian’s first investment in Ireland. The company has demonstrated its market leadership in Ireland and Northern Ireland over many years and has ambitious plans to grow, driven by secured capital projects and increasing energy demand," Juan Angoitia, Ardian's co-head of infrastructure Europe and senior managing director said. "Ardian is a highly experienced investor in essential infrastructure and European utilities. We have been impressed by Energia's strong growth and resilience in the context of a volatile energy market, and look forward to sharing our expertise to further develop its renewable generation portfolio, flexible capacity and enhance the efficiency of the whole company, " he added. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: US Govt Shutdown Clouds Economic Outlook: What Keeps Equities Buoyant? Ben Powell Explains

The ongoing US government shutdown has so far been overshadowed by the “AI megaforce,” which continues to provide huge tailwinds for equities, said Ben Powell, Chief Investment Strategist for the Middle East and Asia-Pacific at BlackRock. “It’s hard to say how long this will persist. Sometimes it lasts longer than a week,” Powell told NDTV Profit in an interaction, adding that economists are “flying blind” without the usual flow of data. “Last Friday should have been weekly initial jobless claims numbers, job reports data, nonfarm payrolls data— but we did not have any numbers. The implication is that it makes life difficult for all of us, and critically for the US Federal Reserve. The Fed no longer has access to cutting-edge data,” he said. Powell noted that the lack of updates was "not at all helpful for people trying to assess the economic outlook." The US government shut down after President Donald Trump and Congress failed to reach a funding agreement by Oct.1 deadline, leaving hundreds of thousands of federal employees facing furloughs and forcing many offices to close. During a shutdown, federal agencies cannot spend money beyond essential emergencies, meaning all “nonessential” functions are suspended until Congress restores funding. The disruption has already delayed the release of payroll data, deepening uncertainty around the economic outlook. Still, swap traders remain confident that the Federal Reserve will push ahead with another quarter-point interest rate cut in October, according to Bloomberg report. Meanwhile, the US government shutdown continued with unions representing hundreds of thousands of federal workers asking a judge to immediately block any mass firings by the Trump administration, the report further added. On the other hand, gold rose to another record — closing in on the $4,000 an ounce mark — as the US Federal government shutdown dragged on. "Rates traders are still pricing in a quarter-point cut for the end of the month, which will benefit gold further as it doesn’t pay interest," Bloomberg report added.

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AA.mkvtw6t3n Share article Print article There is a buzz of anticipation around Chris Kraus’ latest novel The Four Spent the Day Together, following the success of the television adaption of her postmodern feminist cult classic I Love Dick (1997). Review: The Four Spent the Day Together – Chris Kraus (Scribe) Kraus’ novels to this point have all been self-referential. The typical Kraus novel, as she recently explained, provides a fictionalised “case study of my life”. She writes what literary academic Mira Mattar calls “unconstrained, disobedient texts”, using “her own most immediately available raw material”. Though Kraus resists the term “autofiction”, she is interested in testing the limits of memoir, unsettling fact and fiction to deliver provocative commentaries on contemporary American culture. Her work combines high and low cultural elements with postmodern play, drawing on influences such as philosopher Jean Baudrillard and writer Kathy Acker, about whom she has written a landmark biography. This time, however, Kraus has added a true-crime twist, a move that changes the stakes of her novel’s biting social commentary. The Four Spent the Day Together is arguably Kraus’s most conceptually ambitious, formally interesting, and politically charged novel to date. Written in three historically overlapping sections, spanning the 1960s to the 2020s, it pursues new directions for her writing. The novel traces the tensions of everyday life in a declining global superpower. Its themes range from the rise of neoliberal greed, gentrification and the prison-industrial complex, to the toxic cloud of reactionary politics, censorship and cancel-culture that has settled over a twitterised America, including its literary culture. The Four Spent the Day Together initially presents itself as the story of an artist named Catt Greene – Kraus’ fictional alter ego, who is also the author of a book called I Love Dick. Readers will recall her from Kraus’ 2012 novel Summer of Hate (where she is named Catt Dunlop). The first section reads as a coming-of-age novel about Catt’s rebellious teenage years growing up in Milford, Connecticut. The second section is a work of thinly veiled autofiction about the pressures of Catt’s life as a middle-aged writer married to a recovering addict. In its final section, The Four Spent the Day Together becomes a “true-crime novel”. The move allows Catt to decentre herself, write about issues that fall well outside her usual field of vision as an artist. She sees parallels between her life and some teenagers involved in a meth-fuelled murder case. In exposing the similarities, Kraus deftly allegorises how poverty, racism and political corruption produce cycles of inequality for working-class Americans. Beginning in Milford during the turbulent 1960s, The Four Spent the Day Together adopts that era’s key slogan. It shows how “the personal is political”. Kraus reflects on the gentrification of Brooklyn, which prices Catt’s parents out of their working-class neighbourhood. The family moves to suburban Milford, where extreme economic inequality also predominates, despite the differences from the city. Catt’s father spends most of his days away at work in Cambridge University Press’s Manhattan office. Her mother remains at home caring for their two children, a housewife suffering from what second-wave feminist Betty Friedan called the “unspoken” problem haunting middle-class white women. Her sister Carla is struggling with a misdiagnosed developmental disability, which the precocious Catt openly resents, leading her to act out. Swept up in her generation’s spirit of rebelliousness, Catt becomes involved in the counterculture of sit-ins, drugs, motorcycles and radical politics. The novel then lurches forward in time to focus on Catt’s career as a writer and creative-writing professor, and on her relationships. Politics again rears its head in the characters’ everyday lives. Catt and her first husband, an older French philosophy professor (a principal character in I Love Dick), protest against George W. Bush and Dick Cheney’s infernal war in the Middle East and the reign of “antiterrorist” terror – one agenda of which was to crush political dissent by policing antiwar protesters. Political solidarity draws Catt to her second husband Paul Garcia (who also appears in Summer of Hate). Paul has served a trumped-up three-year prison sentence following a drug-fuelled crime spree, in which he stole $900 from a corporation Cheney had invested in. Catt and her first husband sponsor Paul to undertake a psychology degree, as he struggles to turn his life around. As Catt’s open marriage withers, she and Paul purchase a vacation house in rural Balsam, Minnesota: the land of Bob Dylan’s North Country Blues. Catt hopes to secure a creative retreat from the bustle of Los Angeles. Paul seeks a refuge from the difficulties of his social work in the city’s poorest, most desperate neighbourhoods. The longer they spend in the sublimely beautiful landscape of northern Minnesota, the more they become exposed to its dark enigmas. Once an iron-ore powerhouse, the post-industrial Iron Range is now a region in decline. Clinging to myths of a lost era of prosperity, it has become a MAGA stronghold of deeply encrusted conservatism, stark economic inequalities and rampant addiction. An epidemic of methamphetamines (or “hillbilly heroin” as it was dubbed in the 2000s) has spiralled out of control. The locale proves unhelpful to Paul’s recovery. A shift to his perspective in this section is crucial for the novel’s personalisation of politics. Paul is a working-class American from a racial minority and a mental health support worker. His life has been one of hardship. His perspective ties the book’s threads of political commentary together. A harrowing career counselling troubled youths and addicts, while struggling with his own recovery from addiction, leads him into a downward spiral: drink-driving offences, job layoffs and marital breakdown. The novel’s final section, set in the late 2010s, finds Catt grappling with the prospect of a second divorce. At this point, she learns of a murder trial in nearby Hibbing, Minnesota. Three teenagers are accused of conspiring to murder an acquaintance while under the influence of crystal meth. Their families, law enforcement, the community, Catt, and even the suspects themselves fail to understand their motives. Attempting to escape her personal and professional troubles, Catt becomes obsessed with the investigating the case. Rather than focus on the innocence or guilt of the accused, she studies their childhood experiences of poverty, broken homes, abuse and undiagnosed disability. In preparing this novel, Kraus conducted over 100 interviews with individuals who were in some way connected to the crime. It is worth noting that her publisher has heavily promoted this final section, going so far as to call The Four Spent the Day Together a “true crime” novel, even though this subplot does not materialise until the final third of the book. What is the upshot of this sudden detour into “true-crime fiction”? What are the implications of thinking about the book in this way? “Crimes are like books,” Kraus reflected in a recent interview, in that a “crime brackets life in the same way that a novel brackets time, and within the brackets you can start to study different flows”. This can lead to “a belated understanding of the whole systemic injustice that led to the situation in the first place”. Reading backwards from this point, we might trace how Kraus’s has plotted her personal history in a way that foreshadows the novel’s turning point. First, she probes her family’s troubles with depression and disability, and her own youthful experiments with recreational drugs and petty crime. Then she considers the difficulties of living with a spouse who is attempting to turn his life around but is caught at every turn, stigmatised as a felon and addict within a judicial system that racially profiles him. By refocusing the story around the lives of a group of kids before and after they commit an atrocious crime, Kraus challenges herself to “see things from the character’s point of view, not my point of view” in order to “psychically penetrate the mindscape of these kids and how they see things”. Incorporating investigative materials into a literary reconstruction of those characters and events, she explores the parallels between her history and theirs. What can a grisly meth-fuelled murder in northern Minnesota’s Iron Range tell us about post-industrial decline and the malaises of drug addiction, poverty and rising right-wing conservatism? Taking a leaf out of Truman Capote’s book (specifically, his “non-fiction novel” In Cold Blood), Kraus blends journalism with autofiction to explore how these characters’ lives are contoured by historical ruptures brought about by political struggles. Catt’s investigations into what pushed three teenagers to murder an acquaintance in cold blood lead to more urgent questions regarding what has gone so terribly wrong in American life. In a sense, Kraus is not writing a book about a crime, but about what a crime can teach us about what books do. For if books are like crimes, as she claims, then writing can be understood as means of “investigating things” by “looking a little deeper than people look in the course of an anesthetized daily life”. “The pleasure of reading is that the writer has looked that far and is telling you things that you either didn’t know or you knew in some subliminal way,” she explains. “The function of writing is to give thoughts and feelings a voice, and to bring them forward to articulate them.” On one level, the unexpected third section of the novel is Kraus using “true-crime fiction” to expose her culture’s inability to grapple with these sorts of issues. Kraus’ cult following includes major contemporary writers such as Sheila Heti, Rachel Kushner and Maggie Nelson, as well as celebrities Lena Dunham and Alexa Chung. But some readers will likely not agree with all Kraus has to say. She is razor-sharp about literary critics, within a wider satire of cultural criticism in the age of social media. Through Catt, Kraus also reflects on the strange consequences of becoming famous after the television adaptation of I Love Dick. At first, Catt is regarded as a trailblazing “older white feminist” and a forebear of the #MeToo movement. But she soon draws ire for refusing to boycott a Los Angeles artists’ collective accused of tacitly supporting the gentrification of working-class Chicano suburbs. Kraus here turns her satirical gaze back onto privileged but unaware Ivy League students and other commentators, who picketed her speaking events at NYU when she was promoting her Acker biography. In Summer of Hate, she wrote about her experiences investing in and restoring dilapidated apartment complexes in the 2000s. The project aimed at increasing decent and affordable housing for low-income families. In The Four Spent the Day Together, Catt (like Kraus) finds herself likened to coldblooded property investors like the Trump family – “slumlords” who profit from ruthless campaigns of racial redlining and gentrification (see Woody Guthrie’s classic song about the shady dealings and racism of his landlord Fred Trump for a concise account). Without knowing her, the protesters accuse Catt of “racially fetishising” her husband. Revisiting these scandals could, on one level, be dismissed as merely defensive. But Kraus also uses these uncomfortable experiences to develop an incisive social commentary on the toxic twitterisation of politics and culture. She draws attention to the contradictions and reactionary tendencies of social media and online communities, as well as the dangerous effects of censorship when these tendencies migrate into the sphere of literature and criticism. Kraus has said that, in writing this novel, she hoped it might provide “a window into what the culture and consciousness is outside of the intellectual worlds in mainstream America”. This is, she observed, “not something that’s looked at much in high art” in the United States. The Four Spent the Day Together, however, achieves precisely that. It culminates in a vision of cultural vacuity, rampant political corruption, overpolicing and mass incarceration – and public health and welfare systems that fail to provide adequate safety nets for individuals or support for communities in crisis. Instead of an autobiography with a true-crime novel tacked on, we are left with a sobering allegory of America’s contradictions and its longstanding political inequalities. Kraus describes how these have deepened and morphed into new, frightening shapes over the past 60 years. Provocative yet unflinching, The Four Spent the Day Together promises to ignite difficult conversations about what has led to the culture and politics of Trump’s America 2.0.

Title: India Well-Positioned For Equity Upside; Bitcoin, Gold Strong Hedge, Says BlackRock's Ben Powell

At a time when global investors have been cautious, India's equity market stands out as one of the most promising opportunities for investors in the coming quarters, according to Ben Powell, Chief Investment Strategist for the Middle East and Asia-Pacific at BlackRock. “India has an important part to play in portfolios going forward,” Powell said, adding that the country’s macroeconomic fundamentals remain strong despite headwinds from global trade dynamics. “It has had a few quarters buffeted by U.S. trade dynamics. Looking forward, I am optimistic about Indian equities. There seems to be a general lack of enthusiasm from global investors, and I think that presents opportunities for us as investors to pick our spots,” he said. Powell added that India's macro environment looks good while the economy is supported by low inflation and the room for the Reserve Bank of India to issue further rate cuts. "The Indian economy continues to be resilient from a macro context. Inflation is pretty low, thus giving the RBI room for rate cuts. That’s a good starting point for Indian equities to do better in the coming quarters,” he said. Powell's comments on India comes against the backdrop of the US government shutdown and an uncertain macro environment. But despite the immediate headwind linked to the US government shutdown, Powell believes the AI-driven "megaforce" will be supporting the markets. “This kind of confusion has been overwhelmed by the ongoing AI megaforce, which continues to be a huge tailwind for markets,” he said, adding that investors should also think about hard assets such as copper, given the energy demands that will come with large-scale AI and electrification trends. Powell went on to talk about portfolio diversification, adding that gold and Bitcoin, which recently touched the $125,000 mark for the first time, could be excellent hedges against ongoing volatility. “Commodities can play a part in a well-diversified portfolio,” he said. “Having a 2% exposure to Bitcoin, for example, could make sense. The same goes for Gold."

October 05, 2025 20:00 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Oct. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF. “Welcome to the 23rd issue of our Weekly Report. Let’s start with a major piece of positive news over the weekend: the Trump administration is reportedly considering a significant tariff reduction for the major automobile producers in the United States, if they produce or assemble their cars in the United States. If implemented, this policy would bring tangible benefits to the U.S. advanced manufacturing and automotive industries. It would not only ease cost pressures for domestic manufacturers but also send a clear signal of America’s strong commitment to supporting local innovation and manufacturing. For FF and FX, it could be of great significance: First, it would bring more flexibility to the pricing and profitability model of FX Super One and other products in the North American market; second, it would be tantamount to a vote of confidence in the U.S. automotive industry and could further enhance the confidence of the capital market and partners in the long-term development of FF and FX. Our Government Relations team has been actively engaging in constructive dialogue since the Trump administration imposed higher tariffs in April this year. We believe tariff reduction should be the right direction for both industrial development and policy guidance. Here's how the week progressed: On EAI Flywheel, S2-4 Product & Technology, Supply Chain, Production & Delivery: After multiple rounds of discussions, reviews, and alignment, we have finalized the U.S. production assembly plan for FX Super One. Our bridge partners and supply chain collaborators will now commence component supply for the production assembly phase, as the entire team pushes toward the milestone of rolling out the first U.S.-version FX Super One by year-end. This marks not only a critical milestone toward achieving our target but also one of the most essential components in the entire mass-production system. The production assembly plan will have a major impact on vehicle delivery cost and efficiency and will play a decisive role in driving cost optimization and operational efficiency across the product’s full lifecycle. Based on the finalized plan, we are confident in the potential of the FX Super One. At the same time, as one of the most complex phases in executing the Bridge Strategy, the component supply system has also reached its initial completion. We extend our sincere appreciation to the entire FX team for their dedicated efforts and to our bridge partners for their strong support. Beyond finalizing the production assembly plan, Super One has also been undergoing ongoing testing, development, and validation in both the U.S. and UAE. With the UAE final launch set for October 28 and deliveries commencing as early as November, our global teams are working intensively to support the regional operation in completing all pre-launch preparations. This week, validation of key third-party applications for the UAE version of Super One was successfully completed. On S6 Middle East: This week, FF was invited to participate in WETEX 2025 in the Middle East. Both the FF 91 and FX Super One were showcased, receiving high praise and strong purchase interest from members of the UAE and Dubai royal families as well as senior government officials. This was not only a product showcase, but also a demonstration of our systematic solutions for future mobility, energy, and sustainability. It marks a solid step forward in our strategic third pole in the Middle East. Going to S7, Capability and System Build-Up:Three new leaders recently joined FF - Deputy GC, Head of IR, and Head of Finance. Their arrival will further strengthen our expertise in legal affairs, capital markets communication, and financial management. Now let’s look at the Crypto flywheel: This week, we successfully closed a strategic investment in Nasdaq-listed QLGN. Based on the closing price on the day of transaction closing, FF’s $30M investment in QLGN reflected a nearly 140% unrealized gain. If approved at the stockholders’ meeting, QLGN will be rebranded as CXC10 and is expected to officially launch its new Crypto and Web3 business. The CXC10 company is expected to focus on six core products under the “Three Growth Engines.” The C10 Treasury from the first Growth Engine—C10, is expected to begin asset allocation on the Top 10 crypto coins next week.As Chief Advisor, I will provide comprehensive consultation to the board of CXC10, and support and empower the team and the company, particularly in the areas of product, AI, user ecosystem development, strategy, HR, and corporate AI management system. Globally, this week’s surge in Crypto markets and the excitement of Token2049 once again validated the forward-looking nature of our Dual Flywheel & Dual Bridge Eco-Strategy. The meta-chemistry of Web2 and Web3 is not only about the convergence of software and hardware, virtual and physical, but also about the convergence of financial ecosystems and mobility ecosystems, artificial intelligence and Crypto. I believe this could unlock greater value creation for FFAI. Finally, our issues, reflections, and solutions over the week.Last week, one of our satellite office buildings at HQ experienced a fire incident. Fortunately, no one was injured. Nevertheless, this incident serves as a reminder for FF’s facility fire prevention efforts. We will make necessary improvements and adjustments to further strengthen our safety system and eliminate potential risks. Looking ahead to the next week: We will continue to focus on FX Super One’s U.S. production readiness and UAE delivery preparation. Also, we expect to host the “Drive Home Together” co-creation event for Super One and FF 91. Thank you all, and we'll see you next week.” ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company.

More Info A couple of years ago, a cross-section of Wall Street was highly bullish on the community solar sector, with some predicting that it was poised to become the most prevalent model of residential solar power distribution in the United States. First unveiled about two decades ago, community solar entails a small-scale solar model wherein customers purchase shares in a new solar farm in their service area, developers build the project then subscribers receive credits that cut their utility bills by ~10%. Community solar offers a viable solution to the roughly half of American households that are unable to install rooftop solar due to factors like roof shading, issues with property ownership or specific regulations. Further, these solar projects tend to offer friendlier contract terms for people with lower credit scores. Unfortunately, the community solar boom could be over before it has even properly begun. A fresh report by global data, research, and consulting services provider, WoodMackenzie, has revealed that U.S. community solar installations dropped 36% year over year in the first half of the current year, with just 437 MW installed, thanks to Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. OBBBA gutted key tax incentives for clean energy projects, with the bill’s impact expected to get worse as the years roll on. WoodMac is now decidedly bearish on the sector, and expects community solar installations to contract 12% annually through 2030. Total U.S. community solar installations clocked in at 9.1 GW at the end of June 2025, and are projected to exceed 16 GW by 2030. Wood Mackenzie does not see much upside in the sector, and has predicted that installations could exceed the forecast figure by 1.3 GW on favorable state policy while further tax credit complications could lower the outlook by 1.2 GW. “The final bill offers a crucial four-year window for projects already under development to come online and secure the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), supporting near-term buildout,” Caitlin Connelly, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, told PV Magazine. “As of mid-2025, there are over 9 GW of community solar projects under development, with over 1.4 GW known to be under construction,” she added. Related: OPEC+: Reuters Leaks on Oil Plans Again Wood Mackenzie has attributed this year’s big decline to falling volumes in New York and in Maine, after the former program was recently overhauled. New York alone is expected to contribute nearly 30% of the U.S. decline in community solar installations in 2025. The analysts have noted that Massachusetts, Maryland and New Jersey are also facing similar problems as they transition between program iterations, adding that multiple states have generally struggled to pass new legislation. Solar Stocks Shine Nevertheless, solar stocks have been defying the bearish sentiment pervading the clean energy sector. Back in July, U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’, rolling back many clean energy credits enacted by former President Joe Biden under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. As widely expected, OBBBA is far from beautiful for various industries within the solar and wind energy sectors. However, the solar sector has continued to outperform, thanks in large part to robust U.S. and global solar demand as well as specific provisions within the OBBBA that favor solar manufacturing in the United States. The solar sector’s favorite benchmark, Invesco Solar ETF (NYSEARCA:TAN), has comfortably outpaced its oil and gas peers, returning 40.5% in the year-to-date compared to 4.2% return by the oil and gas benchmark, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLE), and 14.8% gain by the S&P 500. OBBBA favors solar manufacturing through provisions that incentivize domestic production and streamline the tax credit process, while also setting deadlines for construction and placement in service of solar projects. Specifically, it maintains and clarifies the tax credits for solar projects under Sections 48E and 45Y, while also phasing them out for wind and solar projects placed in service after December 31, 2027, unless construction began within 12 months of the Act's enactment. First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is one of the companies heavily favored by OBBBA, with the stock up 33.6% YTD. UBS recently reiterated its Buy rating and hiked its price target on FSLR to $275 from $255, saying the company will receive a significant boost to the bottomline from OBBBA credits. According to UBS, the present value of 45X tax credits for the company is worth $75 per share, while the company is expected to grow net cash to $25 per share by the second quarter of 2026. UBS says its PT is conservative, pointing out that it did not factor in extra earnings when First Solar’s finishing factory comes online. First Solar's 3.5 GW per year manufacturing facility in Louisiana is expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2025. This facility is part of First Solar's broader strategy to scale its American manufacturing footprint to over 10 gigawatts (GW) by 2025, according to Made in Alabama. The Louisiana factory, along with a new facility in Alabama, is are key component of this expansion. Israel-based SolarEdge (NASDAQ: SEDG) leads the sector with YTD returns of 172.4%. Regarding regulatory changes under OBBBA, SolarEdge CEO Shuki Nir says the company’s multi-year strategy of onshoring manufacturing to the U.S. will help it preserve 45X advanced manufacturing credits over the next 7 years. Meanwhile, some residential solar companies are also defying bearish projections. California-based residential solar company Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) has surged 107.8% YTD thanks to the company’s robust cost efficiencies as well as a record 70% storage attachment rate in its latest quarter. Sunrun installed a record 392 MWh of storage capacity during the second quarter, good for a 48% Y/Y increase, while solar capacity installations clocked in at 227 MW, up 18% Y/Y. Meanwhile, subscriber additions grew 15%, bringing the company’s total subscribers to 941,701 as of June 30. A new conflict in the Middle East... a surprise OPEC+ decision... a massive shift in Chinese demand. Most investors only react to the headlines.

Title: These Are The Startups Merging Your Brain With AI

ByRob Toews, Contributor. We stand at the cusp of a massive technology paradigm shift that promises to transform human civilization. Sam Altman and Elon Musk are building rival companies to compete over what will be one of the biggest market opportunities in history. No, we are not talking about generative AI. We are not talking about OpenAI and xAI. We are talking about brain-computer interfaces. Musk’s Neuralink and Altman’s newly launched Merge Labs are among a handful of companies at the forefront of this fast-moving field. To most people, brain-computer interfaces (BCI) sound like science fiction. But this technology is getting real, quickly. BCI is nearing an inflection point in terms of real-world functionality, though most people haven’t yet realized it. Before long, these products will be ready for mainstream use and will begin to spread through society. Far-fetched though it may sound, capabilities like telepathy will soon be possible. One reason why BCI matters so much is that it will play a central role in defining how human intelligence and artificial intelligence fit together in a world with powerful AI. Now is the time to start paying serious attention to this field. Brain-computer interfaces are technologies that enable humans to interact directly with digital devices and the outside world using their minds. BCI is not one product or one technology. It is an entire discipline, encompassing various technical approaches, sensor types, capabilities and use cases. It includes both technologies that can interpret what is happening in the brain (i.e., ”read from” the brain) and technologies that can change what is happening in the brain (i.e., “write to” the brain). Products that enable you to control your computer using only your thoughts; products that send personalized electrical pulses to your brain to make you focus better or sleep better; products that can instantly translate your thoughts into written text; products that can enable blind people to see; products that can treat conditions like depression or OCD or PTSD by directly modifying your brain’s activity—these are all examples of BCI products under development today. BCI is not a new field. The first successful demonstration of a brain-computer interface in a human came in 1973, when participants in a UCLA study directly controlled a cursor on a computer screen with their minds based on EEG signals. Today, when most people think of brain-computer interfaces, they think of Neuralink, the BCI company launched by Elon Musk in 2016. Though it was not the first and is not the only BCI startup, Neuralink has played a central role in advancing this field in recent years. A fundamental divide lies at the heart of the field of BCI: invasive methods versus non-invasive methods. In order to understand this technology and its future, it is essential to understand this divide. Invasive approaches to BCI entail putting electronics inside the skull, directly in or on the brain. They require surgery. Most frequently the surgery is a craniotonomy, which involves cutting open the skull to implant a BCI in the brain. Neuralink is the most well-known example of an invasive BCI company. (The term “implantable” is sometimes used as a more neutral alternative to “invasive.”) Non-invasive approaches, on the other hand, do not require a medical procedure. They rely on sensors that sit outside the skull (say, on a headband or a hat) to collect and interpret signals from the brain. The divide between invasive and non-invasive methods boils down to a tradeoff between accessibility (how easy the technology is for people to use) and signal quality (how detailed and accurate the information exchanged between brain and computer can be). Cutting open the skull to implant a BCI in the brain is a high-risk, high-cost undertaking. It represents a major barrier to the technology’s widespread adoption. But conventional wisdom has long held that invasive methods are the only path to building the most sophisticated brain-computer interfaces, because non-invasive approaches simply cannot provide sufficiently high-fidelity information about brain activity. In recent years, innovations in hardware and in AI have begun to challenge this conventional wisdom. Higher-performing sensors are unlocking richer brain data non-invasively. More importantly, powerful new AI technologies are making it possible to extract greater signal from this data. If non-invasive methods can approach parity in performance with invasive methods, there is little doubt that they will win out, given how much easier they are to adopt. But that remains a huge “if.” No one can say with certainty where the performance ceiling will be for non-invasive methods. Many billions of dollars have been invested into both invasive and non-invasive BCI approaches in recent years. Much is at stake as this technology race unfolds over the coming years. Whether invasive or non-invasive, how exactly do brain-computer interfaces work? How is it possible for a digital computer to directly read from and write to a human brain? A quick exploration of how the brain works will sharpen our understanding of BCI technology. Like the rest of your body, your brain is made up of cells—in particular, a special kind of cell called a neuron. The human brain consists of roughly 86 billion neurons. These neurons connect to one another in complex and intertwining ways, with any given neuron connecting to as many as tens of thousands of other neurons. (Hence the term “neural network.”) In total, there are over 100 trillion connections between neurons in the human brain. Information flows through the neurons in your brain via electricity—the same force that powers kitchen appliances and lightbulbs and iPhones. This basic fact is the foundation of BCI technology. Whenever your brain does something—for instance, when you think a thought, or speak a sentence, or move your arm, or recognize a face—your neurons are sending electrical signals to one another, at massive scale, in particular patterns. At the most basic level, the information that a neuron communicates is binary: either it fires (i.e., propagates an electrical charge to its neighboring neuron) or it does not. This represents an important parallel between human brains and digital computers, which also encode information in binary form (i.e., 0 or 1). The electrical signal that comes from a single neuron firing is tiny: about a billionth of an amp and a tenth of a volt. But it is a concrete, detectable physical event in the world. And it triggers other detectable physical events in the world. For instance, because electricity and magnetism are two sides of the same underlying phenomenon—electromagnetism—when a neuron fires and generates a tiny electrical signal, it also generates a tiny magnetic field. Blood flow also increases to neurons when they fire, another physiological change whose patterns can be measured and analyzed. It is these physical events that BCI sensors detect and interpret in order to decode what is happening inside the brain. A range of different BCI sensor technologies have been developed that tackle this challenge in different ways. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. Invasive BCI systems generally use sensors called electrodes—simple devices that sense electrical activity—to detect when neurons fire. Invasive systems are in direct contact with neurons, after all, so they have little need to rely on indirect indicators of neural activity. Non-invasive BCI, too, often uses sensors based on electricity, most commonly the electroencephalogram (EEG), the world’s oldest and most widely used brain sensor. But a number of other non-invasive sensor modalities have been developed more recently. These include magnetoencephalography (MEG), which detects changes in the brain’s magnetic fields, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which uses light beams to detect changes in blood flow in the brain. The best way to understand the state of the art in BCI technology today is to explore what today’s leading BCI startups are doing. Let’s start on the invasive side. In order to understand today’s invasive BCI startup landscape, the best place to start is with a brief history lesson. The first BCI technology to be implanted into a human’s brain was the “Utah array,” developed at the University of Utah in the 1980s and implanted into humans in clinical trials starting in the 1990s. The Utah array consists of a bed of 100 rigid needles measuring about one millimeter in length, each of which has an electrode at its tip. It looks like this: Implanting the Utah array entails cutting open the patient’s skull via a surgery called a crainiotomy and pushing the device into the patient’s brain. The Utah array was an important breakthrough in the development of brain-computer interfaces. It was the first technology to enable a human to control external devices like a computer or a robotic arm purely by thought. For a long time, it represented the gold standard in invasive BCI research. However, the Utah array also faces serious limitations that have precluded it from having widespread real-world clinical utility. Because it entails sticking a foreign object into brain tissue, it can activate a strong immune response, lead to scarring and inflammation, and disrupt the brain’s microbiome. The best way to understand the Utah array’s shortcomings is through an important concept in BCI technology known (vividly) as the “butcher ratio”: the ratio of the number of neurons that a BCI technology kills relative to the number of neurons that it can record from. The Utah array has a terrible butcher ratio. For every one neuron that it can stably record from, it kills hundreds or thousands of neurons (because its needles pierce through them). The first invasive BCI startups were based on the Utah array. This included Blackrock Neurotech (founded in 2008 as a spinout of the original University of Utah research) and Paradromics (founded in 2015). Despite years of effort and hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, these companies have not had success in advancing their technologies into clinical trials, due largely to the shortcomings of the Utah array form factor. Last year, Tether (yes, the crypto company) acquired majority control of Blackrock Neurotech for $200 million. Another early competitor is worth mentioning—Synchron, founded in 2012 in Australia. Synchron has taken a different and quite clever approach to getting electronics into the human brain. Rather than cutting open the skull, Synchron has developed a BCI device that is inserted into a patient’s blood vessel. The device is then guided via the blood vessels to the brain, where it comes to rest in one of the major veins directly adjacent to the brain. This surgical procedure is simpler than a crainiotomy. It is very similar to the procedure used to implant coronary stents, which for decades has been one of the most common procedures in all of medicine. And it avoids sticking a foreign object into brain tissue, meaning its butcher ratio is zero. As a result, Synchron has made meaningful progress on the regulatory front. It was one of the first invasive BCI companies to receive FDA clearance to begin clinical trials. Its devices have been successfully implanted for years now in several patients with no serious adverse health effects. Synchron has raised over $100 million from leading venture capital firms including Khosla Ventures and ARCH Venture Partners. Earlier this year, the company announced high-profile partnerships with Nvidia and with Apple. But the same thing that makes Synchron’s approach safer and simpler may make it fundamentally limited. Because Synchron’s device does not directly interface with the brain’s neurons but rather sits inside a blood vessel next to the brain, the signals that it collects from the brain are less granular than other invasive methods. Synchron’s device is also meaningfully lower bandwidth than its competitors: it has only 16 electrodes (compared to, for example, Neuralink’s 1,024). And Synchron’s device can only “read from,” not “write to,” the brain. To date, the primary capability that patients with Synchron’s device have demonstrated is the ability to complete a simple click on a computer with their thoughts. While this can be a useful capability for a paralyzed patient, it is a far cry from more sophisticated BCI tasks like decoding thought into language. Synchron has plans to expand its BCI platform beyond a single 16-electrode device in a blood vessel. It remains to be seen whether the company can execute on this roadmap. This brings us to the most famous BCI company of all: Neuralink, founded in 2016 by Elon Musk, the world’s most successful (and polarizing) entrepreneur. Neuralink has aimed to fundamentally improve upon earlier BCI efforts. The company’s most important innovation compared to the BCI companies that came before has been to develop flexible threads, rather than rigid needles, to penetrate into the brain. These flexible threads are a marvel of modern engineering: each one is thinner than a human hair and contains 16 electrodes. They are less harmful than the Utah array’s needles, killing fewer neurons and causing less scarring. Other important innovations that Neuralink has pioneered include developing a neurosurgical robot to automate parts of the implantation surgery; making its BCI device fully wireless and battery-powered; and increasing the total number of electrodes on its BCI (1,024 channels for Neuralink’s current array versus 96 channels for the original Utah array and 16 channels for Synchron’s device), which enables richer information exchange between computer and brain. Like Synchron, Neuralink has progressed to clinical trials, successfully implanting its devices in 12 human patients to date. Videos of Noland Arbaugh, the first patient to receive Neuralink’s BCI, playing computer chess with his mind went viral last year, educating and inspiring the world about the potential of BCI. As with most Elon Musk companies, Neuralink has had no problem fundraising: the company has raised over $1 billion to date, most recently at a $9.7 billion valuation earlier this year. Yet ultimately, Neuralink’s approach remains within the decades-old Utah array paradigm: it involves sticking foreign objects into the patient’s brain tissue, killing some neurons in order to record from other neurons. To be clear, in many cases, it can be a worthwhile tradeoff to kill some neurons in order to unlock valuable functionality for the patient: say, enabling a paralyzed person to communicate with the outside world. The human brain entails plenty of redundancy, so it is possible to kill some neurons and still leave the patient’s brain functional. But this approach does not scale well. As more arrays are inserted into a patient’s brain in order to increase brain coverage, the number of neurons killed inevitably scales in tandem. If the goal is to scale BCI to whole-brain coverage in order to enable diverse and wide-ranging capabilities, this is a serious shortcoming of penetrating electrodes. Each Neuralink array is small, covering less than 0.1% of the brain’s total surface area. Many Neuralink arrays would therefore need to be implanted in order to cover a meaningful portion of the brain. But the butcher ratio presents a real problem for scaling the number of Neuralink arrays. For now, only single Neuralink arrays have been implanted in humans. Soon after Noland Arbaugh’s implantation surgery, 85% of the flexible threads implanted into his brain retracted out of his brain. Neuralink was able to stabilize and recover performance for Arbaugh’s BCI by reading local field potentials from his brain’s surface. Aside from fueling skepticism about the durability of Neuralink’s flexible threads, this incident raised a more fundamental question: are penetrating electrodes actually necessary in the first place? In recent years, a new generation of invasive BCI companies has emerged to explore newer technology approaches. While these companies are pursuing different research and product directions, they are united by one core insight: penetrating electrodes are inherently flawed because of the butcher ratio and will never be able to scale to whole-brain devices. Two startups in particular are worth highlighting: Precision Neuroscience and Science Corporation, both founded in 2021 by departed Neuralink cofounders. Precision Neuroscience is led by neurosurgeon Ben Rapoport. A few years after cofounding Neuralink with Elon Musk, Rapoport decided to leave the company because he concluded that penetrating electrodes were the wrong path forward for BCI. “For a medical device, safety often implies minimal invasiveness,” Rapaport said in an interview last year. “In the early days of brain-computer interfaces, there was this notion that in order to extract information-rich data from the brain, one needed to penetrate the brain with tiny little needle-like electrodes. But this method has one big drawback: it causes some amount of brain damage when they’re inserted to the brain. We realized it was possible to extract information-rich data from the brain without damaging the brain.” How does Precision’s approach work? Precision uses a BCI technology known as electrocorticography, or ECoG. Like other invasive BCI methods, it requires surgery to implant. It goes underneath the skull and makes direct contact with the brain. But rather than penetrating into the brain’s tissue, it sits directly on top of the brain. This means it does not kill neurons (butcher ratio of zero), cause scarring or trigger an immune response from the insertion of a foreign object into the brain. Precision’s current array contains 1,024 electrodes, the same number as Neuralink’s. Because of its safer, lower-risk approach, Precision has progressed rapidly in clinical trials. Its device has already been temporarily implanted in a few dozen patients. The company received FDA Breakthrough Device designation in 2023 and FDA 510(k) clearance earlier this year. The safety advantages of a BCI device that stays on the brain’s surface rather than penetrating into its tissue are easy to understand. But does it work as well as penetrating electrodes do? If ECoG avoided brain damage but could not deliver advanced BCI capabilities on par with penetrating electrodes, then it would not be a particularly compelling solution. Years of clinical research, in particular from Dr. Edward Chang’s lab at UCSF, indicate that ECoG-based BCI can in fact enable the most sophisticated BCI use cases without needing to penetrate into brain tissue. In 2021, Dr. Chang’s UCSF lab was the first in the world to show that an invasive BCI system could accurately turn a person’s thoughts into written words. In a followup study in 2023, the same UCSF research team went further, showing that its system could decode a paralyzed patient’s thoughts into words, speech and facial expressions at the same time, with an average speed of 78 words per minute. Earlier this year, moving beyond language, UCSF researchers showed that an ECoG system could enable a paralyzed patient to control a robotic arm and hand with their thoughts. All of these research breakthroughs were achieved using non-penetrating ECoG devices. These capabilities do not just match but in fact surpass anything that Neuralink or any other company has yet demonstrated publicly with penetrating electrodes. Neuralink’s focus to this point has been to enable patients to control a computer cursor with their thoughts. While computer control is an important and useful ability, it is significantly lower-dimensional and less complex of a feat than accurately decoding language. Precision expects to receive FDA approval and begin commercializing its BCI product by 2028 or 2029. The final invasive BCI startup that we will discuss, Science Corporation, is the most ambitious and mind-bending of them all. Science was founded in 2021 by Max Hodak, the polymathic cofounder and former president of Neuralink. The company has raised close to $300 million to date from investors including Khosla Ventures. Science is pursuing two main product lines. The first is an implant that goes into the retina and can restore sight to certain types of blind patients. Last year, Science completed a successful clinical trial for this technology in which blind patients regained the ability to, for instance, read books and complete crossword puzzles. The company is aiming to receive final regulatory approval and begin commercializing this product as soon as next year in Europe, with the U.S. following thereafter. Restoring sight to the blind is ambitious enough—it is literally biblical. But Science’s second product seeks to push the frontiers of brain science far further. The company is developing a biohybrid neural interface. All the other brain-computer interface technologies that we have discussed in this article are made of traditional materials like metal and plastic. Science’s biohybrid BCI, on the other hand, combines engineered hardware with living cells. How does it work? The company grows living biological neurons (originally derived from stem cells) in a lab. They embed those biological neurons into an electronic device and then implant the combined biological/electronic system on a patient’s brain. Once implanted, the engineered neurons gradually grow into and form connections with the patient’s own neurons, essentially becoming an extension of the patient’s brain. This approach eliminates the need to harmfully jab metal or plastic into a patient’s brain in order to bring electrodes and neurons next to one another. Instead, the patient’s own neurons grow toward and form natural connections with the bioengineered neurons, which themselves are already connected to electrodes. Biohybrid BCIs ingeniously leverage biology, harnessing biological neurons’ natural ability to safely integrate with brain tissue and to efficiently transmit information. No entity in the known universe, after all, is better suited to interface with the brain’s neurons than…other biological neurons. Consider how much higher-bandwidth a biohybrid BCI could be than a conventional BCI. Since neurons form many connections with one another, if a biohybrid BCI contained one million engineered neurons (which would fit in less than one cubic millimeter—quite feasible from a space perspective), that could produce one billion connections between the patient’s brain and the BCI. Compare that to the 1,024 electrodes of today’s Neuralink or Precision devices. It is important to note that this technology is still in the early stages of development. It is not yet clear that it will work in humans. Many thorny scientific and engineering challenges remain to be solved. Many years of research and development lie ahead. But, if they work, biohybrid BCIs could prove to be the safest, highest-performing and most elegant invasive BCI technology of all—the ultimate way to meld the human brain and digital technology. Stay tuned for the second part of this two-part article series, coming out in a few weeks, which will dive into non-invasive BCI technology and startups. Before we conclude, let’s zoom out and ask a basic question: how big of a deal is brain-computer interface technology? BCI is fascinating and futuristic technology, no doubt. But, relative to other cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence or nuclear energy, how much will it ultimately matter to the world? How big of an impact will it have on humanity? The short answer: BCI will have an enormous and transformative impact on humanity. The nearest-term applications of BCI will be medical, so let’s start there. Tens of millions of people around the world today are paralyzed due to stroke, spinal cord injuries, ALS and other causes. Brain-computer interfaces could give these people their lives back, enabling them to communicate with others, move physical objects, and engage with the outside world in ways that previously would have been impossible. Beyond giving the gifts of speech and movement to the paralyzed, novel forms of BCI that can precisely modulate patients’ brain activity may offer powerful solutions for a wide range of neuropsychiatric conditions: depression, alcoholism, OCD, chronic pain, insomnia, PTSD, epilepsy, Parkinson’s and more. This is not just a hypothetical possibility: recent peer-reviewed research has clearly demonstrated the potential of these next-generation, AI-based neuromodulatory approaches. The price per patient for an invasive BCI implant is expected to be on the order of $150,000 (with insurance providers expected to play a key role in covering it). This means that, in addition to its tremendous positive human impact, medical BCI represents an enormous market opportunity—up to hundreds of billions of dollars in the United States alone. But medical applications of invasive BCI are just the beginning. The technology’s most far-reaching and profound impacts will come as BCI is adopted across the broader population. Consider the following possibilities, all of which should in principle be feasible: People will be able to communicate via direct brain-to-brain telepathy, bypassing the need for language altogether. Language is, after all, a lossy and imprecise way to compress and transmit one’s higher-dimensional inner thoughts and experiences to other people. It will become possible to directly convey states of mind without using words—to transmit ideas, feelings and memories to one another instantaneously. Natural language is one of humanity’s most important inventions. It is the bedrock of human civilization. BCI could eventually render it obsolete. Going beyond one-on-one communication to group interaction, BCI technology will unlock radical new forms of collective intelligence: groups of human scientists, engineers or entrepreneurs could literally “mind meld” to tackle complex problems or produce new creations in ways that individuals never could. Humans will integrate more closely with AI than ever before. Your thoughts will be continuously augmented by an artificial intelligence connected directly to your mind. Think a question and an answer will surface in your awareness; brainstorm on a topic and you will have an infinitely knowledgeable thought partner brainstorming with you in real-time. AI systems will become a natural extension and multiplier of your own cognitive processes. Ultimately, no clear dividing line will exist between human intelligence and artificial intelligence. Imagine being able to instantly gain new skills—say, karate or scuba diving or golf—merely by “uploading” them to your brain, directly reinforcing the appropriate neural pathways. Or, imagine being able to recall and relive any memory with perfect “sensory fidelity.” Imagine, too, how entertainment and art will change. Totally immersive experiences that engage all five senses with complete fidelity will be possible, far more powerful and authentic than anything virtual reality could achieve. It will be possible to experience, in the truest sense of that word, what it feels like to visit the Taj Mahal or to be a pharaoh in ancient Egypt. Artists will be able to transmit particular emotions and states of mind to their audiences instead of creating works of art that merely hint at them. BCI should also make it possible to reprogram your brain to see or feel things that today’s human brains cannot directly sense: Wi-Fi signals, or radio waves, or the direction “true north.” Along similar lines, synesthesia (the intermingling of different senses) on demand will become possible: imagine seeing music as colors, or hearing a painting, or tasting a mathematical formula. The future will be weird and wonderful. Keep an eye out for our followup article on this topic, focused on non-invasive BCI technologies and startups, which will be published in a few weeks.

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/05/2025 1:36:33 PM PDT by marcusmaximus US senators Charles Grassley and Richard Durbin have raised concerns about major corporations, including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Cognizant, for filing thousands of H-1B skilled worker visa petitions even as they conducted large-scale layoffs of American employees. Other companies questioned include Amazon, Apple, Deloitte, Google, JPMorgan Chase, Meta, Microsoft, and Walmart. The inquiry comes amid high unemployment in the US tech sector, which exceeds the overall national jobless rate. Recent American graduates with STEM degrees are reportedly struggling to find jobs, prompting the senators to question why companies are replacing US workers with foreign visa holders, as per PTI reports. Allegations Against TCS And Cognizant TCS announced plans to lay off over 12,000 employees, including Americans, while applying to hire 5,505 foreign H-1B workers in 2025. The company is also under investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly replacing older American staff with H-1B visa holders. Cognizant similarly laid off thousands of workers and applied for 2,493 H-1B employees. A 2024 federal jury found Cognizant favored South Asian H-1B workers over American staff, resulting in punitive damages. Other Tech Companies Under Scrutiny Amazon laid off tens of thousands of employees while applying for 10,044 H-1B visas. Google cut large numbers of employees, including managers, and applied for 4,181 foreign hires. Meta laid off 3,600 employees while applying for 5,123 H-1B workers. Microsoft laid off 16,000 employees but applied for 5,189 H-1B visas despite reporting record profits. (Excerpt) Read more at timesnownews.com ...

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/05/2025 11:16:50 AM PDT by marcusmaximus Sudden layoffs from jobs are tough to process and it gets worse when questions of employees remain unanswered. In one such case, an Indian employee detailed his sudden layoff from a US-based company in a Reddit post which has gone viral. According to the post, the employee was caught off guard by the termination, which took place on October 1, over a three-minute video call. “It was literally like any other day, woke up at 8:30, logged into work at 9 and saw a calendar invite for 11. It was a mandatory meeting with our COO for all India employees. I joined it at 11, he joined at 11:01, disabled everyone’s cameras and mics, casually let us know that they had “made the difficult decision of letting most of their Indian work force go”,’ the post read. The employee clarified that the layoffs were not performance-based but part of an internal organisational restructuring. ‘No time to prepare’ Sharing the emotional impact of the layoff, the Reddit post further stated that the three-minute video call left Indian employees “shocked, stunned, frustrated, stressed”. “No prior intimation, no time to prepare. They have offered October’s salary to paid at the end of the month and any leaves would be encashed. None of it even remotely makes up for what I’m feeling right now. This is the first time I’ve been laid off and it just truly…sucks,” read the post. (Excerpt) Read more at financialexpress.com ...

Title: Running the Numbers: Will 60/40 Split of Stocks, Bonds Still Yield Retirement Security?
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/finance/markets/a-midcentury-innovation/
Time Published: 2025-10-05T13:30:00Z
Full Content:
Is Wall Street’s golden ratio, the 60/40 division of portfolios between stocks and bonds, losing its luster? Sean Craig sean.craig@thedailyupside.com The origin of the 60/40 strategy lies in the research of American economist Harry Markowitz, a longtime professor of finance at the University of California, San Diego, who died in 2023. He was renowned for his 1950s work on modern portfolio theory, which argued investors should blend a mix of high-risk, high-return assets with low-risk, low-return assets. For his work on reducing investor exposure to risk through diversification, which was acclaimed for its “algebraic simplicity,” he won the 1990 Nobel Prize in Economics. By the early 1990s, the 60/40 portfolio had become a go-to interpretation of modern portfolio theory, and Markowitz’s work was widely embraced by individual and institutional investors alike. The idea is simple: Divide your asset portfolio into 60% equities and 40% fixed-income securities like government bonds, gaining exposure to the high returns of stock market booms while at the same time keeping a foothold in more stable bonds, whose lower but reliable returns can protect your wealth from bear markets. Distant and recent history make a direct case for the 60/40 approach. By measuring past market declines and the amount of time it took to recover from them, Morningstar calculated that the Great Depression was four times more painful for the stock market than it was for a 60/40 portfolio. The Lost Decade of the 2000s, which kicked off with the bursting of the dot-com bubble and ended with the Great Recession, was over seven times as painful for equities. In other words, even as the 60/40 portfolio has posted less overall growth than the stock market over the course of decades, it has proven more resilient in times of crisis, making it particularly attractive for individual retirement portfolios or pensions designed for stability. However, 2022 changed the arithmetic. Equities and bonds experienced a simultaneous decline amid two crises: Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine reorganized much of the global economy and energy markets along geopolitical lines, and a supply-chain crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global commerce. Both contributed to spiking inflation that has yet to fully subside. The stock market regained its 2022 high well over a year ago, in September 2024. But the bond market has been a totally different story: It remains underwater. That’s because of the Federal Reserve’s sustained and aggressive interest-rate hikes, which began in March 2022 and have been pared only marginally in the past year. Bond yields in 2022 were near the lowest in history, which means prices were high because of their inverse relationship with yields. The run of rate hikes, which boosted interest rates from nearly zero to over 4%, caused yields to spike and bond prices to crater. The bond market’s sustained pain has been so severe, Morningstar noted, that the typical 60/40 portfolio didn’t recover to its 2022 high until June 2025, roughly eight months after equities did so. That marked the only time in a century and a half that the 60/40 portfolio suffered more pain during a downturn than equities. The chief criticism of the 60/40 portfolio used to be that it offered less exposure to the greater potential upside of equities. Of course, that’s sort of the point, as it’s also meant to blunt their higher risk profile. But now, increasing attention is being paid to the risk that the economy remains in a state of relatively high inflation with relatively high interest rates. That would maintain pressure on bonds and, naturally, the 60/40 portfolio, prompting suggestions that it’s time for adjustments. Last month, Morgan Stanley Chief Investment Officer Mike Wilson argued for a new portfolio approach that allocates 60% to equities, 20% to fixed income and 20% to gold. “Gold is now the anti-fragile asset to own, rather than Treasurys,” he told the Reuters Global Markets Forum. “High-quality equities and gold are the best hedges.” Spot gold prices have surged 49% this year to record highs of over $3,800 per ounce, and Wall Street expects them to continue rising into next year. Wilson’s argument hinges on the idea that equities are linked to growth and risk tolerance, while gold is a safe-haven asset that traditionally rallies in times of uncertainty and when rates fall. Last year, Morgan Stanley also suggested that investors consider weighting equities more heavily in their portfolios for a potentially “better risk/reward balance” if generative AI, which has powered the stock market’s rally, continues to thrive and bond markets remain subdued. Last week, JPMorgan’s private bank arm, which serves high-net-worth individuals, recommended a 60/30/10 portfolio that includes a 10% stake in hedge funds. This mix, the bank said, has outperformed the 60/40 portfolio 70% of the time in the past decade and every year since 2021. JPMorgan pros also suggested considering investments in private markets, such as private equity, since companies are taking longer to go public than in previous decades, which has reduced the amount of post-IPO value that investors can capture in public markets. “The median tech IPO is now ~14 years old with ~$220 million in sales compared to ~7 years, and below $20 million in the late 1990s,” the bank’s analysts wrote. “In fact, today’s top private companies (SpaceX, ByteDance, OpenAI) would already rank among the top 30 S&P 500 companies by market cap if they were public.” That could affect not only institutional investors and pension funds that practice 60/40, but also retail investors, since investment firms have taken steps (some controversially) to increase their access to private markets. One final consideration that disrupts the 60/40 strategy, according to Edelman Financial Services cofounder Ric Edelman, is life itself. Or, more accurately, lifespan itself. “We are living longer than ever before as a species; nowhere in human history have humans lived this long,” he told CNBC in May, noting the previously unthinkable ranks of octogenarians and nonagenarians alive today thanks to improvements in healthcare and living conditions. The 60/40 portfolio, he said, is “dead because of longevity” and argued a 70% to 80% allocation to equities is a more reasonable ratio for those who want their savings to carry them into old age. “If you die at 80, it’s not a problem, but if you live to 90 or 100, or 110, it’s an issue,” he added. Fitting for 2025, a government shutdown is all but guaranteed to deliver even more uncertainty into the macroeconomic mix. A US regulator last week cleared the path for more retail investors to participate in day trading by dropping barriers put up in 2001. In a speech in Rhode Island, Jerome Powell reminded Wall Street and the world that The Fed remains in a “challenging situation.” Lachlan Murdoch’s moves so far are clearly those of someone who came of age during an era of rapidly advancing digitization. American Express justifies the hike with more than $3,500 in benefits, including credits that go towards dining, flights, and entertainment. The hope for the S&P 500’s small-cap cousin after the Fed’s rate cut tells an important story about the broader economy. President Trump wants to end mandated quarterly financial reports for publicly traded companies. Odds are his dream comes true. Demand for copper, already one of the most commonly used metals in the world, has surged amid the AI computing boom. The return-to-office orders have taken on new weight amid a softening labor market and broader economic anxiety. Morgan Stanley analysts think the US economy has been in a “rolling recession” since 2022 — and it may already be almost over. Investor appetite for StubHub and Klarna is especially compelling at a time when consumer sentiment starting to slump. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Tom Dunne recalls 'torturous path' to starting a family

Tom Dunne has recalled the "torturous path" to starting a family, saying there were times when he "wondered was this ever going to happen". The musician-turned-radio broadcaster appears in the latest episode of the new series of Keys To My Life, the RTÉ show in which presenter Brendan Courtney meets Irish personalities who reveal how the places they've lived in have shaped their lives. In an emotional and wide-ranging episode, Dunne recalls his years fronting the acclaimed Irish band Something Happens, known for their hit singles Parachute and Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello (Petrol). Despite the band calling it quits after they were dropped from their label Virgin Records following the release of their third album, Dunne said he has only fond memories of that time. "I never take away from what we did," he said. "Being in Something Happens was the thing I felt most alive doing. It was a great experience." The mid-90s marked a decline in the band's fortunes, but 1996 proved to be a golden year for Dunne when he met his future wife, Audrey. Three years later, they moved to Blackrock and in 2002 they got married in The Plaza Hotel in New York. However, one piece of life's puzzle was still eluding the couple. Becoming emotional about their attempts to start a family together, Dunne said: "There was a torturous path to that, IVF, and there was times when you really wondered was this ever going to happen." Dunne, who shares daughters Eva and Sky with his wife, continued: "We were just getting knocked back a lot, it seemed. "It goes so easy for so many people and is so difficult for so many other people. When we became pregnant that was the greatest day ever. We stuck at it and got our reward, two very special young ladies." In 2017, Dunne received a shocking health diagnosis with the discovery of a malformed heart valve that could end his life at any moment. He recalled: "I got a phone call to go in and see the surgeon. He said I had a 70% chance of dying within the next two years. It just stops opening and then you're dead, there's no warning about it." Dunne said he had surgery to replace the damaged valve with a pig valve. "It's like a miracle," he said. "I love my life, I really do. I didn't want to change things afterwards, I just wanted to have more of it. I love music, I love my family, I love everything." When asked by Courtney if he had any big takeout from that time in his life, he said: "I certainly enjoy every moment. "I think the most searing thing was holding Sky's hand, at the time she was about eight, and she's just a beautiful girl. And I just thought, 'This is so precious'. "Life is full of those precious little moments, you're holding somebody's hand. Worth their weight in gold." Keys To My Life airs on RTÉ One and RTÉ Player at 8:30pm on Sunday, 5 October.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. UPDATE, October 6, 2025: This article was originally published on October 4, 2025. It has been updated after AMD announced it had entered into a multi-year deal to provide chips to OpenAI. Lisa Su is the engineer behind one of the most dramatic corporate turnarounds in the tech industry. The Taiwanese American CEO is widely credited with transforming AMD from a struggling semiconductor firm on the brink of collapse into a global powerhouse competing head-to-head with Intel and Nvidia. On Monday, the company announced that it had agreed to a massive multi-year deal to provide its AI chips to OpenAI. The announcement sent AMD's stock soaring as much as 27% in premarket trading. When Su joined AMD in 2012, the company's market value was under $2 billion. Within a decade of her leadership, AMD's innovations in high-performance computing and graphics, especially the Ryzen CPUs and EPYC server processors, catapulted the company's value to roughly $270 billion as of October 2025. But Su's leadership has not been without challenges. AMD's two largest competitors, Nvidia and Intel, are now working together in a strategic collaboration. Under the second Trump administration, export regulations related to China, one of AMD's largest markets, are also constantly changing. Here's a look at the timeline of Su's career, from her early life in New York City to her role as one of the most influential women in tech and innovation: Lisa Tzwu-Fang Su was born in Tainan, Taiwan, in 1969, to Su Chun-hwai and Sandy Lo. Her family immigrated to the US when she was around the age of three, because her father, a statistician, was pursuing his graduate studies at the University of Texas in Austin. Her mother at that time was an accountant. The family eventually settled down in Queens, New York City. As a child, Su liked to take apart and rebuild remote-controlled cars and other gadgets, which sparked her interest in engineering. She eventually attended The Bronx High School of Science and graduated in 1986. Su attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston for many years and focused on electrical engineering. She eventually completed her bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees all at MIT throughout the 1990s. Su's doctoral work on MOSFETs — tiny electronic switches inside computer chips — helped cement her future in some of the world's best-known semiconductor companies. After leaving the academic environment, Su worked in engineering, research, and managerial positions at Texas Instruments, IBM, and Freescale Semiconductor. As the lead scientist at the IBM Semiconductor R&D Center, she contributed to the development of copper interconnects in chips, replacing aluminum ones. Her later role as senior vice president and general manager at Freescale, where she prepared the company for its IPO, gave Su the experience she needed to take on roles beyond research. Su joined AMD in 2012 as the general manager of Global Business Units. AMD's market cap that year was a little less than $2 billion. At that time, most of AMD's revenue came from traditional chips for PCs. However, the PC market was shrinking in the early 2010s while demand for smartphones and tablets was booming. AMD began to adopt a "semi-custom" approach, which involved taking its core technologies and modifying them based on individual customer needs. This approach helped secure contracts to design and manufacture chips for Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One, which reduced reliance on the PC market. In October 2014, Su was promoted to become President and CEO of AMD. In 2014, AMD had a large but scattered portfolio of chips for PCs, embedded systems, graphics, and low-power mobile, but the lack of focus was causing the company to lose market share to Nvidia and Intel. In a change of direction for the company, Su decided to discard the market of low-power chips with small margins to focus on producing high-end chips for the cloud, data centers, and consoles. The development of the Ryzen chips helped revive its market share among consumer products, while the simultaneous launch of the EPYC processor chips helped carve its share among data centers and servers. Companies with a large demand for cloud, like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google Cloud, have all been adopting EPYC chips. In 2018, AMD also managed to launch the world's first 7-nanometer data center GPUs, namely the Radeon Instinct MI50 and MI60. By 2020, AMD's market cap had reached over $110 billion. Before Su started gracing magazine covers, she went viral in a clip from the 2018 Chinese Grand Prix, where Formula 1 commentator Martin Brundle yelled, "Excuse me, Ma'am, do you speak English?" at the CEO, who was sponsoring the event. "I'm with AMD," Su said, a response that immediately gained her the internet reputation of being humble. The original clip on YouTube has garnered more than 750,000 views and continues to circulate on Instagram Reels as an example of humility. In 2022, Su became the first MIT alumna to make a gift for a building that will bear her own name. Originally called Building 12, the home of MIT.nano was renamed the Lisa T. Su Building. Su also regularly appears at MIT's doctoral commencement ceremonies and established the Lisa Su Fellowship Fund, which supports female graduate students at MIT who have made accomplishments in nanotechnology. Su leads a very private life outside her role at AMD. Her spouse is Daniel Lin, but it is unclear when the pair got married or if they have children. There are no verifiable records of Lin's profession, and he is not a public figure, though the pair often appear in public events together. Su told Wired what keeps her going: She boxes with a trainer at her house for exercise, enjoys a good passion tea lemonade from Starbucks, and gets between five and six hours of sleep every night — seven on weekends. Su's work at AMD was recognized by Time magazine in 2024, which named her CEO of the Year. She became the first woman to receive this title. Su and Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia and the biggest competitor to AMD, are actually related. They are first cousins, once removed, with Huang being the elder. Su's maternal grandfather is the eldest brother of Huang's mother. Despite both immigrating to the US from Taiwan as children, they did not grow up together and had never met until well into their respective careers. AMD's business has grown more than a hundred times since Su took the wheel, but it is still just a fraction of the size of the $4.4 trillion Nvidia. When asked if she thinks she could outcompete Nvidia, Su told Wired in an August interview that she doesn't necessarily want to be compared to Intel and Nvidia, because "the market is humongous" and she sees plenty of opportunities. On September 18, Intel and Nvidia announced a strategic collaboration to develop AI infrastructure and personal computing products together, sending Intel shares up 23% as of market close on the same day and denting AMD's stock. The collaboration is anticipated to create significant pressure on AMD by combining Nvidia's AI expertise with Intel's hardware. In March, a team of analysts from SemiAnalysis published a report that AMD's graphics processing unit is still inferior to that of Nvidia's, because AMD's existing software is preventing the chip from reaching its full potential. But Su was not angry. Instead, she hopped on a 90-minute call with the SemiAnalysis's lead analyst the next day to hear him out. "Feedback is a gift even when it's critical," Su wrote in a post on X after the call, "We have put a ton of work into customer and workload optimizations, but there is lots more we can do to enable the broad ecosystem." Similar to Nvidia's H20 chips, AMD has developed chips specifically for the Chinese market in response to past US export control regulations, namely the MI308 AI chips. In April, AMD estimated that the company would take a $800 million hit in revenue after Trump announced more stringent chip export controls that would ban MI308 from reaching its intended market. "We lead today because we have the best technology. However, if we're not able to fully have our technology adopted in the rest of the world, there will be other technologies that will come to play," said Su in a US Senate hearing in May regarding export controls. "They may not be as good as we are today, but frankly, usage really spurs innovation." In July, the restriction was lifted, and AMD said it would resume compliant shipments to China. By September, both Nvidia and AMD agreed to share 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China with the US government, in exchange for maintaining their export licenses. On September 4, Su attended an AI task force meeting at the White House, led by first lady Melania Trump, and subsequently attended a dinner event hosted by Trump alongside some of the biggest names in tech, including Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Su had previously endorsed the Trump administration's AI Action Plan, though she was not a member of a formal advisory board. In a September interview with Fox Business, Su said the AI Action Plan is an "excellent blueprint for what it takes for America to lead." The AI Action Plan has faced criticism for attempting to override state-level AI governance and withholding AI infrastructure funding from states with more stringent regulations. On Monday, AMD announced it had agreed to a multi-billion-dollar partnership to supply its artificial intelligence chips to OpenAI. The move gives AMD a significant boost against Nvidia. The multi-year deal, announced Monday, will see OpenAI deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD GPUs, with the first 1 gigawatt deployment set to begin in the second half of 2026. It gives OpenAI the opportunity to take a roughly 10% stake in AMD, with shares vesting as the companies hit deployment targets and AMD hits share price targets. "This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realize AI's full potential," Sam Altman, cofounder and CEO of OpenAI, said. Jump to

Title: More CEOs want Elon Musk–style ‘moonshot’ pay packages—but comp experts are raising alarms

Amanda Gerut is the west coast editor at Fortune, overseeing publicly traded businesses, executive compensation, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, and investigations. The all-or-nothing moonshot pay plan was a gambit so risky even Axon Enterprise CEO Rick Smith’s wife was against it. But Smith had started getting antsy around 2016, as he was approaching three decades at the company, Axon compensation committee chair Hadi Partovi told Fortune. Smith was talking more seriously to the board about his succession plan, who was next to lead the company, and what he would do next. Partovi knew Smith could make a lot more money if he launched a startup than if he made Axon worth 10 times as much under his previous comp plan. “This is when I realized we had a real problem,” said Partovi. Smith thrives in high-risk, high-reward environments, so the Axon board granted Smith a near carbon copy of Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s moonshot pay plan but on a much smaller scale. The challenge to Smith was to grow the Taser stun gun and body-camera maker 10-fold over a 10-year performance period starting in 2018. From a base of $2.5 billion, Smith had to increase the company’s market cap by $1 billion to unlock each new tranche of stock options, for a total of 12 tranches and a market cap of $13.5 billion. In addition, Smith had to hit eight revenue-based operational or eight adjusted-Ebitda-based goals. During the decade he was supposed to work on achieving those goals, he would get almost nothing—no bonuses or other incentives, and his salary was about $31,000 a year. “In full candor, my wife was against me taking on the challenge, as she saw it as just too risky,” Smith wrote in a letter to investors in 2023. But Smith blew through all the goals and each of the 12 tranches in five years—half the time the board gave him—making Smith the highest-paid CEO last year with compensation valued at $165 million. The stock price grew more than 600% between 2018 when the board offered him the moonshot and 2023. After he unlocked the 12th tranche, Smith negotiated an $88 million reduction on his next performance plan (which will keep him at Axon until at least 2030 with a goal of driving the stock to $943.75) and directed it be granted to the lowest-paid workers at Axon, showering them with surprise stock grants based on their years of tenure at the company. “The best is yet to come,” Smith wrote to investors in his letter this year. Smith shooting the moon—twice, potentially—represents a resurgent breed of executive compensation that has captured the imaginations of a growing number of CEOs. Moonshot wanderlust initially kicked into high gear after Elon Musk’s groundbreaking 2017 award from Tesla, once valued as high as $56 billion before it was twice rescinded owing to a legal challenge. Moonshot grants, not to be confused with an outsize stock grant known as a “mega grant” for its sheer size, tie CEO compensation almost entirely to aggressive, seemingly impossible performance targets, explained Eric Hoffmann, vice president and chief data officer at comp consulting firm Farient Advisors. CEOs don’t get the awards unless they hit specific valuation hurdles and operational goals, he said, and the performance periods are typically five, seven or 10 years, rather than the more standard three-year period. “It should be difficult to get these awards,” said Hoffmann. “You have to create a lot of value in order to earn these kinds of awards.” Traditional CEO pay packages include a base salary, an annual cash bonus, and a longer-term equity incentive award often based on time and performance goals. According to compensation data firm Equilar, median compensation among S&P 500 CEOs was $17.1 million in 2024, up nearly 10% over the year prior. Moonshot awards, however, upend the traditional compensation model while also bucking the trend of billionaire tech founders like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Google’s Larry Page, and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, who all held large equity stakes and focused on making them more valuable, noted Hoffmann. The key distinction is that those founders built wealth by focusing on increasing the value of their existing equity stakes, while taking minimal or no compensation, rather than seeking massive equity grants on top of their founder stakes, said Hoffmann. The moonshot model is a departure—seeking both founder equity upside plus additional compensation awards. “This way of wealth building is different than what was used during the dotcom era,” he noted. The upside to the moonshot is an enormous payout and a growing slice of company ownership if an executive can deliver transformational growth, but investors aren’t always wild about them, and moonshots don’t come without significant risk, said Todd Sirras, a managing director with consulting firm Semler Brossy who has advised clients on these deals. Companies are “willing to bet all of these ungodly amounts of money on one person thinking, ‘That’s the right machine we need for the factory,’” said Sirras. But there’s a fundamental flaw in this approach because people are unpredictable—unlike factory equipment. “Human beings are terrible machines,” Sirras told Fortune. “They’re emotional. Their attention gets divided thinking about what airplane they’re going to buy. It’s more risky to invest in a human being than it is to invest in a machine because human beings break in different and unpredictable ways.” Until now, the moonshot offers have been almost exclusive to founder-CEOs and almost always established pre-IPO, said Sirras. Semler Brossy’s database of about 80 moonshot awards includes dozens issued during the SPAC IPO boom of 2020 and 2021 that are now “dead in the water” because companies failed to meet their valuation targets, he added. With fewer IPOs in recent years and fewer moonshots, there are about 16 that exist among large publicly traded companies—and even fewer CEOs who have achieved maximum payouts, including Smith and Musk, according to research from Claire Kamas, a senior data analyst at Farient Advisors. Other companies that have awarded the grants include Airbnb, DoorDash, Oracle, ServiceNow, and RH, formerly known as Restoration Hardware, Kamas found. But the high-profile nature of the awards and the eye-popping figures associated with them are pushing board-level compensation committees that negotiate CEO pay to prepare for conversations about similar packages. Farient has gotten queries from compensation committee chairs who are already preparing for how they will address the situation when the CEO comes to them about a moonshot plan. In one case, the CEO isn’t a founder but a manager hired to run the company, Hoffmann noted. He isn’t a fan of moonshot awards, particularly in cases where CEOs already hold significant ownership stakes and control over their companies. “From a firm perspective, it is our view that these plans are generally not in the best interests of the organizations, the stakeholders, and shareholders in these companies,” said Hoffmann. “To me, a lot of these feel like a lottery ticket, a winner-take-all.” Despite the risk, Sirras sees these awards rising in popularity again, and he sees new trends emerging: Founders are granting moonshots to their “anointed successors,” he said. Real estate platform Opendoor Technologies this month granted a moonshot potentially worth $2.8 billion and an 11% slice of the company to new CEO Kaz Nejatian. Sirras said that award looks to be the first of its kind, and the board likely offered it to Nejatian because of a blessing from Opendoor’s cofounders, Eric Wu and Khosla Ventures’ Keith Rabois. Wu and Rabois returned to the board alongside Nejatian’s hiring and invested $40 million of equity capital into the company. Sirras said the same trend seems to be occurring in private equity. For instance, when founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts of KKR stepped down, the firm in 2021 granted co-CEOs Joe Bae and Scott Nuttall 1.2 million shares of KKR Holdings, valued at about $75 million, as part of their promotions. That same year, Apollo Global Management granted copresidents Jim Zelter and Scott Kleinman the potential to earn more than $860 million in stock. Zelter was promoted to president in 2025, and Marc Rowan remains CEO. In addition to controlling founders who are planning leadership transitions and “founder-anointed successors,” the new wave of awards will likely also go to leading-edge executives in scenarios in which founders are making investment decisions, said Sirras. The arms race for talent between OpenAI and Meta and the reported compensation packages Zuckerberg has offered come to mind, he added. “From a design perspective, the magnitude is mind-boggling,” said Sirras. He compared it to the Jurassic Park film series. “Danger increases exponentially the closer these awards get to the general executive population,” Sirras wrote in an email. Alongside moonshots for founder-anointed successors and non-successors with a major capital investment he deems “inside the T. rex fence,” the rise of “awards in non-founder companies means the dinosaurs have escaped and are heading to the mainland,” Sirras wrote. The awards can also prompt investors to revolt. Business payments company Corpay awarded CEO Ronald Clarke 850,000 performance-based stock options valued at $55.6 million in 2021. The award had stock price hurdles of $350 and $400 and Clarke got no long-term equity grants in 2020, 2022, and 2023. In 2024, the comp committee canceled 300,000 stock options subject to the $400 hurdle and modified the criterion for 550,000 stock options subject to the $350 hurdle to require that Corpay hit a closing stock price at or above $350 for at least three trading days by the end of 2024. Clarke achieved the modified hurdle on Oct. 23, 2024. Corpay told investors the change was meant to “align Mr. Clarke’s realized pay with that of shareholders who benefited from the increased stock level over $350 before the modification, but prior to the modification the stock had not closed above $350 for 10 consecutive days, which was the pre-modification hurdle.” In other words, the board made it simpler for Clarke to earn the stock options by reducing the target from 10 consecutive trading days above $350 to just three trading days, a hurdle he cleared shortly after the change. The stock didn’t hit $400 until February 2025 and is currently trading at just under $300. The company’s 2025 Say-on-Pay vote—a thumbs-up, thumbs-down nonbinding vote on executive pay—only got support from 53.5% of votes cast. Over the past 14 years, the Russell 3000 index saw average support of about 91% for pay programs. Corpay did not respond to a request for comment. At Axon, Smith’s moonshot deal differs from Musk’s in another key way: It’s open to Smith’s direct reports on down to line workers at Axon, making employees eligible for a version of Smith’s moonshot deal. Workers could give up some salary, put some of their pay at risk, and work to hit revenue targets. Plus, every employee in the U.S. got a grant of 60 performance stock units that vested according to the same milestones in Smith’s award—a move almost unheard of in corporate America. No one other than Smith was able to essentially give up all their pay, said Partovi, mostly because Smith was independently successful enough that if he didn’t cut it and got nothing, he had enough of a cushion. Roughly $75 million in employee compensation was locked up as at-risk pay so employees could take part in the moonshot. “I really think that was a driver behind why the company grew so fast,” said Partovi. “Any element of infighting was gone—everybody was suddenly like, ‘We’re all in this together.’” Smith’s 2023 award went through a significant negotiation process where Partovi heard directly from shareholders about everything they didn’t like about the first plan so he could debug it. The board also attempted to legal-proof it against the type of challenge that Musk’s moonshot faced, prompting one of the compensation committee members who had socialized with Smith to resign from the committee. The board also changed the vehicle type from performance options to restricted stock, added in speed brakes that would keep Smith at Axon, and made it more difficult for Smith to hit the last few tranches. Partovi said he addressed every question from shareholders about misalignment in the plan during the board’s negotiation process with Smith. Ultimately, Partovi credits the moonshot deal with transforming the corporate culture around shared risk and high reward with a version of a high-stakes compensation plan rolled out to everyone at the company. In his view, it helped to eliminate dynamics where direct reports and general employees resent outsize pay for the chief executive, he said. “The big thing is, the CEO is taking a risk in giving up his pay, and you don’t want it to turn out to be shareholders win and the CEO wins or shareholders lose and the CEO still wins,” said Partovi. “I don’t know if grants like Rick’s make sense for everybody, but they strongly make sense for Rick Smith at Axon.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

He isn’t a fan of moonshot awards, particularly in cases where CEOs already hold significant ownership stakes and control over their companies. “From a firm perspective, it is our view that these plans are generally not in the best interests of the organizations, the stakeholders, and shareholders in these companies,” said Hoffmann. “To me, a lot of these feel like a lottery ticket, a winner-take-all.” Despite the risk, Sirras sees these awards rising in popularity again, and he sees new trends emerging: Founders are granting moonshots to their “anointed successors,” he said. Real estate platform Opendoor Technologies this month granted a moonshot potentially worth $2.8 billion and an 11% slice of the company to new CEO Kaz Nejatian. Sirras said that award looks to be the first of its kind, and the board likely offered it to Nejatian because of a blessing from Opendoor’s cofounders, Eric Wu and Khosla Ventures’ Keith Rabois. Wu and Rabois returned to the board alongside Nejatian’s hiring and invested $40 million of equity capital into the company. Sirras said the same trend seems to be occurring in private equity. For instance, when founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts of KKR stepped down, the firm in 2021 granted co-CEOs Joe Bae and Scott Nuttall 1.2 million shares of KKR Holdings, valued at about $75 million, as part of their promotions. That same year, Apollo Global Management granted copresidents Jim Zelter and Scott Kleinman the potential to earn more than $860 million in stock. Zelter was promoted to president in 2025, and Marc Rowan remains CEO. In addition to controlling founders who are planning leadership transitions and “founder-anointed successors,” the new wave of awards will likely also go to leading-edge executives in scenarios in which founders are making investment decisions, said Sirras. The arms race for talent between OpenAI and Meta and the reported compensation packages Zuckerberg has offered come to mind, he added. “From a design perspective, the magnitude is mind-boggling,” said Sirras. He compared it to the Jurassic Park film series. “Danger increases exponentially the closer these awards get to the general executive population,” Sirras wrote in an email. Alongside moonshots for founder-anointed successors and non-successors with a major capital investment he deems “inside the T. rex fence,” the rise of “awards in non-founder companies means the dinosaurs have escaped and are heading to the mainland,” Sirras wrote. The awards can also prompt investors to revolt. Business payments company Corpay awarded CEO Ronald Clarke 850,000 performance-based stock options valued at $55.6 million in 2021. The award had stock price hurdles of $350 and $400 and Clarke got no long-term equity grants in 2020, 2022, and 2023. In 2024, the comp committee canceled 300,000 stock options subject to the $400 hurdle and modified the criterion for 550,000 stock options subject to the $350 hurdle to require that Corpay hit a closing stock price at or above $350 for at least three trading days by the end of 2024. Clarke achieved the modified hurdle on Oct. 23, 2024. Corpay told investors the change was meant to “align Mr. Clarke’s realized pay with that of shareholders who benefited from the increased stock level over $350 before the modification, but prior to the modification the stock had not closed above $350 for 10 consecutive days, which was the pre-modification hurdle.” In other words, the board made it simpler for Clarke to earn the stock options by reducing the target from 10 consecutive trading days above $350 to just three trading days, a hurdle he cleared shortly after the change. The stock didn’t hit $400 until February 2025 and is currently trading at just under $300. The company’s 2025 Say-on-Pay vote—a thumbs-up, thumbs-down nonbinding vote on executive pay—only got support from 53.5% of votes cast. Over the past 14 years, the Russell 3000 index saw average support of about 91% for pay programs. Corpay did not respond to a request for comment. At Axon, Smith’s moonshot deal differs from Musk’s in another key way: It’s open to Smith’s direct reports on down to line workers at Axon, making employees eligible for a version of Smith’s moonshot deal. Workers could give up some salary, put some of their pay at risk, and work to hit revenue targets. Plus, every employee in the U.S. got a grant of 60 performance stock units that vested according to the same milestones in Smith’s award—a move almost unheard of in corporate America. No one other than Smith was able to essentially give up all their pay, said Partovi, mostly because Smith was independently successful enough that if he didn’t cut it and got nothing, he had enough of a cushion. Roughly $75 million in employee compensation was locked up as at-risk pay so employees could take part in the moonshot. “I really think that was a driver behind why the company grew so fast,” said Partovi. “Any element of infighting was gone—everybody was suddenly like, ‘We’re all in this together.’” Smith’s 2023 award went through a significant negotiation process where Partovi heard directly from shareholders about everything they didn’t like about the first plan so he could debug it. The board also attempted to legal-proof it against the type of challenge that Musk’s moonshot faced, prompting one of the compensation committee members who had socialized with Smith to resign from the committee. The board also changed the vehicle type from performance options to restricted stock, added in speed brakes that would keep Smith at Axon, and made it more difficult for Smith to hit the last few tranches. Partovi said he addressed every question from shareholders about misalignment in the plan during the board’s negotiation process with Smith. Ultimately, Partovi credits the moonshot deal with transforming the corporate culture around shared risk and high reward with a version of a high-stakes compensation plan rolled out to everyone at the company. In his view, it helped to eliminate dynamics where direct reports and general employees resent outsize pay for the chief executive, he said. “The big thing is, the CEO is taking a risk in giving up his pay, and you don’t want it to turn out to be shareholders win and the CEO wins or shareholders lose and the CEO still wins,” said Partovi. “I don’t know if grants like Rick’s make sense for everybody, but they strongly make sense for Rick Smith at Axon.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

If you can invest in music royalties, why can't you also invest in "technology royalties?" That's what Althera42 wants to make possible, betting on revenue growth and scalability of technology startups without having to buy in at high valuations. Founded by Caspar Macqueen, a former BlackRock executive, and Christian Czernich, founder of the private credit firm Round2 Capital, the new fund plans to provide working capital to technology companies in Europe without taking an equity stake. Althera42 will focus on investing in intellectual property that transforms society through agentic AI, data infrastructure, defense and security, robotics and automation, software-enabled services and health and well-being. Don't Miss: "Althera42's royalty investments allow companies to access capital without diluting equity or taking on rigid debt obligations," Business Insider reported from a company factsheet released in September. According to its website, Althera42 looks to invest in founder-led and late-stage private companies that have software and proprietary technology at their core. Althera42 will build customized deals to receive a fixed percentage of the technology companies' future revenue over several years. Through the royalties model, Althera42 can combine the upside of venture capital with the consistent cash flow of private debt, Czernich told Business Insider. Fund gains will go out to investors quarterly. The fund will charge a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee. Althera42 is targeting companies with annual revenue between roughly $17 million and $117 million (€10 million and €100 million) from recurring or licensing models. Trending: Kevin O'Leary Loves ‘Wonderful Recurring Cash Flows' — These Small Industrial Assets Deliver Just That Royalty investing is the new capital paradigm in an intellectual property-based global economy, according to the company's website. In its stated mission, Althera42 wants to establish technology royalties as a new asset class. It hopes to copy the successful playbook used for tapping into the predictable revenue streams of music and pharmaceuticals. Althera42's website boasts being architects of a new capital model, "transforming recurring revenue into investable royalty streams." Czernich told Business Insider, "I do genuinely believe it will be a new asset class." See Also: Microsoft's Climate Innovation Fund Just Backed This Farmland Manager — Accredited Investors Can Join the Same Fund Althera42 believes royalty investing aligns its success with that of the company it funds. However, the firm does so by empowering companies to "retain control, by accelerating their impact with capital support that does not compromise their vision or leadership." According to Pitcher Partners, a national association of independent accounting firms in Australia, royalty investing is found across several industries: music, energy, mining, pharmaceuticals and software. Major private equity firms Blackstone and KKR entered the music industry in 2021 and 2022, deploying $500 million to $1 billion, and the energy royalties sector in North America is estimated to be worth between $500 billion and $1 trillion, according to Pitcher Partners' website. Macqueen, formerly BlackRock's head of U.K., Middle East and Africa for the alternatives business Aladdin, told Business Insider the firm plans to pull in $300 million with its first fund and complete 15 to 20 deals. Most deals would likely be in Europe and the U.K., potentially with some North American investments. Althera42 has offices in London and New York.

Title: This Promise Of 70% Dividends From These ETFs Is Totally Bogus
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/10/04/this-promise-of-70-dividends-from-these-etfs-is-totally-bogus/

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. What if you could squeeze, say, a 70% dividend yield from a fast-growing AI stock like NVIDIA (NVDA) or Palantir (PLTR)? Sounds great, right? Instead of relying just on these stocks’ prices for your profits (since dividends are, frankly, the furthest thing from their CFOs’ minds), you get their returns as high-yielding dividends. That’s something a new breed of ETFs is promising. These funds, which are gaining in popularity, hold just one stock—usually a Palantir, Tesla (TSLA) or NVIDIA—and trade options on that one stock to deliver stated yields often way above 50%. Does it work? First, let me say that, as someone who has covered 8%+ yielding closed-end funds (CEFs) for over a decade, I get the sentiment behind these funds. Big income streams can create financial independence—who wouldn’t want as big of a yield as possible? But there’s a line where a dividend goes from appealing to dangerous—and it’s well below the stated 70% distribution rate, as of this writing, on a single-stock ETF like, say, the YieldMax AI Option Income Strategy ETF (AIYY). That’s because, what these funds’ massive yields give, their share prices can easily take away. Consider the YieldMax AI Option Income Strategy ETF (AIYY), which aims to deliver that 70% income stream by holding C3.ai (AI), a developer of AI apps for business. As I write this, AIYY investors have seen a total return of nearly negative 50% since the start of the year. With nearly half of their capital now lost in 2025 (with dividends included), those holding AIYY must be wondering what went wrong. Let’s start with that dividend, because there’s a key thing to note here: Even though AIYY’s website says its distribution rate is 71%, it also tells us that the fund’s 30-day SEC yield is only 4.8%. This means the fund’s net investment income (which can only be calculated by a strict SEC-mandated formula and excludes options income, which can be unpredictable) is much lower than that 70%—which is the payout as a percentage of the fund’s assets. Moreover, AIYY’s distributions keep falling, down 63% in 2025. Let me clear—not all of YieldMax’s 57 ETFs are losing money this year. In fact, most are up. The best return goes to the YieldMax PLTR Option Income Strategy ETF (PLTY), with a stated 49.4% yield. This fund has returned 77.9% for 2025 and is up much more since its inception in late 2024. So, have we found the secret to financial independence here? After all, with this 49.4% income stream, it takes only about $203,000 in upfront investment to get a six-figure income stream! Except, well, there’s a lot of risk behind this seemingly impressive chart. As you probably guessed from the fund name, this ETF tracks Palantir, whose stock has surged as the company wins more government contracts. If you predicted PLTR’s surge, congratulations—that’s impressive. But an investor who knew to invest in PLTR should’ve just bought that stock instead, since PLTY (in purple below) has badly lagged it. This problem is endemic to single-stock ETFs: These funds try to “translate” growth stocks’ gains into big dividends, but in so doing expose us to the risks of a single stock, with less upside. Sure, the income is great when the stock is rising, but that income will shrink if the stock drops. That’s what happened to the 56.2%-yielding YieldMax MRNA Option Income Strategy ETF (MRNY), which holds Moderna (MRNA) and is down 39% in 2025 and down even more since its IPO in early 2024. Anyone who bought MRNY and enjoyed the huge yields at the start of 2024 probably thought they were really on to something, as the fund’s total return rose into the spring. They then saw their fortunes reverse as the fund’s price fell. That’s the fate I expect for the aforementioned PLTY if the stock it tracks—again, Palantir—drops. And I see that as likely, since Palantir’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is at a stratospheric 278 as I write this. So what are these funds for, then? To be honest, I’m not sure. As we’ve seen, investors are almost always better off just buying the underlying stocks. What’s more, some of these ETF issuers are venturing into even riskier territory, like the recently released “Bonk Income Blast ETF,” which doesn’t just invest in crypto, but also in “other crypto ETFs, including non-US crypto-ETFs,” according to its SEC filing. This means investors will wind up paying the fees for this ETF, as well as fees for the ETFs it owns. Plus they’re exposing themselves to the risks of the crypto market and the risks of foreign markets—including potentially lax regulation—too. There’s just no reason to take risks like those when you can get predictable, diversified dividends from CEFs. Sure, CEFs don’t offer the mind-blowing yields of YieldMax and its ilk. But we’ll happily take that “lower” payout—bearing in mind many CEFs yield more than 8%, if it lets us sleep peacefully at night. Moreover, we benefit from CEFs discounts to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios), which hold the potential for future upside. ETFs—single stock or no—never offer us a discount. I think you’ll agree that this is a far better deal than a 70%-yielder that’s dropped around 50% in less than a year.

Title: The War Over Defense Tech

Last October, on a Martin Luther–inspired website called www.18theses.com, a software executive named Shyam Sankar published a four-thousand-word polemic with the title “The Defense Reformation.” “As a nation, we are in an undeclared state of emergency,” it begins. There follows a litany of provocations: Chinese escalation in the South China Sea, Iranian attacks on US military bases, the October 7 attacks in Israel, “an estimated 1 million casualties in brutal combat in Ukraine.” All this, Sankar writes, amounts to “a hot Cold War II.” It is a war, he argues, for which the US is catastrophically underprepared: “In the current environment, American industries can’t produce a minimum line of ships, subs, munitions, aircraft, and more.” The problem lies with American capitalism in its present form, which—as Sankar lamented last year on a military podcast called The Merge—has left legacy defense firms like Lockheed Martin dominated by “fifth-generation MBA cadre[s]” who care more “about cash flow and buybacks and dividends than…about the honest hard work of engineering innovation.” Under these conditions the defense department’s subsidies for private business, he writes in “The Defense Reformation,” have neither “the supposed advantages of a planned economy nor the (far superior) advantages of a free market.” Sankar is the CTO and executive vice-president of Palantir, the start-up cofounded in 2003 by Peter Thiel that specializes in a peculiar hybrid of big-data manipulation and McKinsey-style consulting work. Many of Sankar’s Palantir colleagues and peers at other Thielworld start-ups—notably Anduril, which bills itself as a pioneering disruptor in software-heavy military hardware—have advanced a similar criticism of the neoliberal state, bemoaning its declining interventions in manufacturing and research and lambasting the legacy defense firms, often nicknamed “primes,” for their sclerosis, inefficiency, and alleged monopolistic behavior. The innovative, capitalist spirit and manly vitalism that defined the defense department through the cold war is, for this group, long gone. The task of the hour, as Sankar writes in “The Defense Reformation,” is therefore nothing less than “to resurrect the American Industrial Base.” You might think this would mean something like what, under the previous administration, went by the name Bidenomics: initiatives such as the CHIPS Act or the Inflation Reduction Act, which paled in comparison to total federal defense spending—the combined estimated cost of those two bills, which would be spread over a number of years, was about half the annual defense bill—but nonetheless aimed to bring high-tech manufacturing back to US shores. You would be wrong. “The most important and malleable weapons system,” Sankar writes, is not missiles or other military hardware but software, by which he presumably means technologies like large-scale data manipulation, narrow forms of computerized optimization applied to “smart” weapons systems and robotics, sensors, autonomous weapons systems, and artificial intelligence. Investing lavishly in such technology and teaching “our warriors…to wield the software industrial base to maximize lethality” will catalyze what Sankar has elsewhere called a “software-driven reindustrialization” akin to previous industrial revolutions based around water, steam, coal, or oil. For a range of figures in the emergent defense-tech sector to which Palantir and Anduril belong, this will require wrenching guaranteed contracts from the bloated primes and promoting competition by having branches of the armed services bid against one another, not to mention allowing even more sales elsewhere. It will also require binding the state closer to a range of tech giants—especially firms like Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft­—that have thus far, on this view, neglected their patriotic duty to engage in defense work and profited from feminized “ad-tech” instead. These arguments have found a broad and receptive audience. In recent years a range of politicians have aligned themselves with the priorities of defense-tech firms, especially as successive White Houses worry about a belligerent Russia, a rising China, and the vulnerabilities exposed by Covid-induced supply shocks—all of which have reenergized a longstanding criticism of Reagan-era political-economic shifts that hobbled productive industries. The Obama and Biden administrations both empowered tech companies at the expense of the primes; Biden, skeptical of free trade and hawkish on China, courted Silicon Valley firms that promised to bring back domestic manufacturing and reindustrialize the rust belt and former defense hubs. But in recent years talk about “software-driven reindustrialization” has become especially widespread on a faction of the new right. That the Trump adviser and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer could rail on X against Lockheed Martin, with its “woke agenda,” for “delivering F-35 fighter jets that are simply not ready for combat”—and that Elon Musk could respond to her that, in any case, “crewed aircraft will be destroyed instantly by cheap drone swarms”—owes much to the rhetoric of Sankar and his peers. This new Silicon Valley defense-tech and finance group—their grievances, ideology, and policy visions—has become central to Trump’s second term. Several defense-tech boosters have assumed powerful positions in the administration, most notably one of Anduril’s former senior directors, Michael Obadal, who was just confirmed as Army under secretary, the second-highest ranking civilian official in the Army. Since January Palantir and Anduril have received many billions in contracts, with more on the way. ICE has contracted Palantir since 2011 for software it uses to enforce sanctions and make arrests, and in April signed a new $30 million contract with the company to, in The New York Times’s words, “build a platform to track migrant movements in real time.” Presumably the deal will help ICE’s director, Todd Lyons, realize a vision he laid out that same month at the Border Security Expo in Phoenix, where he said that he wants his agency to run like Amazon Prime, “but with human beings.” Advertisement These trends show no signs of stopping. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed the Department of Defense—now calling itself the Department of War—to increase its spending on software, which, he stresses, is “at the core of every weapon and supporting system we field to remain the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world.” Trump has signed executive orders designed to ease restrictions on defense exports and speed up and reduce oversight of the DoD’s acquisition process. In September the army announced a new venture-capital-style model for procurement called “Fuze.” Firms like Palantir and their new constellation of Silicon Valley funders stand to benefit handsomely from these developments. “We’re moving to a software-driven, autonomous…battlefield,” the managing director for a prominent private equity firm said at a defense summit earlier this year. “Well, if you want daily software upgrades, you gotta pay software margins.” * Few would contest that the political economy of American defense is troubled. Defense monopolies have stifled competition; companies have slowed their investment in production and concentrated instead on payouts to themselves and shareholders; costs and schedules have spun out of control. By now, as the scholar William Hartung has written, the federal government’s ballooning defense budget goes increasingly to “costly, dysfunctional weapons systems that are ill-suited to addressing current challenges.” Yet venture-funded defense-tech firms like Palantir and Anduril have positioned themselves as the solution to these ills without any clear evidence that they can deliver on that promise. The problem, put simply, is that they don’t have expertise in building things. Because they are above all instruments of financialization, designed to bring future values into the present, they tend to be better at generating short-term profits and juicing shareholder value than at creating durable, high-performing software or hardware systems. Anduril and other companies that offer “autonomous,” AI-enhanced hardware, for instance, have by now attracted criticism from a range of commentators: the evidence indicates that, despite their claims to the contrary, Silicon Valley drones and counterdrones have underperformed in Ukraine, where fighters have tended to prefer cheaper, hardier Chinese and homegrown drones instead. Adopting Palantir’s signature data-organizing software, too, could have significant problems for companies and government agencies in the long term. The software’s code is closed-source and privately hosted by Palantir, which retains the power—subject to the terms of its contracts and to the extent they prove enforceable—to change, update, or terminate it. Using it as the “data backbone” for a vast and complicated system makes it distinctly costly and burdensome to switch software in the future, not to mention to train and retrain its users. Meanwhile, as several critics have argued, the user loses a significant measure of control over the system itself. “The single fundamental problem with the Palantir contract is that the government is outsourcing all of the work to one company in one go,” a data expert told the New Statesman earlier this year, “and what you get is vendor lock-in. The state doesn’t understand the work, they can’t see the work…. You develop no knowledge, no understanding of it.” On the podcast Second Breakfast, the lawyer and former Army officer Eric Robinson related that, when he used Palantir’s software in the 2010s, “they would recode your data ingest so you couldn’t export it again,” with the result that “you had to pay for their tech to effectively be part of your order of battle…. It often seems like a form of long-term rent seeking.” In the telling of companies like Palantir and Anduril, their innovation, efficiency, and software expertise qualify them to jump-start a new era of American industrial policy. But not only do they seem ill-suited for such a task, they have publicly backed the Trump administration as it destroys the foundations of what industrial policy the country has. Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir, has, for instance, denounced “wokeness” for “corrupting and corroding our institutions,” echoing the rhetoric that Trump and other Republicans have used to attack measures like the CHIPS Act for including some redistributive initiatives and giving workers benefits like child care. We are now in a situation, in other words, where an array of right-wing firms and think tanks perversely extol the virtues of industrial policy and American renewal even as they support politicians and financial institutions that are currently dismantling the infrastructure to actually do industrial policy. Advertisement How did we get here? The answer lies, in part, in the fact that defense-related industries like the semiconductor sector have themselves long obscured their real relationship to industrial policy. It is a central tragedy of the long US century that military Keynesianism—the use of military spending to spur economic growth and enable spending on welfare and other public goods—has been the organizing principle for the country’s economy and social life since World War II. The defense budget—last year’s allocation was close to $900 billion—goes not just to weapons construction but also to a welfare state within a state: housing, health care, and social services. It funds a great deal of civilian industry, from wooden pallets to satellites and smartphones, not to mention research fundamental to the US economy and some degree of economic redistribution. Because of its sheer scale and reach, defense spending is unique in its ability to facilitate regional coalitions across party lines by directing funding to specific geographical targets: state-specific projects, bases, consortia, and so on. National Archives and Records Administration/Wikimedia Commons An armorer’s assistant installing a machine gun in a Lockheed P-38 plane at an aircraft plant in the Western US, circa November 1942 By forcing policymakers to appeal to “national security” (which since the 1980s has expanded to encompass “economic security”)1 to justify any efforts at industrial policy or social welfare, this system has long hobbled our ability to build a better world. But during the 1970s and 1980s, when a newly organized right wing took aim at state spending and capacity across the board, even the essential national-security fields of electronics and defense found their access to long-term government support under threat. To retain it, they arrived at a kind of truce. In public, these firms would happily chalk their success up to their own entrepreneurial genius. Under the radar, however, a range of policymakers and industry leaders worked to patch together a precarious, largely hidden system of government support that allowed the businesses—albeit in compromised form—to keep relying on federal planning, funding, and stewardship. Now the new Silicon Valley defense firms are taking advantage of this state of affairs to press their own interests. Rather than downplaying their reliance on the government in public while reaping the benefits of industrial policy in practice, though, they have done just the opposite, indulging in rhetoric about the return of the strong state and “reindustrialization” even as they help dismantle the state in the service of financial capital. Understanding the implications of this shift requires grasping the complexities of the relationship that tech and defense firms have long enjoyed with US state power. 2. In moments of “revolutionary crisis,” Karl Marx wrote, men “anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past to their service, borrowing from them names, battle slogans, and costumes in order to present this new scene in world history in time-honored disguise and borrowed language.” The defense-tech elite are no exception: they talk obsessively about the past, transmuting political-economic reality into a story of great-men-as-founders. Karp praises the Manhattan Project and welcomes comparisons to Oppenheimer. A Los Angeles Times piece from last year discovered that Palmer Luckey, the much-profiled founder of Anduril, has a preoccupation with purchasing cold war military relics: the red nuclear phone, “a couple of submarines,” at least one ICBM site. He hopes one day, the profile notes, to acquire “the entire US ground-based nuclear deterrent system…to turn it into a vast museum.” Their account of twentieth-century military-economic history is distinctly revisionist. In his appearance last year on The Merge, Sankar explained how to fix the defense-industrial base. “The reality is you focus on winning,” he said: I’m not a founder of Palantir, but I think about going back to that World War II–era period and the immediate cold war, it was founders. We think of it as Northrop Grumman and Martin Marietta, but it was Jack Northrop and Glenn Martin and Howard Hughes and Henry Kaiser, and even inside of government, the Kelly Johnsons, the John Boyds. These are uniquely hardheaded, creative, difficult people that are required to win. And I think every start-up understands that. That’s what a start-up looks like. The truth is dramatically different. The two world wars turned industrial power into US military dominance not because they empowered the genius of individuals but because they built a new and formidable state.2 Industrial and state capacity—not to mention the relationship between industry and government—were forever transformed. World War I inaugurated the use of cost-plus contracts, which stipulate that the government pay for all the costs of development and production plus a set profit. World War II offered the US a taste of a centralized planned economy: the war effort consumed 57 percent of the national income, and the government itself converted all the plants it needed to manufacture war material.3 In 1942, for instance, the War Production Board—which centralized control of investment and production—forced the whiskey industry to divert 60 percent of its production to industrial alcohol and modernized productive processes. It would not be an exaggeration to attribute the many new industries that emerged, modernized, or accelerated in the postwar years—aeronautics, vastly improved automobiles and motors, chemical and especially petrochemical firms, modern shipbuilding, electronics, atomic energy, logistics—to centralized government planning and funding. With government help, as Hartung notes in his study Prophets of War, the aviation industry’s production increased by 13,500 percent.4 New plants cropped up across the country, especially in the South and West, inaugurating the long-term industrialization of those regions. Cooperative large-scale applied research proliferated through the National Defense Research Committee, which commandeered both industry and academic resources and personnel. In his 1992 study of US industrial policy, the historian Otis Graham noted that the Defense Plant Corporation built “some 30 percent of the plant capacity on which American mobilization depended,” which was crucial to the postwar aircraft industry.5 Business leaders resisted their subjection to government administrators, and as soon as the war was over they sought to erase these years from public memory. But the fact remained that US defense contractors and technology firms owed their existence to extensive, heavy-handed government planning. * Government support, oversight, and coordination of important industries largely persisted throughout the cold war. In the immediate postwar period military contracts slowed, but the Korean War ensured another boom that lasted until the wind down of the Vietnam War two decades later. The Department of Defense “directed a large portion of the nation’s scientific and engineering resources throughout the postwar era,” Graham wrote, “frequently picking winning technologies and products by supplying the military’s clients—chiefly the weapons, aerospace, telecommunications, and data processing industries—with R&D support and purchasing of output.” The government covered nearly all basic research (which mostly occurs at government labs and universities), and much of the research and development conducted by private industry. Companies had plenty of money to invest and reinvest in production—and the DoD pressured them to do just that. Science History Institute An employee inspecting the control board for a solvent recovery system at the Hercules Powder Company plant in Hopewell, Virginia, 1940s As the scholar Christophe Lécuyer shows in his study Making Silicon Valley, all this investment made the US semiconductor industry possible.6 DoD contracts remade Fairchild, the industry’s pioneering firm, into a major company, and Fairchild in turn brought suppliers and equipment-makers to the Bay Area. The DoD not only funded the development of microelectronics but prioritized incorporating them into military systems; starting in 1963, Lécuyer notes, proposals had to include them for the projects to receive funding. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara’s initiatives before and especially during the Vietnam War transformed defense spending and the industrial policy associated with it. Much was made by General Westmoreland, starting in the late 1960s, of the promise that war would become an “electronic battlefield,” with armies taking advantage of all “the advanced technology of communications, sensors, fire direction, and the required automatic data processing” to control the fighting from afar.7 That this vision failed to materialize and cost the US dearly—in lives, reputation, and resources—doesn’t seem to have led anyone to rethink its premises. In the late 1960s disenchanted defense workers organized to shift industries such as chemicals and electronics away from war and toward the public good, or at least toward private consumption—an effort known as “civilianization.” At the same time, a civilian market for computer chips was exploding. Those initiatives, the planned Vietnam wind down, and détente with the USSR all helped shrink the federal government’s spending on defense in general and military R&D in particular. But it was a brief experiment that came with significant backlash, helping propel Reagan to the presidency and shaping his industrial policy. The federal share of research dollars remained high for much of the cold war, funding the development of lasers, nuclear energy, rockets, aerospace, computers, scientific instruments, data processing, and telecommunications while neglecting automobiles, steel, pharmaceuticals, and textiles—all of which moved offshore to a greater degree than they already had. 3. The first major political-economic changes after World War II came with the neoliberal turn of the 1980s and 1990s. During these years several crises descended upon a range of productive sectors that had historically relied on federal industrial policy. Internationally, Japan perfected production techniques in high-tech manufacturing—of cars, machine tools, memory chips, and other electronics—and quickly approached dominance in many areas considered central to “national security,” like semiconductors and supercomputing. American pundits at the time identified this trend as a direct threat to American-style capitalism and US power.8 The period’s neoliberal economic reforms—which reduced and limited the nature of government spending while demonizing the most basic forms of long-term planning—weakened productive industries still further, leaving manufacturers beholden to shareholder demands for ever more profits and vulnerable to new threats from financial institutions. These conditions posed a distinct threat to productive sectors like the semiconductor industry. And yet Intel, which by 1992 was leading the industry in cutting-edge chips, managed to thrive nonetheless. When reporters asked how they did it, the company’s executives pointed to what they called “Moore’s Law,” the idea, named after Intel cofounder Gordon Moore, that chips regularly became smaller and more powerful according to something like a natural principle. Moore’s Law became a fixture of the industry’s marketing presentations, press releases, and internal conferences.9 Over the years it helped convince defense leaders like Clinton’s secretary of defense, William Perry, and his protégée Ash Carter that technological solutions could eventually be found for their most pressing and difficult political problems. Moore’s Law remains an unquestioned assumption of scientific, military and national security state discourse and policy, undergirding the entire political-economic imagination of the post–cold war United States. Just as intellectuals started worrying that there might be fundamental limits to capitalist growth, it posited a horizon of infinite progress. The truth was more complicated. Intel, founded in 1968 by Moore and Robert Noyce, came to prominence by developing some of the first commercial metal-oxide semiconductor chips. Those semiconductors had immediate, tangible benefits, including low power consumption, high noise immunity, and cost efficiency. Working from that basis, the company did regularly improve its output with a kind of lawlike consistency in this era. But it wasn’t Moore’s Law that won the battle with the Japanese. Instead, Intel and others in the semiconductor industry built coalitions to carve out exceptions to many of the period’s neoliberal reforms, reaping the benefits of extraordinary state support. Among other things, the Reagan administration offered tax incentives to subsidize factory construction and investment in manufacturing, encouraged coordination and cartelization by offering antimonopoly relief and state planning, and used economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure to force concessions from Japan, such as giving foreign—which in effect meant US—chip manufacturers 20 percent of their market share and sharing significant manufacturing knowledge. Intel Free Press/Wikimedia Commons Andy Grove (left), the longtime head of Intel, sitting with the company’s founders, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, 1978 Under Reagan it was an open secret that the government’s treatment of the semiconductor industry, among others, amounted to a form of industrial policy. These measures had the backing of a powerful—if peculiar—bipartisan coalition that was preoccupied with sustaining American hegemony: national security and foreign policy hawks, factions in the business world, and a group of tech-friendly liberals, like Massachusetts senator Paul Tsongas and Tennessee senator Al Gore, who became known as the “Atari Democrats.” They were reacting to a new right that objected to industrial policy as such, on the grounds that any government planning and economic intervention smacked of communism: in late 1980 the first installment of the Heritage Foundation’s Mandate for Leadership—like its successor, Project 2025—called for destroying large swaths of government by loosening regulations and oversight, centralizing power in the executive, demolishing state capacity, and eliminating or significantly cutting funding for many programs and agencies. The new right lacked the political leverage to end industrial policy entirely. But between 1980 and 1993 they succeeded at making it politically toxic, forcing the industry and its allies to adjust their tactics. Bill Clinton, an Atari Democrat, took office hoping to build the US’s own version of Japan’s powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry; however hostile he was to labor, he implemented significant industrial policy for semiconductors immediately after his election. After Newt Gingrich’s Contract for America coalition swept Congress in 1994, however, the administration’s room for maneuver narrowed. It was still able to ensure some level of subsidies and planning for semiconductor firms like Intel. But it came to rely heavily on foreign policy measures—like sanctions, trade deals, diplomatic pressure, and throwing around US power to shape new international economic organizations like the World Trade Organization—to open new markets and ensure other benefits for tech companies. By the end of Clinton’s second term, a kind of tacit settlement had locked into place. Even as they continued to depend on these various forms of state support, semiconductor companies, tech entrepreneurs who relied on ever-improving semiconductors, and politicians on both sides of the aisle would insist they owed their success to the information-tech revolution, with its promise of infinite growth and cheap consumer goods, all predicated on the work of individual entrepreneurial geniuses. This rift between rhetoric and reality has only grown since. Today’s executives hardly seem to understand the conditions of their own industries; it is as if, on some level, they believe the flattering public narrative their predecessors spun. During his interview on The Merge, Sankar remarked that he and his peers are “children…of a Noycean culture.” In a sense this is not untrue. Intel’s Noyce and Sankar both downplay their industry’s debt to industrial policy; Palantir, not unlike Intel before it, is in part in the business of selling what Wired recently called “a seamless, almost magical solution to complex problems.” But Sankar clearly meant the analogy in a different sense: to lay claim to Noyce’s record of success, to brandish his legacy of American entrepreneurial technological genius, and to insist that Silicon Valley firms’ track record of such triumphs should entitle them to remake government in their own image. * The defense industry faced the same pressures that nearly destroyed US semiconductor firms at the dawn of the post–cold war era. In his last year in office Jimmy Carter reversed the cuts that had depressed the industry for much of the 1970s, and in his first term Reagan initiated an enormous military buildup. All this, Graham writes, strengthened the military’s claim on “the nation’s scientific and engineering resources, and thus its influence on industrial structure.” But other developments spelled trouble. By the early 1980s financial regulations were being loosened, and corporations were under increasing pressure—legal, managerial, and structural—to secure shareholder profits in the short term at the expense of long-term health. A low-margin productive industry like defense was badly suited to the era. By the mid-1980s firms were focusing on increasing their financial performance by using stock buybacks and cost-reduction strategies like just-in-time inventory management—ordering only enough resources to cover immediate needs. All this compromised their ability to respond flexibly to crises and to make high-quality products. In 1985 the Reagan administration started reducing defense spending again and limited other avenues for profit. Facing increased political scrutiny, Reagan officials had recently made a big show of auditing firms for the appearance of wasteful spending, introducing policies that tightened defense profits and increased accounting paperwork. Many companies, like GE, curtailed their defense wings or left the sector entirely to boost their stock values for an increasingly defense-skeptical Wall Street. The 1980s also saw the rise of corporate raiders, later known as private equity firms, which would acquire a majority share of a company’s stock, take control of its operations, and then “restructure” it, which usually meant stripping it for parts and paying themselves astronomical sums of money. Between 1982 and 1990 such outfits nearly destroyed several defense firms, including Martin Marietta and Lockheed, and left them weakened with large debt-to-equity ratios. With loosened financial rules and low margins came consolidation: between 1985 and 1988 ten of the top sixty defense firms acquired or were acquired by others. Perhaps no person’s career tracks how the defense industry navigated these changes more clearly than that of Norm Augustine. Born in 1935, Augustine got his start in defense at the Douglas Aircraft Company in 1958. His first foray into government came in 1965 as one of McNamara’s young hires, brought in from the private sector to cut waste using “economic efficiency” measures like cost-benefit analysis. He then ping-ponged between the public and private defense sectors: after serving as the under secretary of the Army he joined Martin Marietta, then one of the country’s largest defense firms. Between 1980 and 1982, meanwhile, he chaired the Defense Science Board, authoring reports on threats to the defense industrial base and its dependence on the troubled semiconductor sector. Rising in the ranks of Martin Marietta over the 1980s, Augustine saw that defense was in turmoil; he later referred to the decade as the industry’s “dark ages.” Denver Post/Getty Images Martin Marietta CEO Thomas G. Pownall (center) and Norman Augustine (right) talking with a shareholder, 1983 The fall of the USSR and Clinton’s electoral victory brought a new existential threat. Federal defense funding plummeted: between 1989 and 1997 procurement declined by 60 percent. The result was something like the industry’s Great Depression; in 1995 Augustine told a House committee that an estimated three quarters of the sector, about 90,000 firms, had evaporated in the span of a decade. As defense programs became fewer and more expensive, the remaining firms started making riskier bids, overpromising on cost, time, and quality. In 1993 Clinton’s defense secretary, Les Aspin, invited the CEOs of major defense firms to the Pentagon for a dinner that would become known as the “last supper.” The then-deputy defense secretary, William Perry, showed them a slideshow of necessary defense capacity: “We expect defense companies to go out of business,” he told them. When we talked in a recent interview, Augustine told me he feared the administration would nationalize at least significant parts of the industry. They were faced with either entering new markets, consolidating, or downsizing. In the five years that followed, Augustine consolidated many firms under Lockheed Martin, itself the product of the merger of Lockeed and Martin Marietta, forming the country’s largest defense firm. In 1995 the new company went public, at which point it started prioritizing stock prices and other contemporary markers of financial health. It worked: in 1997 Augustine wrote that the company’s share price had nearly doubled in two years. And yet in the process Lockheed Martin closed a quarter of its plants and laid off 100,000 workers, vastly paring down management and labor in the name of efficiency. The benefits of all this cost-cutting rarely went to the government. Nor were many of the gains reinvested in production. Lockheed Martin had become good at getting contracts; Augustine wrote in the Harvard Business Review about harnessing the “natural competitive instincts in human beings.” But the products themselves suffered: they were more expensive, slower to deliver, and of lower quality. * The state’s priorities were also changing. The Gulf War seemed to vindicate Westmoreland’s Vietnam-era dreams of an “electronic battlefield.” William Perry, soon elevated to defense secretary, became a firm believer that the US was on the cusp of a “revolution in military affairs”—the idea, as the RAND analyst Paul K. Davis has summarized it, that “technological developments sometimes make possible a qualitative change in the nature of warfare.” That conviction moved him to prioritize funding, developing, and promoting “dual-use” technologies that could be applied to both commercial and military settings. He and Clinton built closer relationships with technology firms, offering them greater access to government and policymaking.10 In the late 1990s, as the researcher Barry D. Watts notes in a 2008 report, the Pentagon encouraged defense companies to “act more like commercial firms.” Augustine was well-positioned to adapt to these conditions. He had advocated for government support for the semiconductor industry during its crisis: asking “why DoD or the government should provide support for the semiconductor industry,” he testified to the Senate in 1987, “would be much like asking at the outset of World War II why we should buy ships and airplanes because it might help the shipbuilding and the aircraft industries.” From his perch on initiatives like the Defense Science Board, he not only observed but shaped how Intel and others had navigated the changing political-economic waters; now he hoped to replicate their accomplishments. Between 1993 and 1998, as Hartung has shown, Augustine lobbied intensely—and successfully—for immense government subsidies for defense in general and the new Lockheed Martin in particular. Those subsidies came in many forms, from aid for mergers—“closing plants, relocating equipment, paying severance to laid-off workers, and providing ‘golden parachutes’ to board members and executives,” as Hartung puts it—to antitrust exemptions and subsidies for arms exports (especially to new NATO countries). “To say that Augustine is wired into the Washington policy-making process is an understatement,” Hartung noted in 1996. “For most of his career, he has been one of a handful of people drawing up the blueprints for American defense policies and deciding where the wiring should be placed.” In the 1990s companies like Intel experimented with setting up their own venture capital arms, government-backed consortia, and new institutions whose purpose was to plan and shape the markets around them. Augustine followed their lead: he and other defense industry leaders managed to insulate themselves both from democratic accountability and from the vagaries of anti-statist politics by creating experimental public institutions. In 1998 George Tenet’s CIA enlisted Augustine to help found a nonprofit venture capital firm called In-Q-Tel that gives start-ups long-term guidance and directs them to lucrative, stable government contracts. Unlike traditional VCs, In-Q-Tel claims to focus more on technology and less on profits, though over the years it seems to have helped these new companies make money more than it has helped the government acquire important technology. It was In-Q-Tel that assured the success of, among others, Palantir, Anduril, and the drone company Skydio. Augustine, who turned ninety this July, hardly ever uses words like “industrial policy” or “neoliberalism,” but in practice he and his peers became influential critics of the neoliberal turn. He has argued that, in the financialized economy, “the tax structure discourages long-term investments” and lamented that shareholders hoping for short-range profit want Lockheed Martin not to “invest in research.” Elsewhere, he has called for renewed federal funding for public education and criticized US companies for moving “much of their manufacturing capability abroad.” In an influential 2005 report called Rising Above the Gathering Storm, he and his colleagues argued that “the prosperity the United States enjoys today is due in no small part to investments the nation has made in research and development at universities, corporations, and national laboratories over the last fifty years.” The “pressures” on that sector, they warned, “could seriously erode this past success.” In such moments, Augustine sounds uncannily both like architects of Bidenomics such as Jake Sullivan and Jennifer Harris and like right-wing tech-defense figures such as Sankar, who has similarly criticized “the financialization of the defense industrial base.” There is a certain irony here: by founding In-Q-Tel and seeding a bipartisan consensus around what plagued America’s political economy, Augustine—perhaps inadvertently—helped create the coalition now hoping to displace the company he has spent much of his life running. 4. Defense stocks tanked in 1998 and 1999, and credit agencies downgraded their debt to nearly “uninvestable” levels. As the industry consolidated, firms got even bigger, more complex, and, via joint contracts, increasingly linked to one another. By 2000 they were in a delicate position. With relatively low profits and cash flow but high debt-to-equity ratios, they increasingly focused less on investing in essential R&D than on trying to grow in the short term by competing recklessly for contracts. Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division A pilot operating the instrument panel of the Lockheed Martin C-130J-30 Hercules cargo plane during a demonstration flight for Pentagon personnel and press over Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, 1998 Then came the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which, as Hartung has shown in Prophets of War, inaugurated an industry-wide bonanza. Companies like Lockheed Martin entered new markets: “enhanced interrogation,” translation, dubiously legal surveillance. The Bush administration was full of defense monopoly affiliates, among them Secretary of the Air Force James Roche, a former vice president at Northrop Grumman; Secretary of the Navy Gordon England, a former executive at General Dynamics; and Edward Aldridge, who was a member of Lockheed Martin’s board of directors while serving on the president’s commission on space. Congress subsidized Lockheed Martin for arming new Eastern European NATO members; in 2008 US companies accounted for two thirds of the world’s new arms sales. At the same time, the DoD came to focus on counterinsurgency and counterterrorism techniques that relied heavily on information technology, like cyberwar and “network-centric warfare.” Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld wanted to make “the leap into the information age” by pursuing drones and surveillance. None of this meant that the trend toward military privatization slowed. It continued apace through the Iraq War, from the US military’s contracts with mercenaries like Blackwater to private contracts for hardware. On Second Breakfast, the former Green Beret Justin McIntosh describes how outsourcing military functions to contractors during the Syrian conflict forced him into a situation not unlike The Wages of Fear: I had a truck that had a bent rod. These trucks that we’re driving around in, these MRAPs and these large RG-33s…[require] a contractor [to] come in and work on it. We were in an area where we had been shot at. I had to medically evacuate some guys. The contractors did not want to travel. They wanted me to drive this truck hundreds of kilometers to the safe base where they could then repair it. The problem, McIntosh continued, was that “we had already taken all of that capability that existed within the United States military”—for instance, the ability to repair its own equipment—and “shifted it over to the private sector. It gave them control.” * This tendency toward privatization continued through the Obama administration, during which defense officials started to fixate on reducing costs. (“The gusher has been turned off,” Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced in 2010.) Obama saw bloated defense monopolies as an obstacle to this goal. But rather than addressing the structure of the industry or its political economy, the administration focused on improving its topline numbers by switching out the supposedly corrupt, atrophied defense giants for new firms from the Democrat-friendly tech sector, which promised to replace the functions of the legacy firms more cheaply. An influential proponent of this turn was Ash Carter, whom Obama nominated as his defense secretary in 2014. Carter and his deputy, Robert Work, had a “simple but ambitious” agenda, as the anthropologist Roberto González has written: “to harness the best and brightest ideas from the tech industry for Pentagon use.”11 Carter’s emphasis would be not on training soldiers but on developing drones, automation, satellites, and other cutting-edge defense technologies sourced from Silicon Valley. Carter’s focus on unmanned tech was not exactly a break from the Bush era, but the shift to the Valley was. Fueled by experiments like In-Q-Tel, the tech-defense coalition was already looking to gain market share: in 2014, nearly a year before Carter took office, SpaceX sued the Air Force for preferring the primes; in 2016 Palantir filed a lawsuit against the Army for allegedly trying to develop internal intelligence software without adequately considering commercial options. (One of Anduril’s founders, Trae Stephens, has claimed that these lawsuits helped Anduril win defense department contracts.)12 Obama and then Trump both also expanded the department’s ability to use its “other transaction authority,” which allows the government to do business more easily with commercial entities, for example by letting it sign contracts faster and with less oversight. The defense start-ups that successfully attracted Silicon Valley financing relied on the extraordinary wealth and political lobbying connections of their founders. “Every defense company that had been founded by a billionaire was a success,” as Luckey—who sold his VR company, Oculus, to Facebook in 2014 for $2 billion—noted in 2024. “I hate that we live in a country where that’s the case,” he added. “But I realized that I had a unique responsibility as one of the very few people who was willing to work on national security and blessed with the resources to actually make a real go at it.” Obama officials proved receptive to such lobbying. During his tenure Carter set up an In-Q-Tel-inspired program called Defense Innovation Unit—Experimental (DIUx), which worked closely with a new Defense Innovation Board, chaired by the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, to determine the government’s investments in emerging technology, from drones to AI. It encouraged Silicon Valley firms and funders with the promise of long-term contracts for defense tech, as well as evaluation and testing—in effect ensuring their success in advance. Carter also laid the foundations for projects that came to fruition under the first Trump administration: between 2017 and 2019 the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy all launched their own experimental institutions designed to set up tech start-ups with military contracts. Private equity and venture capital saw an opportunity to make nearly guaranteed profits off the government’s investments. Between 2021 and 2024, VCs poured $130 billion into defense. In their book Unit X (2024), two of DIUx’s early directors, Raj M. Shah and Christopher Kirchhoff, claim that by 2017 their work had excited “investors and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley” about working with the Pentagon by lowering “barriers to entry.” (They decline to specify which ones.) When James Mattis visited DIUx under the first Trump administration, in 2017, Shah and Kirchhoff arranged for him to have dinner with the tech investor Sam Altman (then at Y-Combinator) and the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who insisted that the Valley was interested in the defense industry and implored him to support the project. Mattis was enticed by the work they were doing on drones—a later fixation of Andreessen’s. Employees at Google expressed discontent with the company’s defense contracts, organizing to block initiatives like Project Maven, a machine learning program for the Pentagon. The project was hardly promising: as Alexander Cockburn wrote last year in Harper’s, an Air Force testing unit found in 2011 that, “among numerous other deficiencies,” the drone-mounted cameras on which it relied “could not ‘readily find and identify targets,’ and its transmission rate was too slow.” But DoD funders were eager to collaborate with Silicon Valley all the same. (According to Cockburn, Amazon, Microsoft, and Palantir were among the subcontractors who joined the Maven project after Google declined to renew the contract in 2018.) Since then employers have used the threat of AI to shrink the pool of tech jobs, costing the workers leverage. By 2022 employee dissent had been largely squashed: Google and other major defense firms all but declared that they were happy to work with the military. Now executives at tech and tech-defense firms brag about joining the army reserves to help with the design and purchase of their products—an arrangement that seems rife with potential conflicts of interest. The Biden administration continued many of these Obama-Trump trends. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin appointed Apple’s Doug Beck to direct DIU—as it was by now simply called—and empowered him to report directly to Austin. Congress gave the program nearly $1 billion for the 2024 financial year, and Biden awarded important hardware contracts to Palantir and Anduril. SpaceX doubled its federal contracts at the beginning of the Biden administration; they had practically doubled again by the end. In late 2022 Austin established the Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) to push investment in defense-oriented small businesses and tech start-ups; under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, it will have $200 billion to spend, and likely more in the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act. Perhaps most visibly, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks enthusiastically embraced all things tech: at a 2024 event organized by Andreessen’s VC firm, she emphasized that “moving fast and breaking things is necessary to win wars.” Nonetheless DIU’s leaders and their Silicon Valley allies felt that the Biden Department of Defense wasn’t friendly enough. By 2023, Shah and Kirchhoff complain, it still awarded most of its contracts to the primes. “It seemed as if the whole Biden team had forgotten about DIU and Silicon Valley,” they write, “even as Ukraine was aggressively deploying DIU technologies on the battlefield.” Their vision for the department is blunt: “All the Pentagon needs to do is be a great customer. Buy products, and trust that good venture capitalists will pour money into the companies building those products.” * All this support for the tech-defense sector has so far had disappointing results. A congressionally mandated report produced this year by the Government Accountability Office suggests that there were no metrics by which DIU could measure its success at actually bringing new technology into the military. The Biden defense department’s embrace of tech yielded such fruits as the “Replicator Initiative,” which committed in August 2023 to delivering “multiple thousands” of new autonomous systems in eighteen to twenty-four months. Hartung told me that many industry experts found that timeline hard to believe: no program had ever delivered products that fast. The deadline the initiative set has now passed, and his skepticism seems warranted. The initial delivery was said to be in the hundreds, and The Wall Street Journal recently reported that some of the program’s systems “have been unreliable, or were so expensive or slow to be manufactured they couldn’t be bought in the quantity needed.”For many observers, the first real test of Silicon Valley defense tech is how US-made drone technology fares in Ukraine, a war often cited as a laboratory for unmanned warfare. In a speech this past August, published in the Free Press, Luckey described going to the front lines “just a few weeks” after the full-scale Russian invasion “to train Ukrainian soldiers on advanced military technology that I had developed.” He witnessed “remarkable” feats, he said: “with drones costing just a few thousand dollars each, a handful of Ukrainian pilots remotely carpeted airstrips with explosives thousands of miles into Russia.” (He seems to have been playing fast and loose with chronology: Ukrainian drones reached hundreds of miles into Russian territory that December; it would take them still longer to reach thousands.) Drone technology has indeed been crucial to the conflict, especially more recently, as troops have been harder to come by on both sides. But a range of commentators have cautioned against assuming it therefore represents “the future of war.” Prominent defense think tanks like RUSI have warned that “overreliance on uncrewed aerial systems” has created “significant problems” for Ukraine, in part because it “plays into Russia’s strengths” at short-range air defense and other antidrone capabilities. William LaPlante, Biden’s under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, has echoed this view. “Don’t tell me it’s got AI and quantum in it. I don’t care,” he said at a 2022 conference. “The tech bros aren’t helping us too much in Ukraine…. It’s hardcore production of really serious weaponry. That’s what matters.” (Many drone companies, moreover, still rely on Chinese parts.) The subtext behind the flurry of puff pieces treating drone war as an inevitability is that a trough of money in the small-to-midsize drone market is up for grabs, over which various coalitions are starting to compete. Sean Gallup/Getty Images A soldier in a US Army platoon specializing in unmanned aircraft systems watches an Anduril Ghost-X drone landing during an exercise at the Hohenfels Training Area, Bavaria, February 3, 2025 To the extent that drones have proven essential in Ukraine, for that matter, hardware made in the US—by firms like Microsoft, Skydio, AeroVironment, and Cyberlux—has fallen short of expectations. Ukrainians have found US-produced drones “fragile and unable to overcome Russian jamming and GPS blackout technology,” The Wall Street Journal reported last year. “At times, they couldn’t take off, complete missions or return home.” Skydio recently announced that one of its controllers was vulnerable to radio interference. The trend of connecting more devices together to create an “Internet of things” often creates new vulnerabilities in turn. Anduril’s output is no exception. The defense blogger who writes under the name Secretary of Defense Rock observed in one widely shared piece that the company’s products “often amount to little more than rebranding existing technologies with a Silicon Valley gloss.” One of their much-touted anti-drone interceptors, the essay suggests, has “the same core function” as a familiar Raytheon product, “with marginal enhancements, repackaged in a sleeker design and infused with branding language that flatters venture capital expectations more than it reflects operational novelty.” Anduril continues to contend both with high costs and with certain problems in the field: “During an exercise last year in the Pacific called Project Kahuna,” according to the Journal, “drones from different manufacturers connected by Anduril’s software struggled at times to coordinate and perform tasks when out of sight from the operator.” Last month, Reuters has reported, the Army’s chief technology officer circulated a memo identifying a “very high risk” factor in Anduril’s prototype for a “next generation command and control” battlefield communications network: “We cannot control who sees what, we cannot see what users are doing, and we cannot verify that the software itself is secure.” None of this should be surprising. Anduril is making moves to scale up production, claiming that it plans to open a “hyperscale manufacturing facility” in Ohio next year—but VC–funded firms don’t usually have the incentives or structure to prioritize taking on high-risk hardware projects. Often such companies focus instead on acquiring other firms in areas they’d like to enter, whose “founders” and engineers tend to quickly depart. They often make cuts for “efficiency” that produce an attractive financial picture in the short term, but damage the company in the long run. “The primary product of the defense VC strategy,” the scholar Elke Schwarz has written in a recent article, “is not a defense technology as such, but financial returns achieved through growth.” Worse still, she notes, venture capital’s “mandate for hypergrowth” means that VC-funded companies feel even more pressure than regular ones to produce exponential profits; when those companies make defense products, investors stand to reap enormous windfalls if armed conflict escalates around the world. “To get the military-industrial sector to grow fast,” Schwarz writes, “perhaps the best catalyst is war, or at least the embrace of its possibility.” Indeed, in 2023 a representative of America’s Frontier Fund, a VC firm backed by Thiel and Schmidt, told investors that if “the China/Taiwan situation happens,” or more generally “if there is a kinetic event in the Pacific,” then the fund’s investments would go up ten times “overnight.” 5. Resisting the defense-tech sector’s great man theory of history has grown all the more urgent now, as the Trump administration seems intent on placing those “great men” at the helm of the national security state and entrusting them with reindustrializing the sectors attached to it. Michael Obadal, the former Anduril senior director who is now Army under secretary, is part of a large cohort of Silicon Valley–adjacent figures in the administration: Dan Driscoll, a onetime J.D. Vance adviser with a background in private equity and venture capital, was confirmed as Army secretary13; Steve Feinberg, founder of the notorious private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, which in recent years has invested heavily in defense tech, is in as deputy secretary at the Department of Defense, where he is using his experience to “restructure” the Pentagon; the retired general and venture capitalist Dan Kaine is now chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Office of Science and Technology Policy is now headed by Peter Thiel’s former chief of staff; and the assistant secretary of defense for critical technologies is now Michael Dodd, also known as “the Doddfather,” an alumnus of DIU. At least until the administration’s recent announcement that it is seeking an equity stake in Lockheed Martin, the primes appeared mostly sanguine about their aspiring competitors. Congress—which tech-defense firms spend millions lobbying14—writes the yearly defense budget, and primes have historically wielded considerable power there; they still receive the bulk of defense spending. Among the legacy firms the prevailing consensus has been that the upstarts will not be able to replace them: their products, after all, are already battle tested. Even so, the defense-tech contracts are pouring in. The Golden Dome missile defense program—a $175 billion-plus redux of Israel’s Iron Dome and Reagan’s Star Wars missile defense program, which experts call just as unfeasible as it was in the Eighties—seems to be shaping up as a cash giveaway to the tech-defense right; a joint bid from SpaceX, Anduril, and Palantir is reportedly the front-runner for the contract. (Hegseth has ordered major cuts at the Pentagon testing and evaluation office that a congressional panel recently tasked with assessing the program.) Other start-ups hope to privatize hardware testing, and Palantir seems to be positioning itself to assume some of the same functions of the embattled National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. New Pentagon rules that facilitate “anything-as-a-service” contracting allow private companies to shut off or modify their products as they desire (within contractual constraints, assuming these are followed), making US arms exports considerably less appealing to other countries but allowing the companies veto power over the use of their services or weapons—and further opportunities for rent-seeking. This past May, Luckey announced that Anduril would, as 60 Minutes put it, surpass “$6 billion in government contracts worldwide” by the end of the year. “We buy a lot of things from Palantir,” Trump said at a recent White House AI summit, calling out Sankar by name. Scott Legato for Palantir Technologies/Getty Images Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar giving a keynote speech at the Inaugural Reindustrialize Conference in front of a projection of Intel cofounder Robert Noyce, Detroit, Michigan, June 26, 2024 Defense-tech executives clearly hope to take advantage of the post-Covid surge of interest in industrial policy. There has been a great deal of chatter in right-wing circles, from Oren Cass’s American Compass to the Heritage Foundation, about the prospect that the US could move from a supposedly feminized service-based economy to a masculine-coded, producerist one organized around defense manufacturing. (In April, Fox News ran the chyron “TRUMP’S MANLY TARIFFS: PUNDIT BELIEVES IT COULD REVERSE CRISIS IN MASCULINITY.”) Even institutions like the American Enterprise Institute, which have historically reviled industrial policy in any form, have jumped on board, publishing papers endorsing industrial policies of different kinds tied to “national security.” Palantir’s leaders have echoed this rhetoric for their own purposes: Sankar lamented on The Merge that the best minds have gone into fields like ad-tech rather than defense engineering; Karp has declared that US industry has degenerated in the past fifty years to focus on “the consumer market” rather than using technology to “address challenges of industrial and national significance.” Trump himself seems to alternately contradict and endorse this agenda. He has been especially critical of CHIPS, accusing it of offering companies money they didn’t need and requiring them to hire “woke people” that hampered their success; at a recent AI summit he encouraged “all American companies to join us in rejecting poisonous Marxism in our technology.” It is as if he thinks that chip manufacturing can be brought back to the US through permitting reform and tariffs alone. Appalling immigration raids like the recent one on a Hyundai factory in Georgia have conflicted with the administration’s aim to learn from foreign expertise, producing extreme international backlash. Most recently, under Feinberg’s aegis at the DoD, the administration has pioneered an entirely new form of statecraft: running the Pentagon like a private equity firm. In the past two months the government has made a slew of one-off deals with companies like NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and a rare earth mineral company called MP Materials. At the center of some of these agreements is a novel reading of the Defense Production Act, which the Senate Armed Services Committee is trying to formalize via a new provision allowing the government to make equity purchases in private firms. The provision has yet to pass—which has not stopped the administration from going ahead anyway. The MP Materials agreement is instructive. Feinberg, no stranger to investing in the defense world, reportedly negotiated the deal, which includes a provision to buy magnets from the company despite the fact that they only started manufacturing magnets last year. By offering a price floor and production guarantees, the Department of Defense made it possible for Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan to finance the issuance of equity in the firm—at which point, seemingly for the first time in US history, the DoD itself bought enough equity to become the company’s largest single shareholder and provided a $150 million loan for the company’s California mine.15 Each of these deals works a bit differently. CHIPS had promised Intel $11 billion on the condition that it met certain milestones, including building an arguably unnecessary Ohio megafactory; when the firm appeared unlikely to meet those conditions, the Trump administration exchanged the remaining money for roughly 10 percent equity in the company. With AMD and NVIDIA, the mechanism looked more like a straightforward shakedown: Trump announced that if NVIDIA wants to continue selling AI chips to China, it has to fork over 15 percent of the profits. These moves hardly amount to a real industrial strategy. One-off coercive deals with individual companies already seem unlikely to reindustrialize the country, and it remains unclear what the administration will do with its new assets. But that outcome seems even less plausible as the Trump administration takes a sledgehammer to the government’s capacity, oversight, and industrial policy. In a mere nine months the administration has destroyed the infrastructure of research and development on which the semiconductor industry and many others rely; done its best to “get rid of” the “horrible, horrible” CHIPS Act, including the new research infrastructure it created; threatened to arbitrarily revoke awards and enacted swiftly changing tariffs that damage industries; behaved so erratically toward the US’s longtime allies that the EU and others have started looking elsewhere to buy weapons; erased the nonpartisan image on which the military depends for its continued funding and ability to operate; decimated the Pentagon’s civilian staff; devastated green industries while simultaneously promising to drive the price of oil so far down that the industry believes it will cause significant bankruptcies; and curtailed the Department of Defense’s product testing, among much else. None of the defense-tech firms that praise industrial policy in theory have launched any serious public protest against these decisions. The more contracts they get, meanwhile, the more government resources they will siphon away from investing in fields—like climate technologies, welfare, or alternatives to plastics—that would benefit the US’s economy or security. Bigger tech companies such as Meta, Amazon, and Google have, for their part, also moved much closer to the Trump administration. They seem indifferent about the destruction of the infrastructures of research and support upon which they previously relied, perhaps because they believe they can hire researchers on a mercenary basis, outsource research and development to AI, or replace government functions with private ones—a doubtful prospect, since the government’s function as a neutral evaluator and standard-setter seems impossible to replace.16 The practical problem with this vision, to say nothing of its moral and ethical failings, is that it can only deal with the short term. “We love disruption,” Karp said during the company’s quarterly earnings call in February. “Disruption, at the end of the day, exposes things that aren’t working. There will be ups and downs. There’s a revolution. Some people are going to get their heads cut off. We’re expecting to see really unexpected things and to win.” Tech companies and venture-capital firms have become experts at leveraging this sort of “disruption” to generate value for their shareholders on the basis of imagined future profits, and firms like Palantir and Anduril are no exception. But now they have become so voracious, so all-consuming, that they are putting the country’s productive industries at risk. In the process, they threaten to destroy not just the source of their own profits but the spending and investment that lie at the foundation of the US economy.

Title: Is JioBlackRock Flexi Cap worth a bite?

The scheme comes after a set of passive launches earlier in the year. With this fund, the asset manager enters the well-established flexi-cap category which already has 40+ options and manages nearly ₹5 lakh crore in assets. JioBlackRock fund’s distinct proposition is that it will be managed using a rules-based, technology-led approach rather than a purely discretionary style. At the core of the design is BlackRock’s Systematic Active Equity (SAE) framework. It combines human expertise with data-driven models and draws from a wide universe of about 750 Indian stocks, narrowed down from more than 1,000 using liquidity, turnover, and execution feasibility filters. Each stock is scored on the basis of signals (over 400 of them specific to India) covering fundamentals, market behaviour, and alternative data. The models appear to be refreshed weekly. A benchmark-aware risk process is meant to keep deviations controlled vis-a-vis Nifty 500 Total Return Index whose current top holdings include HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, RIL, Infosys, Bharti Airtel, L&T, ITC, TCS and SBI. The fund’s aim will be to deliver consistent long-term alpha while managing volatility. For perspective, flexi-cap funds as a category have a three-year monthly standard deviation of 3.7 per cent and a Sortino ratio of 0.25, according to ACEMF. The technology backbone is BlackRock’s Aladdin platform, which is widely used by global institutions for portfolio risk analytics, transaction cost modelling, and compliance. In principle, this could provide the fund managers with an advantage in managing costs and risks at scale. Another selling point is that a systematic approach can reduce behavioural biases that affect human decision-making, such as overconfidence or recency. On the investor-facing side, JioBlackRock Flexi Cap Fund has several interesting features. It has no exit load, unlike many equity funds that impose a fee for exits within a year (0.10-1 per cent). The indicative total expense ratio for the direct plan is 0.5 per cent, placing it in the 1st quartile (lowest cost group) basis direct plan offerings. Fund managers Tanvi Kacheria and Sahil Chaudhary bring experience in quantitative and index portfolio management. India’s equity market has expanded significantly in recent years, with higher trading volumes, broader sector representation, and more IPOs adding to the listed universe. A larger opportunity set makes systematic strategies easier to apply. That said, the gaps are clear. As an NFO, there is no live performance record. The back-tested numbers shown in the presentation are hypothetical and cannot substitute for real-world data. Investors should also be aware that regular rebalancing, while intended to capture opportunities quickly, could increase churn and costs if not managed tightly. Flexi-cap funds are designed to provide long-term growth by giving managers the freedom to invest across large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks without restriction. They can suit investors who want equity exposure but prefer to leave the market-cap allocation decisions to professionals. The flexi-cap space already has proven schemes with long track records. On average, existing actively managed funds in the category have delivered about 16.9 per cent CAGR over three years and 20.9 per cent over five years, broadly in line with the Nifty 500 TRI’s returns of 16.9 per cent and 20.8 per cent over the same periods. Fund portfolios are typically tilted towards large-caps (57 per cent), with decent allocations to mid-caps (20 per cent) and small-caps (17 per cent). Investors will need to weigh whether an untested quant-driven offering is worth adding alongside established names. Overall, JioBlackRock Flexi Cap Fund represents an ambitious attempt to bring systematic active investing into India’s retail mutual fund space. Its differentiators are breadth of stock coverage, use of alternative data and AI, governance filters, and lower cost. The risks are the lack of a live record and dependence on models that may behave differently in stressed conditions. Also, small bets across a large number of stocks to beat Nifty 500 may result in a very diffused portfolio. For investors seeking core flexi-cap exposure, established funds remain more reliable choices. JioBlackRock Flexi Cap may be tracked as an option for satellite allocation once it builds a live record. bl.portfolio Star Track Mutual Fund Ratings’ current preferred choices include HDFC Flexi Cap Fund, Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund, and Franklin India Flexi Cap Fund.

Title: As stock market booms, Americans have more at stake than ever
URL: https://www.inquirer.com/business/stock-market-economy-investors-ai-wall-street-20251004.html
Time Published: 2025-10-04T09:13:40Z
Full Content:
Small investors are riding a wave, even as Wall Street’s gains overlay a mixed economic picture and some analysts think the market is overheated. Americans have a greater share of their resources in the stock market than ever before, driving a historic accumulation of wealth that also leaves more individual investors exposed to the market’s ups and downs. That expansion comes as stocks march steadily upward in defiance of increasingly worrisome economic data. The S&P 500 index rose about 7% in the third quarter that ended Tuesday, led by artificial-intelligence-related investments that some believe are primed for a correction. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis showed that households and nonprofits were investing about 45.4% of their assets in corporate equities as of the second quarter of 2025 — the highest exposure to stocks ever. An estimated 62% of Americans own stock as of May, matching 2024 and the highest level since 2007, according to the polling firm Gallup. And Federal Reserve data analyzed by the Securities and Exchange Commission shows the median U.S. household had about $52,000 in stock holdings as of 2022, compared with nearly $46,000 in 2019. Analysts say there are myriad reasons for this trend line; trading apps such as Robinhood and Webull have made it easier to invest small amounts of money in companies and index funds. It also explains the rise in meme stocks — shares of a company that go viral by way of social media sites such as Reddit. The expansion of 401(k) accounts, spurred by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, means more workers are automatically enrolled in retirement plans that include stocks and bonds. The stock surge has created an influx of millionaires, according to Fidelity Investments, one of the largest administrators of workplace retirement plans. Fidelity had 595,000 accounts with balances in excess of $1 million at the end of the second quarter, up nearly 20% year over year. Personal finance experts also point to the role of emotions in setting investment trends. The spectacular stock market gains of 2020 and 2021 have also led to a sense of FOMO — fear of missing out — as people want to position themselves for the next rally, said Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar. “We’ve also enjoyed a fairly strong economy for a decade-plus, and economic expansion tends to give households more leeway in their budgets to invest for the long term, and more confidence to do so,” Benz said. Meanwhile, Wall Street looked past the looming government shutdown on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 closing out the last day of the third quarter with a 0.4% gain; the index is now up 13.7% for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed more than 9% since the start of 2025, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has soared 17.3%. And the Russell 2000 index of small-cap companies is up 9.3% for the year. The third quarter has historically been “the most challenging quarter of the year,” notes CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall, who closely tracks the stock market’s historic performance. October, by comparison, has been associated with a number of volatile “shakeout events,” Stovall said, possibly because it coincides with the end of the fiscal year for many mutual funds, meaning fund managers often adjust their portfolios. Historically, “there is more rain in September, but more wind in October,” Stovall said. Wall Street’s gains overlay a mixed economic picture. Inflation ticked up to 2.9% in August to the fastest pace since January, fueling stagflation worries. Though unemployment remains relatively low, at 4.3%, U.S. employers created far fewer positions during much of 2024 and the early part of 2025 than previously reported, according to recent federal data. Analysts say the most recent market gains got a nudge from the Federal Reserve, which lowered its benchmark rate by a quarter-point on Sept. 17, citing a cooling labor market. That should mean lower borrowing costs for Americans looking to buy homes or wanting to start or grow businesses. Falling rates could help companies reduce debt or invest more in their operations. But any development that affects the Fed’s plans — such as an unexpectedly high inflation reading or new tariffs — could spook the markets, said Michael Farr, an analyst with the D.C.-based Farr, Miller & Washington. “What happens if tariff inflation shows up and the Fed says, ‘Wait a minute’? We’re already moving into the thin branches of risk, solely based on these price levels,” Farr said. As a result, Farr said, investing in 2025 is “anything but a no-brainer,” because buying into the stock market means paying for stocks at near-record prices. “Stock ownership means that you own a small piece of corporate America,” Farr said. “While you never want to bet against corporate America, you never want to pay the highest price anyone has ever paid.” The market has been buoyed by continued enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, with big tech companies including Oracle, Palantir, and Meta driving a significant share of the market’s gains. Investors could be at risk if the new technology fails to deliver returns that are commensurate with the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on data centers, energy, and other aspects of AI infrastructure. And some analysts believe AI stocks are overvalued, creating the risk of a bubble. A recent order making it easier for everyday savers to invest retirement funds in alternative assets such as private equity, real estate, and cryptocurrencies could further increase risks for investors, said Corey Frayer, of the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America. Still, analysts cautioned that the most successful investors tend to keep a longtime horizon and avoid overreacting in the short term. “The biggest risk is that, if we have a sell-off, these newer investors could cash out at the bottom,” said Wayne Wicker, president of McLean, Va.-based Opal Capital. “Markets can go a lot further with rich valuations than most people expect.”

Title: ICYMI: the week's 7 biggest tech stories from Xbox Game Pass' price hike to foldable iPhone teasers

Here's your firmware update for October 4, 2025 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. This week has rounded off September, or Tech-tember as we call it, with the last few events of the month, from Amazon to Google's big hardware and software reveals. We also watched the internet implode as Xbox Game Pass got a major price hike, leading many to question if the subscription is still a good deal for them. To catch up on all of this and more, scroll down for our recap of the week's seven biggest tech news stories. For ICYMI, we don’t normally include reports based on leaks and speculation, as while they can be right on the money, they can also be way off the mark – even from often reliable sources. We’re making an exception here as Samsung Display’s president Lee Cheong has said that the company is preparing to mass produce foldable phone panels for a North American client, and only one company comes to mind as this mysterious buyer: Apple. That’s because the long-awaited foldable iPhone is rumored to be launching next year, and Samsung Display has long been making its other iPhone screens. We’ve heard numerous rumors about what the foldable iPhone might look like, but expect something thin – it might even be thinner than the 5.6mm iPhone Air when unfolded. Pricing-wise, the most recent leaked price we’ve heard is $1,999 (around £1,500 / AU$3,050). The much-hyped Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses are finally available to the public in the US, and you can even book a demo to give them a whirl. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. This wearable is essentially Meta’s existing Ray-Ban smart glasses with a screen attached, offering additional functionality such as on-screen navigation, notification pop-ups, and even support for video calls. But with pairs starting at $799, you probably want to try them before you buy them. That’s why, using Meta’s official scheduler page, you can find a retailer near you offering 25-minute demos. Just be prepared to wait a while, as demos are already booked up for months – although as more stores offer the specs and roll them out to more regions, it should become easier to book a demo slot. Tilly Norwood is an AI ‘actress’ from “the world’s first artificial intelligence (AI) talent studio,” Xicoia, and she burst onto the scene via social media to look for agent representation. The creator asked folks to “judge her by merit,” but we and many others – especially notable Hollywood figures – have decided she’s a terrifying prospect for the world of entertainment that could remove humanity from upcoming shows and films. At these times, we can't help thinking of that viral quote from Joanna Maciejewska when it comes to the likes of Tilly Norwood: "I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes." If you use Meta AI’s chatbot on Facebook and Instagram, you might want to reconsider, as beginning December 16, your chats will influence the ads you see – and at the time of writing, you can’t opt out. "For example, if you chat with Meta AI about hiking, we may learn that you’re interested in hiking – just as we would if you posted a reel about hiking or liked a hiking-related Page. As a result, you might start seeing recommendations for hiking groups, posts from friends about trails, or ads for hiking boots," Meta explained in its announcement. Meta may be a pioneer here, but Google has discussed showing ads in Gemini and its AI Overviews, which appear at the top of search, while Amazon is using conversations with its Rufus AI chatbot for similar purposes. On Tuesday, Amazon held a huge hardware event in New York, and we were right there in the audience, bringing you the full lowdown on every device as it was announced. Some of the highlights included the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft, which feels just like writing on paper, integrates with OneDrive and Google Docs, new Echo smart speakers and smart displays, three new Fire TVs, and updated Ring cameras and doorbells. Everything is infused with AI courtesy of Alexa+, and we were able to get our hands (and ears) on everything to bring you our first impressions as soon as the presentations were over. Google’s smart home tech is finally set to get the much-anticipated Gemini update, which will bring more conversational interactions, improved assistance for setting up your automations, and better object detection for your smart cameras. Unfortunately, for the best features, you’ll need to start paying for a Google Home Premium subscription – yours for $10 a month or $100 a year (the Standard tier), or $20 a month or $200 a year (the Advanced tier). The good news is you won’t need to upgrade to the new Google Home Speaker (though you can if you want), as the update will be supported by all of Google’s home tech launched in the last decade. Microsoft set the internet on fire by announcing big changes coming to Xbox Game Pass. That is that a top-tier Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription now costs $29.99 / £22.99 / AU$35.95. This means that a year of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate – at $359.88 – costs only a little less than an Xbox Series S – with its recently increased $379.99 price. Now, Ultimate does come with some useful benefits. It now includes a Fortnite Crew membership (which nets you skins, 1,000 V-Bucks per month, and the Battle Pass), Ubisoft+ Classics (curated classic Ubisoft games), and shorter wait times and 1440p resolution when streaming. That said, many gamers haven’t taken this news well, with the page players would use to cancel their subscriptions crashing. Yikes! Don’t worry completely about the price rise, as you can still get Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $19.99 per month for now – while stock lasts.

Title: The Magnificent Seven Stocks Are Roaring Again. Can They Keep Climbing?

Time Published: 2025-10-03T17:57:53Z
Full Content:
Last year's Magnificent 7 tech leaders are rolling again. That hasn't always been the case this year. As a group, the the large-cap technology companies—Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA)—have lagged the broader market for most of 2025. That's led to questions about whether the grouping's reign is over or if its membership should change. Then came September's rally. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is now up nearly 20% year-to-date, ahead of the S&P 500's close to 15% gain; it more than doubled the benchmark index's performance in the third quarter. The question now: What next? The bullishness hasn't dried up. Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said Thursday that growth stocks, particularly those with ties to AI, were supported in the third quarter by strong earnings, expectations of AI-driven growth, and easing interest rates, which make borrowing less expensive. Wall Street analysts largely expect those trends to continue. There's wariness about a bubble in AI; Even Jeff Bezos has suggested that it's in a kind of "industrial bubble" in which it can be difficult for investors to identify the future winners and losers from the field of would-be standouts. Bank of America analysts on Friday said that "every bubble in history popped by central bank tightening, and no central bank in the world has hiked rates in past 2 months." A recent survey of Investopedia readers suggested cooling optimism about the stock market, though they said they remain heavily invested in growth stocks even with valuations at high levels. The Magnificent 7’s resurgence comes on the back of a rebound by tech heavyweights like Tesla and Apple, which had spent most of the year in the red. Their influence within the S&P 500, meanwhile, illustrates the power the group of tech giants have on global markets. The recent performance of some Magnificent 7 stocks highlights the breadth of the enthusiasm. AI darling Nvidia, which has seen its stock rise steadily since April as sales of its chips boomed and trade policy headwinds eased, remains the biggest gainer of the year. But Tesla, Google parent Alphabet, and Apple have been the biggest contributors to the group's advance in recent weeks after spending a large part of the year in negative territory. Gains for Tesla's stock, which added a third of its value in September, came as worries about CEO Elon Musk's political activities and slumping sales cooled, and bulls shifted their focus toward the electric vehicle maker's advances in autonomous driving, robotics, and AI. Alphabet climbed about 15% in September after a major legal win in which a federal judge ruled Google doesn't have to sell its Chrome browser. Apple rose close to 10% after signs of surprisingly strong demand for its latest iPhone 17 and inroads with the Trump administration. All this has many market watchers wondering when the party might end but unwilling to leave just yet. Pictet Asset Management Chief Strategist Luca Paolini on Friday noted the expectation of lower rates and strong corporate profits among reasons to "see upside in equities despite possible impacts of the US government shutdown." Pictet, he wrote, sees "upside in riskier asset classes in the short term." This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent market levels.

Dozens of firms are on the verge of gaining acceptance to create an ETF as one of the share classes of a mutual fund. October 3, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- For more than two decades, US money managers have looked on enviously as Vanguard Group reaped the benefits of a unique structure that grafted the advantages of an ETF onto its biggest mutual funds. The design, protected by patent, saved its investors billions of dollars and helped the Jack Bogle-founded firm grow into an $11 trillion giant. Now, in what could be the most consequential shift in the American investment industry in years, Vanguard is finally set to lose that competitive edge. Dozens of rival asset managers are on the brink of adopting the same structure, after the US Securities and Exchange Commission indicated it will allow the quantitative firm Dimensional Fund Advisors to do so in the coming weeks. Roughly 80 more competitors are in the queue for approval, including nearly every major name in the business. The model they want to follow creates an exchange-traded fund as one of the share classes of a mutual fund, a move that ports the famous tax efficiency of the younger structure to the older vehicle. Assuming the approvals come, it will likely trigger a wave of new ETF launches, re-write the tax and performance of countless mutual funds, and potentially finally erode the barrier that has until now largely locked ETFs out of the American retirement system. Related:12 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Oct. 7, 2025) “We already feel like we’re attached to a rocket ship, moving as fast as we can to launch more products,” said Brittany Christensen, head of business development and senior vice president at Tidal Financial Group, which helps create and run ETFs. “When I think about putting more fuel on that fire, that’s absolutely what this does.” Technical challenges to implementing the new structure remain, so the landscape won’t alter overnight. And since most major money managers already offer ETFs — having long ago given in to investor demand for the easier-to-trade, often cheaper vehicles — some market watchers have questioned how many will actually deploy it. But the size of the waitlist — more than six-times the number of firms that were racing for approval to launch Bitcoin funds — suggests huge industry-wide enthusiasm to take up the Vanguard blueprint. Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said it’s “like sitting on a bunch of CDs and here’s a chance to convert them all into digital.” Asset manager giants including BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price Group and Franklin Resources Inc. are among the firms seeking regulatory permission to deploy the hybrid structure. Some have been waiting for about two years, ever since Vanguard’s patent expired. Related:Advisors React to the Arrival of Dual-Share Fund Classes In a virtual meeting on Monday, the SEC told pending applicants they should conform their filings to that of DFA’s, but did not provide guarantees on when they would sign off on the next applications, according to four people familiar with the matter. BlackRock, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley and F/m Investments are among those that have already updated their paperwork. “This is big for the T. Rowes of this world that don’t already have super well-established ETF businesses and they’re suffering outflows from their mutual funds,” said Adam Sabban, associate director, equity strategies at Morningstar Inc. While it’s unclear if it will help generate new inflows, “it could help them retain their current assets and slow the pace of outflows,” he said. Some firms, including F/m, are looking to create mutual fund share classes of ETFs, opening the door for those products to break into 401ks. The pension system was built around mutual funds, and most platforms are not equipped to handle the intraday moves and liquidity of an ETF. Unexpectedly, even the pioneer of the ETF-within-a-mutual-fund model is on the waitlist. Vanguard only has permission to use the structure on passive funds, so the firm is now seeking approval to deploy it in active products. Related:11 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Sept. 30, 2025) “The multi-share class ETF structure has served Vanguard index investors well for more than two decades,” said a company spokesperson. “The structure has multiple benefits for both conventional mutual fund and ETF investors, and Vanguard looks forward to bringing the benefits of the multi-share class ETF structure to investors in active funds.” Malvern, Pennsylvania-based Vanguard first introduced the model in 2001, when ETFs were still in their infancy. Recognizing its potential value, the firm obtained a patent that restricted rivals from using it until 2023. Technically, the dual share class structure remained available for other issuers, provided they agreed a licensing arrangement with Vanguard and gained exemptive relief from the SEC. But in the years since granting Vanguard approval, the watchdog developed worries relating to conflicts of interest among share classes, and no other exemptions were given. The SEC said it intends to approve DFA’s relief application later in October, unless there is a request for a hearing on the matter. “For too long, the artificial divide between mutual fund and ETF share classes has limited investor choice, operational efficiency, and resulted in suboptimal tax treatment,” SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda said in a Monday statement. The proposed approval will facilitate competition because “similar relief has been long held by a single asset manager,” he said. The regulator said on Wednesday that owing to the government shutdown it was unable to provide further comment. The level of maturity already reached by the ETF industry may blunt the impact of the widespread use of the dual share class structure. Dave Nadig, president and director of research at etf.com, believes that any issuer with a decent approach will have pushed into ETFs years ago. Ben Fulton, CEO of WEBs Investments Inc., sees potential for this to be a “Y2K moment,” where significant time and resources are spent to achieve very little. Firms planning to deploy dual share classes face plenty of practical hurdles. A May report from JPMorgan Chase & Co. argued that launching a successful ETF strategy “is not just as simple as adding a share class to an existing mutual fund and expecting it to gain assets.” “An issuer needs to focus on the addition of capital markets services, a specific ETF distribution plan, platform strategies, and operational impacts as part of a successful launch plan,” the authors wrote. One issue is how firms will handle investors who want to switch, tax-free, from the mutual fund share class into the ETF class, to benefit from the intraday liquidity in the latter wrapper. The process is not automatic and requires both the asset manager and the individual investor to take action. “There’s some work left to be done with the platforms in terms of making that operationally more efficient,” Gerard O’Reilly, DFA’s co-CEO and co-CIO, told Bloomberg TV on Monday. DFA is hoping to have ETF share classes for a number of mutual funds available in the first couple months of 2026, he said. Meanwhile, issuers launching an ETF for the first time will need to liaise with market makers, which play a key role in keeping fund shares trading through the day — something not needed by mutual funds. If mutual fund companies launch ETF share classes en masse, it could put huge demand on the market-making ecosystem. It’s also an open question whether broker-dealers, who have strict requirements to operate in the best interest of their clients, will need to shift assets into the ETF share class, or whether they will be required to allow both share classes of the same fund on their platforms simultaneously. In a survey by Cerulli Associates in May, more than half of ETF issuers polled said “broker-dealer reluctance to approve/make share classes available on platform” was a significant challenge. “Although we’ve been working with several asset managers on operational readiness, I still think there’s going to be work for some of them — especially with the distribution channel, with the broker-dealers — to ensure that everyone’s ready for this,” said Frank Koudelka, global head of ETF Solutions at State Street. Still, the direction of travel is clear, according to Ben Johnson, head of client solutions at Morningstar. He said all concerns and obstacles facing the use of ETF share classes would be overcome within as little as three years. “ETFs are playing a starring role in life after mutual funds,” he said. “Their role is going to be elevated even further now.” Emily Graffeo Loukia Gyftopoulou You May Also Like Trusts & Estates for Advisors Oct 7, 2025 Content Spotlight Navigate today's complex financial landscape with our comprehensive 2025 Midyear Outlook.

Title: Sam Altman on AI bubble: ‘People make some dumb capital allocations’ from time to time

Full Content:
OpenAI could now be the world’s most valuable startup, ahead of Elon Musk’s SpaceX and TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, after a secondary stock sale designed to retain employees at the ChatGPT maker. Current and former OpenAI employees sold $6.6 billion in shares to a group of investors, pushing the privately held artificial intelligence company’s valuation to $500 billion, according to a source with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The investors buying the shares included Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, along with Japanese tech giant SoftBank and the United Arab Emirates’ MGX, the source said Thursday. The valuation reflects high expectations for the future of AI technology and continues OpenAI’s remarkable trajectory from its start as a nonprofit research lab in 2015. But with the San Francisco-based company not yet turning a profit, it could also amplify concerns about an AI bubble if the generative AI products made by OpenAI and its competitors don’t meet the expectations of investors pouring billions of dollars into research and development. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has sought to dismiss those concerns, most recently last week, when he toured a massive data center complex being built to run the company’s AI systems in Abilene, Texas. “Between the ten years we’ve already been operating and the many decades ahead of us, there will be booms and busts,” Altman said after being asked about a bubble. “People will overinvest and lose money, and underinvest and lose a lot of revenue.” He added that “we’ll make some dumb capital allocations” and there will be short-term ups and downs but that “over the arc that we have to plan over, we are confident that this technology will drive a new wave of unprecedented economic growth,” along with scientific breakthroughs, improvements to quality of life and “new ways to express creativity.” Just this week, the company launched two different business ventures, one a partnership with Etsy and Shopify for online shopping through ChatGPT and another a social media app, Sora, for generating and sharing AI videos. OpenAI has been struggling to offer investors and staff the same perks and compensation as the publicly traded tech giants with which it competes. Facebook parent Meta Platforms, in particular, has been on a hiring spree for elite AI engineers and in June made a $14.3 billion investment in AI company Scale that recruited its CEO Alexandr Wang. OpenAI’s for-profit subsidiary, valued at $500 billion, is technically controlled by the board of OpenAI’s nonprofit and both are still bound to pursue the nonprofit’s charitable purpose. OpenAI’s partnerships with major companies and its plans to change its corporate structure have drawn the scrutiny of regulators, including the attorneys general of California and Delaware, who oversee charitable organizations that operate or are incorporated in their states. The company has made big deals in recent weeks with Oracle and SoftBank, its partners on a data center venture called Stargate, and with chipmaker Nvidia, which makes the specialized AI chips those data centers need. At the same time, it has lessened its reliance on longtime backer Microsoft. In September, OpenAI announced it had reached a tentative agreement with Microsoft about the future stake of its nonprofit in its for-profit corporation but released few details. It also opened applications for nonprofits to apply for $50 million in funding from OpenAI, an effort it launched in response to the recommendations of an advisory board. The grants will go toward projects that increase public understanding of AI, support the design of AI for uses that communities want and increase economic opportunity. The deadline to apply closes on Oct. 8. —— AP Philanthropy Writer Thalia Beaty contributed to this report. ———- The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP’s text archives. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

LawNews PoliticsSocietyAnalysis International News Commentary Health CareNews Health CareCommentary PoliticsNews PoliticsNews SocietyNews InternationalNews PoliticsNews SecurityNews LawNews PoliticsNews Health CareNews PoliticsNews PoliticsNews PoliticsNews Commentary News International News International News SocietyNews PoliticsNews PoliticsCommentary Education Analysis SocietyCommentary PoliticsAnalysis Commentary Commentary Commentary Commentary SecurityNews FBI Director Kash Patel (Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images) Tyler O'Neil / @Tyler2ONeil Tyler O'Neil is senior editor at The Daily Signal and the author of two books: "Making Hate Pay: The Corruption of the Southern Poverty Law Center," and "The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government." FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL—The FBI has confirmed that it severed all ties to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a far-left activist group that puts conservatives and Christians on a “hate map” along with Ku Klux Klan chapters. The “hate map” has inspired at least one terrorist attack against a conservative organization. “The Southern Poverty Law Center long ago abandoned civil rights work and turned into a partisan smear machine,” FBI Director Kash Patel told The Daily Signal in a statement Friday. “Their so-called hate map has been used to defame mainstream Americans and even inspired violence.” “That disgraceful record makes them unfit for any FBI partnership,” Patel added. The FBI confirmed that it has no intelligence products from the SPLC and does not engage in contact or information sharing with the SPLC. The statement comes days after Patel told Fox News Digital that the FBI had severed ties with the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish nonprofit that opposes antisemitism but also leans left and condemns critics of transgender ideology. While the SPLC began as a public interest law firm focused on civil rights cases, it gained its reputation by suing Ku Klux Klan groups into bankruptcy and developed a decades-long relationship with law enforcement combating real hate. After the Klan largely disappeared, the SPLC started targeting mainstream conservative and Christian groups, putting them on a “hate map” alongside Klan chapters. In 2012, a domestic terrorist used the “hate map” to target the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian think tank in Washington, D.C. He planned to kill everyone in the building. A building manager largely foiled the attack, but suffered lifelong injuries in the process. The SPLC condemned the attack, but kept the council on the “hate map” ever since. The man who opened fire at a Republican practice session for the Congressional Baseball Game in 2017, nearly killing then-House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, had “liked” the SPLC on Facebook. The SPLC condemned that attack, as well. The SPLC added Turning Point USA to the “hate map” mere months before an assassin with a transgender boyfriend allegedly murdered Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. The SPLC condemned the attack, but has not removed Turning Point USA from the “hate map.” A bureau official told The Daily Signal that the FBI was aware that the “hate map” included Turning Point USA before the shooting. Patel noted that he had previously criticized the SPLC at a panel on anti-Christian bias. “In April, during our Anti-Christian Bias Panel, I made it clear that the FBI will never rely on politicized or agenda-driven intelligence from outside groups—and certainly not from the SPLC,” the FBI director told The Daily Signal. “Under this FBI, all ties with the SPLC have officially been terminated.” At that April event, Patel slammed the FBI under President Joe Biden’s administration, particularly for the notorious memo in which the FBI’s Richmond, Virginia, office (working with other field offices) urged agents to develop sources inside traditionalist Catholic churches and to target “Radical Traditional Catholic hate groups,” citing the SPLC. Critics have long accused the SPLC of being anti-Christian, and the group responded to these claims by noting that it does not put all Christian groups on the “hate map.” For years, the SPLC cited its decision not to put the organization Focus on the Family on the “hate map” as evidence it wasn’t anti-Christian. This year, it added Focus to the map. In 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions pledged that the Justice Department would not partner with groups like the SPLC. The Biden administration reversed that, however. The SPLC has tremendous impact inside and outside of law enforcement. Then-SPLC President Margaret Huang bragged in a 2021 donor meeting that “many agencies in the new Biden administration” reached out to “solicit our expertise” to “help shape the policies that the new administration is adopting to counter the domestic terrorism threat.” That wasn’t hyperbole. The Justice Department received a briefing from the SPLC shortly after it added Moms for Liberty to the “hate map” in June 2023. Big Tech companies like Amazon have used the “hate map” to screen recipients for its former AmazonSmile program, where customers could designate a portion of their purchases go to support certain charities and other nonprofits. Companies like Eventbrite, PayPal, and Hyatt Hotels have relied on the SPLC’s “hate” accusations to decide who they will allow to use their platforms and facilities. Donor networks worth billions have pledged to keep charitable funds from going to SPLC-labeled “hate groups.” The SPLC enjoys this impact despite multiple scandals. The center fired its co-founder and saw its president resign in a 2019 racial discrimination and sexual harassment scandal. Amid that scandal, SPLC staff created a union that is part of a union organization that represents the radical anti-Israel group Jewish Voice for Peace. And amid a round of layoffs last year, the SPLC Union accused the center of engaging in “union-busting.” Despite its penurious name, the SPLC has an endowment of more than $700 million, compensates its leaders handsomely, and possesses more than $30 million in offshore accounts, according to IRS filings. Finally, the SPLC has troubling ties to Antifa, the loosely-organized movement of far-left agitators that President Donald Trump recently declared a domestic terrorist group.

Rainx Drive is the Best Cloud Storage Platform Today, even with President Trump’s victory, leftist elites have their tentacles in every aspect of our government. The Daily Signal’s own Tyler O’Neil exposes this leftist cabal in his new book, The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government. In this book, O’Neil reveals how the Left’s NGO apparatus pursues its woke agenda, maneuvering like an octopus by circumventing Congress and entrenching its interests in the federal government.

Title: Lenovo LOQ 15 Gen10 review

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Lenovo's hit the mark just right on three things in particular. The graphics card. The screen. The build quality. It's exceptional in those elements and delivers excellent 1080p gaming performance. Sadly, however, due to what are assumedly cost-cutting measures on the RAM and SSD front, it doesn't quite nail the landing with its entry-level model. PC Gamer's got your back Our experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you. Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. You know what my biggest bugbear is for budget laptops? It's the screen. It is always the screen. For some reason, notebook manufacturers seem to have this almost obsession with pairing massively underwhelming graphics cards with panels that would put most 4K TVs to shame. It's madness. Yes, they might be these phenomenally pixel-dense, OLED, 240 Hz, crystal-clear colour, uber mode displays, capable of projecting the most beautiful, stunning picture you've ever seen in your life directly into your retinas. But as soon as you load up a game and that mobile GPU kicks into life, fans whirring at a million miles a minute, you'll inevitably be graced with the slow chug of growing disappointment, as the approximation of a AAA power-point presentation starts juddering its way across your shiny new device. It's driven me mad for years. That might sound ridiculous, I'll admit that, but I've reviewed a lot of budget laptops in my time that do this, and it's frustrating because it doesn't need to be the case. You gain very little by doing that. Thank the dear and fluffy lord Gabe Newell then (he doesn't have anything to do with this, I don't think, I haven't checked), that Lenovo's LOQ 15 Gen10 ditches that seemingly age-old laptop manufacturer mantra in favor of a more practical GPU and screen pairing instead. At its core, the Gen10 comes complete with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060, a Ryzen 7 250, and, more importantly than that, a simple, elegant, beautifully crisp and punchy 15.6-inch, 1920x1080 IPS display, running at around 144 Hz. And it does all of that with a sub $1400 price point. Now, yes, I know what you're thinking, technically, no, that graphics card isn't really a "true" RTX 5060. I mean, it sort of is, so far as the name's the same and the core RTX Blackwell architecture matches it as well, but it's lost about 15% of its CUDA cores, and a not-so-subtle 12% of everything else, (ray tracing cores, ROPs, TMUs, Tensor cores, you know, all the good stuff that makes DLSS 4, kinda, work). Heck, I suppose we should be thankful it still touts that same 8 GB of GDDR7 VRAM. Model No: 15AHP10CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 250GPU: Nvidia RTX 5060 115WRAM: 16 GB DDR5-5600Storage: 512 GB PCIe 4.0 SSDScreen Size: 15.6-inch IPSRefresh Rate: 144 HzResolution: 1920 x 1080Battery: 60 WhrDimensions: 15.6 ~ 23.9 mm x 359.9 mm x 258.7 mm | 0.94 x 14.17 x 10.19 inchesWeight: 2.3 kg | 5.07 lbsPrice: $1,389 | £1,300 The good news, though, is that on the whole, that mobile RTX 5060 does actually deliver when it comes to 1080p gaming. Most titles easily averaged well into the 60 fps mark and above, the only exception, of course, being Cyberpunk 2077 without any DLSS support (which still achieved a relatively respectable 36 fps). Chuck on DLSS Quality and the beautiful silky goodness that is MFG, and that too climbs well into the 100s. It's so refreshing to be able to just game at your native resolution on a laptop at this price point, without having to worry about dialling the graphics preset down, or swapping around resolutions and getting stretched pixels or worse. Plus, that 15.6-inch screen is already delivering a pixel density greater than a 32-inch 4K panel does. Alrighty. Stop the press, cancel the review, clearly this is the best gaming laptop of 2025, right? Isn't that right, tiny human? Well, just hang on one minute. It's not all sun-lit uplands and frame rates. We need to talk about the storage and memory setup on this thing. Because, to be blunt. It sucks. In its default configuration, the one I'm testing here, the LOQ 15 comes with a single stick of 16 GB DDR5 at 5,600 MT/s. Do you know what Ryzen loves more than memory frequency? Memory bandwidth. There are times, particularly when loading programs, running multiple applications, or intense, high-load activities, when you almost feel this stuttering effect occur on the Gen10. There's a lag as you attempt to move an application across the screen or open up Task Manager. It's chilling to be blunt, giving Windows Vista vibes, and I don't like it. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. For an additional $65, Lenovo will pop an extra 16 GB stick in there for you, but to be honest, this should've been two 8GB dual-channel sticks to begin with, retaining that budget price point. At least so you're not left wondering if the whole system's locking up because you just opened Paint, or because your memory setup sucks. Again, on the SSD front, it's similarly just not good enough. The stock model is a SanDisk WD Blue SN5000S, QLC affair, not too dissimilar from the WD Blue SN5000 I reviewed late last year. That's fine, nothing particularly wrong with that for a budget unit. At least, that is, until you see the capacity. It's a 512 GB model, which once Windows is installed, sits at around 370 GB of total available space. I couldn't even install our entire benchmarking suite in one go; it was that small. I had to test games, then delete them and install other games and then test those… Again, Lenovo will happily pop in a 1 TB variant, but for an additional $60 added on to the price tag, which should've been included as standard, given it's a gaming laptop. My list of mild grievances continues with the battery life, which petered out at just 89 minutes. Although that is better than some of the more premium, more power-hungry units out there, the LOQ is generally hampered by its relatively small 60 WHr battery and AMD's relatively power-hungry Ryzen 7 250 CPU. Now, I've been harsh here, I have. This is a budget notebook, effectively. It can't all be brilliant at the end of it all, and there is still a lot to love about it, far beyond that of just the screen being the right pick for that graphics card. CPU performance is impressive, even with that single-channel memory, and it beats out other RTX 5060 notebooks like Gigabyte's Gaming A16 in average fps too, that one in particular featuring an Intel Core i7-13620H (a damning indictment of Intel's currently poor Ultra line gaming performance, it'd seem), which is nothing to sniff at. And the overall build quality of this thing? Purely outstanding. It is a gaming notebook; you can tell that from the get-go, there's no hiding that. There are angles and edges, embossed logos, and a jutting webcam divot, among other things, along with a whole host of I/O ports protruding out of its bottom. But it's not ostentatious. There's a suaveness to it, from the "luna grey" metallic satin finish to the heft and bulk of the thing. It feels solid, yet remains sleek, like it's designed for even the most aggro of esports streamers to wail on after they go 0-3 in competitive. I've played around with laptops four times the cost of this thing that pale in comparison when it comes to the build quality on show here, and that's not nothing. ✅ You don't mind the upgrade path: There's no denying it. The single-channel memory and 512 GB SSD on the base model are massively underwhelming. If you don't mind spending a little extra or can upgrade the two, then the Lenovo LOQ 15 is a fine choice for 1080p gaming. ❌ You're looking for something with a bit more flair: Aside from the above, the LOQ is very much a marmite style. You'll either love how subtle it is for a gaming notebook or despise it. If you're looking for something a little flashier, this ain't it. Cooling is impressive as well, and throughout my time testing, temps rarely got over 70 degrees, even under intense loads. Yes, fan noise is a thing, particularly when it's plugged in, but it's all manageable in Lenovo's Legion app, which, although relatively barebones, does a good enough job of managing noise in exchange for heat, which again you've got a good 20 degrees to play with. There are, of course, your state-mandated AI apps integrated in here as well, requiring Lenovo account sign-up and more, along with the usual intrusive McAfee anti-virus pre-install to be aware of, but from a software perspective, that's about it for bloatware. Elegant. Sophisticated. Well paired. Dialled in to a T. Yet flawed. That is what the LOQ 15 represents. With resplendent gaming performance and a sleek, sharp design that eschews the usual "gamer" nonsense in favor of sophisticated style instead, it's a laptop that checks a lot of boxes. Yet, it's not without fault, and although it entertains well enough, it could've been far, far better if only Lenovo had tweaked that entry-level model's configuration first. Still, for the price, you'd be hard pressed to find an RTX 5060 notebook that packs as much punch as the LOQ 15 does into that price, and for that, I doth my hat to you fine Lenovo, you have done well. Lenovo's hit the mark just right on three things in particular. The graphics card. The screen. The build quality. It's exceptional in those elements and delivers excellent 1080p gaming performance. Sadly, however, due to what are assumedly cost-cutting measures on the RAM and SSD front, it doesn't quite nail the landing with its entry-level model.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin BTC$111,480.33 may be entering a decisive phase as macro and crypto-specific forces converge. With the U.S. government shutdown and traditional market indicators like employment reports delayed, traders are leaning into alternative assets, especially bitcoin and gold. BTC climbed to $120,000 after rallying 9% this week, while gold rose 2.9% to touch $3,900. The shutdown has furloughed over 90% of SEC staff and left the CFTC with a skeleton crew. Reacting to the shutdown markets rallied, as investors see the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates by 25 bps later this month as a near certainty over an unexpected drop in U.S. private payrolls and a delay in other key economic data. “Traders have lacked immediate catalysts, evidenced by subdued commitment following the FOMC meeting, even as gold and equities have posted strong gains. However, the broader trend remains higher as we move into a rate-cutting cycle,” Jake Ostrovskis, Head of OTC Trading at Wintermute, told CoinDesk. Lower interest rates make risk assets like cryptocurrencies more attractive, and that’s coming in a month where sentiment is high given historical performance. "October has historically been a bullish month for bitcoin, and early signs suggest this year may be no exception." said Gadi Chait of Xapo Bank, in an emailed statement. "Far from being a speculative outlier, bitcoin continues to show its ability to defy the odds and assert itself as a digital asset with staying power.” On-chain data backs that up. Apparent bitcoin demand has grown by roughly 62,000 BTC per month since July, according to CryptoQuant, driven largely by ETFs and whales. For context, ETF holdings surged by 71% in fourth-quarter 2024. On top of that, the crypto-native market has kept on growing. “Over the past month, DeFi’s share of trading activity has been climbing significantly, expanding both the market and our opportunity,” dYdX Labs President Eddie Zhang told CoinDesk. “A big driver of this shift is the renewed energy and participation we’re seeing out of Asia. We believe DeFi is beginning to fulfill its long-standing promise, and the pace of market adoption is accelerating in response." Looking ahead, crypto markets are anticipating other potential catalysts: ETF decisions for several altcoins including solana and XRP that could be delayed over the shutdown, and Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade, which is slowly moving closer.

Profile news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Furloughed federal workers were already drained and demoralized by months of layoffs and funding cuts, then came the government shutdown. Frustrated young Trump supporters express what they want to see out of the president. And, Taylor Swift album drops have always been an event; her 12th one was no different. Here's what to know today. Furloughed federal employees won't be paid until Congress passes legislation to fund the government. And with neither side showing signs of budging as the shutdown enters its third day, some federal employees say they are "sad," "scared" and "afraid." While most of the furloughed employees won't be allowed to work during the shutdown, others who are deemed essential — such as members of the military and airport security screeners — will continue working without pay. Federal workers typically receive back pay once the government reopens, but that requires congressional approval. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. In addition to the uncertainty around paychecks, the Trump administration has threatened to use the shutdown as a pretext to carry out more mass firings. That's left federal workers, already drained and demoralized by months of layoffs and funding cuts, scrambling to figure out how to cope with the possibility of weeks without pay and a new round of layoffs, according to nearly two dozen federal workers who reached out to NBC News. The wife of a Department of Homeland Security worker in Ohio said that her bank rejected her request for a deferment on her mortgage. Like nearly all federal employees whom NBC News spoke with, she asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation by the Trump administration, which has publicly fired federal workers it has deemed as being against its agenda. "I was never afraid to speak my mind before, I never felt afraid to talk. Now, people are afraid," an Arizona TSA worker said, explaining her concerns over speaking publicly about how the shutdown is impacting her. She will have to continue working without pay during the shutdown. Read the full story. President Donald Trump's victory last year was fueled in part by young voters. But new focus groups reveal why some young voters who backed his campaign are beginning to sour on his administration's approach to immigration and the economy. Fourteen swing-state Trump voters under age 30 participated in recent focus groups observed by NBC News as part of the 2025 "Deciders" series, produced by Syracuse University and the research firms Engagious and Sago. Nine said they disapproved of Trump's overall job performance so far, while five approved. The group included eight self-identified independents and six Republicans. And while some of the voters in the focus groups detailed concerns about Trump, that didn’t necessarily mean they're inclined to support Democrats. Many of them described the Democratic Party as weak and out of touch. Read the full story. Sean "Diddy" Combs apologized and expressed how "sorry" he was "for all of the hurt and pain" he caused in a letter to the judge set to sentence him on two prostitution-related convictions today. Combs, who faces up to 20 years in prison, also asked for mercy, writing he has "been humbled and broken to my core." The letter marks the first time that Combs has addressed U.S. District Court Judge Arun Subramanian in any meaningful way. During the eight-week federal trial, Combs did not testify and gave brief answers to questions from the judge. Read the full story. Taylor Swift has already broken records with her latest album, "The Life of a Showgirl," being the most pre-saved album ever on Spotify, making her the first female artist to exceed 100 million album sales. The album features a dozen tracks and reunited her with Swedish producers Max Martin and Shellback, diverging from her good friend Jack Antonoff, who produced her most recent albums. Fans are also expected to flock to movie theaters this weekend to catch "Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl," which the singer described as a "dazzling soirée." The theatrical event will include the premiere of the music video for "The Fate of Ophelia." Read the latest updates on "The Life of a Showgirl" in our liveblog. Perhaps, nobody knows more about how to sound like Trump than Ryan Chen, a social media star from "CHI-na." Though Chen has never set foot in the U.S., he sounds as American as the president himself, nailing Trump's tone, rambling cadence, and the signature hand gestures. In his first U.S. media interview, Chen told NBC News that he posted his first Trump impression video last fall just as a dare. But the clip went viral. So, he just kept going. Chen's popularity continues to grow at home and abroad even amid the U.S.-China trade war. However, Chen said his videos aren't about politics, and he just wants to make people laugh by introducing Chinese food and culture to foreigners in Trump's accent. – Peter Guo, associate producer Still unsure what's actually worth buying during Prime Big Deal Days?

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley and ranking member Richard Durbin have also questioned Amazon, Apple, Deloitte, Google, JPMorgan Chase, Meta, Microsoft, and Walmart, asking them for details on their hiring and recruitment practices as well as any variation in salary and benefits between H-1B visa holders and American employees. The senators said their "inquiry" comes at a time when the unemployment rate in America’s tech sector is "well above" the overall jobless rate. According to the Federal Reserve, recent American graduates with STEM degrees now face higher unemployment rates than the general population, they stated. It is pertinent to mention that Senators Grassley and Durbin have been vocal critics of the H-1B visa programme and have consistently contended that these visas are being abused by many to replace US workers with cheaper labour from overseas. In fact, just a few days after their missive to the ten companies, the senators said they are reintroducing bipartisan legislation to "reform and close loopholes" in the H-1B and L-1 visa programs. The H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act targets fraud and abuse in US immigration system, provides protection for American workers and visa holders and enhances transparency in the foreign worker recruitment process, the two argued. "In evaluating the high unemployment rate for American tech workers, we cannot ignore the massive, ongoing layoffs ordered by you and your peers in Big Tech C-suites over the past few years...At the same time you have been laying off your employees, you have been filing H-1B visa petitions for (thousands of) foreign workers,” the Senators wrote in letters to 10 major employers in the US on September 25, 2025. They added: "With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that (you) cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions." On TCS, the statement noted that the company recently announced plans to lay off over 12,000 employees, including American staff. "In fiscal year 2025, TCS applied for and received approval to hire 5,505 foreign H1-1B employees. TCS is currently under investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly firing older American employees in favour of newly hired foreign H-1B visa holders," it said. It further said Cognizant Technology Solutions laid off thousands of workers, including employees in the US. "In fiscal year 2025, Cognizant applied for and received approval to hire 2,493 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a federal jury concluded Cognizant favoured South Asian H1-B visa holders over American employees, which warranted punitive damages," it added. E-mails sent to TCS and Cognizant for comments by PTI did not elicit a response. The statement by Grassley and Durbin noted that Amazon laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years, blaming the adoption of generative AI tools. In fiscal year 2025, Amazon applied for and received approval to hire 10,044 foreign H-1B employees. Google, it said, laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years, including hundreds of workers in its platform and device unit, and 35 per cent of its small team managers "despite enjoying records profits". In fiscal year 2025, Google applied for and received approval to hire 4,181 foreign H1-B employees, the statement observed. According to it, Meta laid off a quarter of its workforce between 2022 and 2023 and labelled it a "year of efficiency". "In 2025, Meta laid off 3,600 employees, overshooting its stated goal of laying off another five per cent of its workforce. In fiscal year 2025, Meta applied for and received approval to hire 5,123 foreign H-1B employees," it said. Microsoft applied for and received approval to hire 5,189 foreign H1-B employees in fiscal year 2025, as per the statement. Microsoft laid off 16,000 employees this year alone, despite record revenue and profits, it said adding amid criticism for mass-layoffs, Microsoft characterised its actions as an "enigma of success".

Title: How Microsoft Stock Rises 2x To $1,000
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/03/how-microsoft-stock-rises-2x-to-1000/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. We are fond of companies that generate cash. A lot of cash. What about 2% of market capitalization? Microsoft’s stock is valued at $3.9 trillion and generated $71.6 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2025, which is about 1.8% of its market capitalization. On a per-share basis, that’s $9.60 of free cash flow for a $520 stock. What’s not to adore? This cash accumulates on the balance sheet, can be reinvested, and fuels buybacks. Microsoft’s operating cash flow margin is at 48.3%, resulting in $136 billion from $282 billion in revenue. Net income? An astonishing $102 billion – a net margin of approximately 36%, marking the inaugural occasion that Microsoft surpassed the $100 billion profit threshold. The balance sheet resembles a fortress, boasting $95 billion in cash compared to $61 billion in debt, indicating a robust net cash position. Simultaneously, Microsoft returned $37 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks within the last twelve months alone. See – Why Microsoft Stock Is A Shareholder’s Paradise? – for additional insights. Although Microsoft stock has experienced a strong year, appreciating by 24% and surpassing the NASDAQ’s 18% gain, the crucial question now is: Is there still room for Microsoft stock to grow? An in-depth examination of the company's fundamentals indicates that the answer is yes, as growth is swiftly accelerating. Microsoft reported impressive results for fiscal year 2025, with revenue and operating income rising in the mid to high teens. A key contributor to this performance is the Intelligent Cloud segment. Azure alone surpassed $75 billion in annual revenue, exhibiting remarkable growth of 34% year-over-year. Artificial Intelligence (AI) services are a major tailwind, accounting for 19 percentage points of that growth. The company is sustained by several massive, long-term growth drivers—most notably, the expansion of its AI offerings. These factors are anticipated to drive the stock to significantly higher levels, potentially doubling from its current price to exceed $1,000. We will delve into these specific growth drivers in greater detail. That being said, if you’re looking for upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like Microsoft, consider the High Quality Portfolio. This portfolio has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is this the case? The HQ Portfolio stocks as a group have provided better returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; showcasing less volatility, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – What’s Next For CoreWeave Stock? Let’s analyze the figures. Microsoft generated $281.7 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025, showing an accelerating growth trend. With AI adoption driving sustained annual revenue growth of 17% and margin expansion through operational leverage, sales could reach $450 billion by 2028. Microsoft’s operating margins are expected to expand to 50% as high-margin AI services scale up and operational efficiency improves. This equates to roughly $225 billion in operating income, or about $180 billion in net income after taxes. With ongoing share repurchases decreasing the float, the share count could trend toward 7.2 billion shares. This would imply an EPS of around $25 per share by 2028. Now, let’s discuss valuation. While Microsoft currently trades at 38 times trailing earnings (based on fiscal 2025 results), its AI monetization narrative justifies a premium valuation. Given Microsoft’s robust growth, superior margins, and strong cash flow generation, we do not expect any significant compression in multiples over the next three years. Despite Microsoft’s promising outlook, potential risks could impede the stock from doubling. The most significant concern is the normalization of AI spending, where businesses may become more cautious about initiating new Azure projects, implying that the current investment pace may not be sustainable indefinitely. Additionally, heightened competition from Google, Amazon, and emerging entities could exert pressure on Microsoft’s AI pricing power and market share growth. See, investing in a single stock without a thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (comprising the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to generate strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced combination of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered a responsive method to maximize gains during favorable market conditions while mitigating losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. Microsoft's investment appeal is compelling. Record cash generation of $72 billion and an indomitable balance sheet finance both aggressive AI infrastructure investments and steady shareholder returns, while diverse exposure across cloud, AI, enterprise software, and gaming diminishes risk and positions the company for continued long-term growth. The anticipated $70 billion AI infrastructure investment fosters competitive advantages that enhance market share growth, with additional upside potential arising from AI-driven margin expansion while sustaining accelerating growth. That said, investors should judiciously consider the risks prior to investing in Microsoft.

October 03, 2025 05:52 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Oct. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Strategic Intelligence - Unmanned Ground Vehicles" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This report explores emergent trends within the UGV market, examining use cases and the implementation of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and remote sensors, and what challenges must be considered in pursuing effective strategies for brand building in this market.UGVs are finally making a mark in modern warfare, and their use can have severe strategic and financial consequences. To overcome developmental hurdles, companies, nations, and militaries are increasingly adopting a collaborative approach. This approach involves public and private investment in the sector and constant experimentation in Ukraine.Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) have been a distant second thought for those thinking about the future of unmanned warfare. Indeed, Russia's unprovoked war of aggression in Ukraine has demonstrated the utility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned maritime vehicles (UMVs), but until recently, UGVs have rarely been mentioned. Yet warfare drives innovation, and the UGV sector has been developed by Ukrainian fighters seeking to manage personnel shortages. Since the start of that war, the use of UGVs for logistical, engineering, surveillance, and combat support roles has exploded, and Ukraine now plans to deliver 15,000 ground robots for combat use by the end of 2025. While it is important to recognize that UGVs still account for a fraction of the total of unmanned support in conflicts, the utility of UGVs has at long last been exploited by those on the battlefield. Modern UGVs are now suitable for a wide variety of defense and security applications beyond the traditionally limited scope of explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), with nations including China, France, India, Russia, the UK, and the US developing logistics, ISR, and combat-capable UGV platforms.To capitalize on the growth of the UGV market, key industry players have been investing heavily in expanding their research, development, and manufacturing capabilities, with both established defense primes like Rheinmetall and KMW as well as emerging players such as EDGE Group engaging in mergers and acquisitions of specialist firms within the UGV supply chain to pre-emptively secure market shares in an emerging capability sector. Firms with expertise in associated technologies such as AI, weapons systems, mobility solutions, and power supply/management will also benefit from growing demand as the diversified applications for UGVs provide new opportunities to engage with primes and forge strategic partnerships to cement their positions within the supply chain.Studies of emerging technological trends and their broader impact on the defense market.Analysis of the various unmanned ground vehicle programs and projects currently under development, as well as the impact of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence on the future outlook of the unmanned ground vehicles theme.Scope Reasons to Buy Key Topics Covered: Companies Featured For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/3bitvn About ResearchAndMarkets.comResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

Title: How posting on TikTok helped this 22-year-old land a software engineering role at Amazon after a yearlong job hunt

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In May, Andrew Chen couldn't stop thinking about the ticking clock. He was just weeks away from earning his computer science degree from the University of California San Diego — and still didn't have a job lined up. Then a glimmer of hope landed in his inbox: an email from Amazon inviting him to interview for a software engineering role in 10 days. He knew he couldn't waste the opportunity, so he made a plan: hole up in his room to study — and document his preparation for the big day on TikTok to hold himself accountable. "I canceled all my social obligations, locked myself in my room, and basically only left the house to have lunch," said the 22-year-old. "I was thinking, if I don't get this job, this is all for nothing." Chen is among the many recent college graduates who have struggled to find work. As of June, the most recent data available, 4.8% of Americans ages 22 to 27 with at least a bachelor's degree were unemployed — higher than the 4.0% jobless rate among the broader working-age population, a reversal from the typical trend in recent decades. These challenges reflect a broader hiring slowdown that's hit entry-level job seekers especially hard. Amid tariff uncertainty and the early effects of AI adoption, US companies are hiring at one of the slowest paces since 2014. Tech professionals, including computer science graduates like Chen, have been particularly affected, with layoffs at firms including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. On Indeed, US software development job postings have declined by over 70% from their peak in 2022. While some new graduates are still searching, others, like Chen, have used creative job-search and interview preparation strategies to secure offers. We want to hear from job seekers and people who recently landed a job. If you're open to sharing your story, please fill out one of the linked Google Forms above — or contact this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com (or Signal at jzinkula.29). You can also find more of our job market coverage below: Chen began looking for a full-time job in the summer of 2024. As a computer science major, he'd always envisioned starting his career in software engineering. But after applying to more than 400 jobs and struggling to gain traction, he expanded his search to include product management and design roles. But he didn't give up on software engineering. Between September 2024 and early February 2025, Chen applied to several software engineering roles at Amazon. In mid-February, he was asked to complete an online assessment for one of the roles he had applied to — he's still unsure exactly which one — that included a coding test and behavioral questions. He thought he had done well — news he excitedly shared with his parents — but as the months passed, he never received an update about his application status. "My parents would keep asking for updates on Amazon because it's a name brand," he said. "And I eventually told them I got rejected — I thought if I hadn't heard from them after months, it's probably not going to happen." By the time Amazon reached out in May, Chen said he was deep in interviews for product management and design roles — and had nearly given up on software engineering entirely. The unexpected opportunity to return to his preferred field was welcome, but its timing posed a challenge. After focusing on other types of roles, he'd largely stopped practicing his coding skills and would need to quickly brush up before the interview. Chen had just 10 days to prepare — and still had to carve out time for interviews with other companies, in addition to school exams and final projects. So he developed a plan of attack, dividing his days into blocks for coding practice on LeetCode, behavioral prep, and studying for other interviews. He set out to read everything he could on platforms like Reddit and Blind about Amazon's interview process and past candidates' experiences, practice common technical questions, study the company's leadership principles, and memorize STAR-format personal stories that illustrated how he embodied those values. "This was the first big company that had given me a chance in a while," he said, "so I really wanted to get this one." But pulling this all off seemed daunting, and Chen felt he needed something to help him stay motivated. Then he had an idea. He'd been interested in creating social media content for a while but had only posted a handful of TikToks. What if he started documenting his preparation for the Amazon interview? Sharing updates publicly on TikTok, he figured, would add the kind of pressure he needed to stay locked in — and maybe even attract advice from others who'd been through the process. On May 19, Chen posted a TikTok with the caption "10 days until FAANG final interview," sharing how much prep he'd done, how many classes he'd skipped, how much caffeine he'd consumed, and how many showers he'd taken. He followed it with similar updates in the days that followed. Chen said his videos — which received as many as 2.6 million views — drew a wide range of reactions, including skepticism that he could land the role given his limited preparation time. "The videos brought a lot of doubt from viewers, but thankfully also a lot of advice and encouragement," he said. When interview day arrived in late May, Chen was anxious and sleep-deprived. He said his Amazon "loop" interview process consisted of three back-to-back virtual interviews with short breaks in between. The first round focused on technical questions, the second on behavioral scenarios tied to Amazon's leadership principles, and the third included a mix of both. "I was thinking that these few hours will determine if I am employed," he said. Chen gradually settled in as the day went on and left the interviews feeling like he'd done his best. On June 3, shortly after finishing his third interview of the day for non-Amazon roles, he saw an email notification on his phone. He'd received an offer from Amazon with a six-figure salary. On June 5, Chen posted a TikTok with the news that received over 941,000 views. He graduated in mid-June and, after moving to New York City, started working full-time in July. Chen said his biggest takeaway from the Amazon interviews was the company's emphasis on behavioral questions tied to its leadership principles — something he felt played to his strengths. "They care a lot about your success stories outside your technical expertise," he said. "I think I'm a better talker than a coder, so I was very excited for that." One of his top pieces of advice for job seekers: while application quality matters, volume is essential in a tough market. "Many times I did feel hopeless, but I think it truly is a numbers game," he said. "You just need to apply to everything you're qualified for." Jump to

Title: The AI Bubble and the U.S. Economy: How Long Do “Hallucinations” Last?

Read about why we’re doing this fundraiser, what we’ve accomplished in the last year, and our current goal, supporting our expanded daily Links Yves here. This is a devastating, must-read paper by Servaas Storm on how AI is failing to meet core, repeatedly hyped performance promises, and never can, irrespective of how much money and computing power is thrown at it. Yet AI, which Storm calls “Artificial Information” is still garnering worse-than-dot-com-frenzy valuations even as errors are if anything increasing. By Servaas Storm, Senior Lecturer of Economics, Delft University of Technology. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website This paper argues that (i) we have reached “peak GenAI” in terms of current Large Language Models (LLMs); scaling (building more data centers and using more chips) will not take us further to the goal of “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI); returns are diminishing rapidly; (ii) the AI-LLM industry and the larger U.S. economy are experiencing a speculative bubble, which is about to burst. The U.S. is undergoing an extraordinary AI-fueled economic boom: The stock market is soaring thanks to exceptionally high valuations of AI-related tech firms, which are fueling economic growth by the hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars they are spending on data centers and other AI infrastructure. The AI investment boom is based on the belief that AI will make workers and firms significantly more productive, which will in turn boost corporate profits to unprecedented levels. But the summer of 2025 did not bring good news for enthusiasts of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) who were all hyped up by the inflated promise of the likes of OpenAI’s Sam Altman that “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI), the holy grail of current AI research, would be right around the corner. Let us more closely consider the hype. Already in January 2025, Altman wrote that “we are now confident we know how to build AGI”. Altman’s optimism echoed claims by OpenAI’s partner and major financial backer Microsoft, which had put out a paper in 2023 claiming that the GPT-4 model already exhibited “sparks of AGI.” Elon Musk (in 2024) was equally confident that the Grok model developed by his company xAI would reach AGI, an intelligence “smarter than the smartest human being”, probably by 2025 or at least by 2026. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that his company was committed to “building full general intelligence”, and that super-intelligence is now “in sight”. Likewise, Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, said “powerful AI”, i.e., smarter than a Nobel Prize winner in any field, could come as early as 2026, and usher in a new age of health and abundance — the U.S. would become a “country of geniuses in a datacenter”, if ….. AI didn’t wind up killing us all. For Mr. Musk and his GenAI fellow travelers, the biggest hurdle on the road to AGI is the lack of computing power (installed in data centers) to train AI bots, which, in turn, is due to a lack of sufficiently advanced computer chips. The demand for more data and more data-crunching capabilities will require about $3 trillion in capital just by 2028, in the estimation of Morgan Stanley. That would exceed the capacity of the global credit and derivative securities markets. Spurred by the imperative to win the AI-race with China, the GenAI propagandists firmly believe that the U.S. can be put on the yellow brick road to the Emerald City of AGI by building more data centers faster (an unmistakenly “accelerationist” expression). Interestingly, AGI is an ill-defined notion, and perhaps more of a marketing concept used by AI promotors to persuade their financiers to invest in their endeavors. Roughly, the idea is that an AGI model can generalize beyond specific examples found in its training data, similar to how some human beings can do almost any kind of work after having been shown a few examples of how to do a task, by learning from experience and changing methods when needed. AGI bots will be capable of outsmarting human beings, creating new scientific ideas, and doing innovative as well as all of routine coding. AI bots will be telling us how to develop new medicines to cure cancer, fix global warming, drive our cars and grow our genetically modified crops. Hence, in a radical bout of creative destruction, AGI would transform not just the economy and the workplace, but also systems of health care, energy, agriculture, communications, entertainment, transportation, R&D, innovation and science. OpenAI’s Altman boasted that AGI can “discover new science,” because “I think we’ve cracked reasoning in the models,” adding that “we’ve a long way to go.” He “think[s] we know what to do,” saying that OpenAI’s o3 model “is already pretty smart,” and that he’s heard people say “wow, this is like a good PhD.” Announcing the launch of ChatGPT-5 in August, Mr. Altman posted on the internet that “We think you will love using GPT-5 much more than any previous Al. It is useful, it is smart, it is fast [and] intuitive. With GPT-5 now, it’s like talking to an expert — a legitimate PhD level expert in anything any area you need on demand, they can help you with whatever your goals are.” But then things began to fall apart, and rather quickly so. ChatGPT-5 Is a Letdown The first piece of bad news is that much-hyped ChatGPT-5 turned out to be a dud — incremental improvements wrapped in a routing architecture, nowhere near the breakthrough to AGI that Sam Altman had promised. Users are underwhelmed. As the MIT Technology Review reports: “The much-hyped release makes several enhancements to the ChatGPT user experience. But it’s still far short of AGI.” Worryingly, OpenAI’s internal tests show GPT-5 ‘hallucinates’ in circa one in 10 responses of the time on certain factual tasks, when connected to the internet. However, without web-browsing access, GPT-5 is wrong in almost 1 in 2 responses, which should be troublesome. Even more worrisome, ‘hallucinations’ may also reflect biases buried within datasets. For instance, an LLM might ‘hallucinate’ crime statistics that align with racial or political biases simply because it has learned from biased data. Of note here is that AI chatbots can be and are actively used to spread misinformation (see here and here). According to recent research, chatbots spread false claims when prompted with questions about controversial news topics 35% of the time — almost double the 18% rate of a year ago (here). AI curates, orders, presents, and censors information, influencing interpretation and debate, while pushing dominant (average or preferred) viewpoints while suppressing alternatives, quietly removing inconvenient facts or making up convenient ones. The key issue is: Who controls the algorithms? Who sets the rules for the tech bros? It is evident that by making it easy to spread “realistic-looking” misinformation and biases and/or suppress critical evidence or argumentation, GenAI does and will have non-negligible societal costs and risks — which have to be counted when assessing its impacts. Building Larger LLMs Is Leading Nowhere The ChatGPT-5 episode raises serious doubts and existential questions about whether the GenAI industry’s core strategy of building ever-larger models on ever-larger data distributions has already hit a wall. Critics, including cognitive scientist Gary Marcus (here and here), have long argued that simply scaling up LLMs will not lead to AGI, and GPT-5’s sorry stumbles do validate those concerns. It is becoming more widely understood that LLMs are not constructed on proper and robust world models, but instead are built to autocomplete, based on sophisticated pattern-matching — which is why, for example, they still cannot even play chess reliably and continue to make mind-boggling errors with startling regularity. My new INET Working Paper discusses three sobering research studies showing that novel ever-larger GenAI models do not become better, but worse, and do not reason, but rather parrot reasoning-like text. To illustrate, a recent paper by scientists at MIT and Harvard shows that even when trained on all of physics, LLMs fail to uncover even the existing generalized and universal physical principles underlying their training data. Specifically, Vafa et al. (2025) note that LLMs that follow a “Kepler-esque” approach: they can successfully predict the next position in a planet’s orbit, but fail to find the underlying explanation of Newton’s Law of Gravity (see here). Instead, they resort to fitting made-up rules, that allow them to successfully predict the planet’s next orbital position, but these models fail to find the force vector at the heart of Newton’s insight. The MIT-Harvard paper is explained in this video. LLMs cannot and do not infer physical laws from their training data. Remarkably, they cannot even identify the relevant information from the internet. Instead, they make it up. Worse, AI bots are incentivized to guess (and give an incorrect response) rather than admit they do not know something. This problem is recognized by researchers from OpenAI in a recent paper. Guessing is rewarded — because, who knows, it might be right. The error is at present uncorrectable. Accordingly, it might well be prudent to think of “Artificial Information” rather than “Artificial Intelligence” when using the acronym AI. The bottom line is straightforward: this is very bad news for anyone hoping that further scaling — building ever larger LLMs — would lead to better outcomes (see also Che 2025). 95% of Generative AI Pilot Projects in Companies Are Failing Corporations had rushed to announce AI investments or claim AI capabilities for their products in the hope of turbocharging their share prices. Then came the news that the AI tools are not doing what they are supposed to do and that people are realizing it (see Ed Zitron). An August 2025 report titled The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025, published by MIT’s NANDA initiative, concludes that 95% of generative AI pilot projects in companies are failing to raise revenue growth. As reported by Fortune, “generic tools like ChatGPT [….] stall in enterprise use since they don’t learn from or adapt to workflows”. Quite. Indeed, firms are backpedaling after cutting hundreds of jobs and replacing these by AI. For instance, Swedish “Buy Burritos Now, Pay Later” Klarna bragged in March 2024 that its AI assistant was doing the work of (laid-off) 700 workers, only to rehire them (sadly, as gig workers) in the summer of 2025 (see here). Other examples include IBM, forced to reemploy staff after laying off about 8,000 workers to implement automation (here). Recent U.S. Census Bureau data by firm size show that AI adoption has been declining among companies with more than 250 employees. MIT economist Daren Acemoglu (2025) predicts rather modest productivity impacts of AI in the next 10 years and warns that some applications of AI may have negative social value. “We’re still going to have journalists, we’re still going to have financial analysts, we’re still going to have HR employees,” Acemoglu says. “It’s going to impact a bunch of office jobs that are about data summary, visual matching, pattern recognition, etc. And those are essentially about 5% of the economy.” Similarly, using two large-scale AI adoption surveys (late 2023 and 2024) covering 11 exposed occupations (25,000 workers in 7,000 workplaces) in Denmark, Anders Humlum and Emilie Vestergaard (2025) show, in a recent NBER Working Paper, that the economic impacts of GenAI adoption are minimal: “AI chatbots have had no significant impact on earnings or recorded hours in any occupation, with confidence intervals ruling out effects larger than 1%. Modest productivity gains (average time savings of 3%), combined with weak wage pass-through, help explain these limited labor market effects.” These findings provide a much-needed reality check for the hyperbole that GenAI is coming for all of our jobs. Reality is not even close. GenAI will not even make tech workers who do the coding redundant, contrary to the prediction by AI enthusiasts. OpenAI researchers have found (in early 2025) that advanced AI models (including GPT-4o and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet) still are no match for human coders. The AI bots failed to grasp how widespread bugs are or to understand their context, leading to solutions that are incorrect or insufficiently comprehensive. Another new study from the nonprofit Model Evaluation and Threat Research (METR) finds that in practice, programmers, using early 2025-AI-tools, are actually slower when using AI assistance tools, spending 19 percent more time when using GenAI than when actively coding by themselves (see here). Programmers spent their time on reviewing AI outputs, prompting AI systems, and correcting AI-generated code. The U.S. Economy at Large Is Hallucinating The disappointing rollout of ChatGPT-5 raises doubts about OpenAI’s ability to build and market consumer products that users are willing to pay for. But the point I want to make is not just about OpenAI: the American AI industry as a whole has been built on the premise that AGI is just around the corner. All that is needed is sufficient “compute”, i.e., millions of Nvidia AI GPUs, enough data centers and sufficient cheap electricity to do the massive statistical pattern mapping needed to generate (a semblance of) “intelligence”. This, in turn, means that “scaling” (investing billions of U.S. dollars in chips and data centers) is the one-and-only way forward — and this is exactly what the tech firms, Silicon Valley venture capitalists and Wall Street financiers are good at: mobilizing and spending funds, this time for “scaling-up” generative AI and building data centers to support all the expected future demand for AI use. During 2024 and 2025, Big Tech firms invested a staggering $750 billion in data centers in cumulative terms and they plan to roll out a cumulative investment of $3 trillion in data centers during 2026-2029 (Thornhill 2025). The so-called “Magnificent 7” (Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) spent more than $100 billion on data centers in the second quarter of 2025; Figure 1 gives the capital expenditures for four of the seven corporations. FIGURE 1 Christopher Mims (2025), https://x.com/mims/status/1951… The surge in corporate investment in “information processing equipment” is huge. According to Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, data center investments’ contribution to (sluggish) real U.S. GDP growth has been the same as consumer spending over the first half of 2025 (Figure 2). Financial investor Paul Kedrosky finds that capital expenditures on AI data centers (in 2025) have passed the peak of telecom spending during the dot-com bubble (of 1995-2000). FIGURE 2 Source: Torsten Sløk (2025). https://www.apolloacademy.com/… Following the AI hype and hyperbole, tech stocks have gone through the roof. The S&P500 Index rose by circa 58% during 2023-2024, driven mostly by the growth of the share prices of the Magnificent Seven. The weighted-average share price of these seven corporations increased by 156% during 2023-2024, while the other 493 firms experienced an average increase in their share prices of just 25%. America’s stock market is largely AI-driven. Nvidia’s shares rose by more than 280% over the past two years amid the exploding demand for its GPUs coming from the AI firms; as one of the most high-profile beneficiaries of the insatiable demand for GenAI, Nvidia now has a market capitalization of more than $4 trillion, which is the highest valuation ever recorded for a publicly traded company. Does this valuation make sense? Nvidia’s price-earnings (P/E) ratio peaked at 234 in July 2023 and has since declined to 47.6 in September 2025 — which is still historically very high (see Figure 3). Nvidia is selling its GPUs to neocloud companies (such as CoreWeave, Lambda, and Nebius), which are funded by credit, from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone and other Wall Street private equity firms, collateralized by the data centers filled with GPUs. In key cases, as explained by Ed Zitron, Nvidia offered the neocloud companies, which are loss making, to buy unsold cloud compute worth billions of U.S. dollars, effectively backstopping its clients — all in the expectation of an AI revolution that still has to arrive. Likewise, the share price of Oracle Corp. (which is not included in the “Magnificent 7”) rose by more than 130% during mid-May and early September 2025 following the announcement of its $300 billion cloud-computing infrastructure deal with OpenAI. Oracle’s P/E ratio shot up to almost 68, which means that financial investors are willing to pay almost $68 for $1 of Oracle’s future earnings. One obvious problem with this deal is that OpenAI doesn’t have $300 billion; the company made a loss of $15 billion during 2023-2025 and is projected to make a further cumulative loss of $28 billion during 2026-2028 (see below). It is unclear and uncertain where OpenAI will get the money from. Ominously, Oracle needs to build the infrastructure for OpenAI before it can collect any revenue. If OpenAI cannot pay for the enormous computing capacity it agreed to buy from Oracle, which seems likely, Oracle will be left with the expensive AI infrastructure, for which it may not be able to find alternative customers, especially once the AI bubble fizzles out. Tech stocks thus are considerably overvalued. Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, warned (in July 2025) that AI stocks are even more overvalued than dot-com stocks were in 1999. In a blogpost, he illustrates how P/E ratios of Nvidia, Microsoft and eight other tech companies are higher than during the dot-com era (see Figure 3). We all remember how the dot-com bubble ended — and hence Sløk is right in sounding the alarm over the apparent market mania, driven by the “Magnificent 7” that are all heavily invested in the AI industry. Big Tech does not buy these data centers and operate them itself; instead the data centers are built by construction companies and then purchased by data center operators who lease them to (say) OpenAI, Meta or Amazon (see here). Wall Street private equity firms such as Blackstone and KKR are investing billions of dollars to buy up these data center operators, using commercial mortgage-backed securities as source funding. Data center real estate is a new, hyped-up asset class that is beginning to dominate financial portfolios. Blackstone calls data centers one of its “highest conviction investments.” Wall Street loves the lease-contracts of data centers which offer long-term stable, predictable income, paid by AAA-rated clients like AWS, Microsoft and Google. Some Cassandras are warning of a potential oversupply of data centers, but given that “the future will be based on GenAI”, what could possibly go wrong? FIGURE 3 Source: Torsten Sløk (2025), https://www.apolloacademy.com/… In a rare moment of frankness, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had it right. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI?” Altman said during a dinner interview with reporters in San Francisco in August. “My opinion is yes.” He also compared today’s AI investment frenzy to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. “Someone’s gonna get burned there, I think,” Altman said. “Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money – we don’t know who …”, but (going by what happened in earlier bubbles) it will most likely not be Altman himself. The question therefore is: How long investors will continue to prop up sky-high valuations of the key firms in the GenAI race remains to be seen. Earnings of the AI industry continue to pale in comparison to the tens of billions of U.S. dollars that are spent on data center growth. According to an upbeat S&P Global research note published in June, 2025 the GenAI market is projected to generate $85 billion in revenue 2029. However, Alphabet, Google, Amazon and Meta together will spend nearly $400 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 alone. At the same time, the AI industry has a combined revenue that is little more than the revenue of the smart-watch industry (Zitron 2025). So, what if GenAI just is not profitable? This question is pertinent in view of the rapidly diminishing returns to the stratospheric capital expenditures on GenAI and data centers and the disappointing user-experience of 95% of firms that adopted AI. One of the largest hedge funds in the world, Florida-based Elliott, told clients that AI is overhyped and Nvidia is in a bubble, adding that many AI products are “never going to be cost-efficient, never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.” “There are few real uses,” it said, other than “summarizing notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding”. It added that it was “skeptical” that Big Tech companies would keep buying the chipmaker’s graphics processing units in such high volumes. Locking billions of U.S. dollars in into AI-focused data centers without a clear exit strategy for these investments in case the AI craze ends, only means that systemic risk in finance and the economy is building. With data-center investments driving U.S. economic growth, the American economy has become dependent on a handful of corporations, which have not yet managed to generate one dollar of profit on the ‘compute’ done by these data center investments. America’s High-Stakes Geopolitical Get Gone Wrong The AI boom (bubble) developed with the support of both major political parties in the U.S. The vision of American firms pushing the AI frontier and reaching GenAI first is widely shared — in fact, there is a bipartisan consensus on how important it is that the U.S. should win the global AI race. America’s industrial capability is critically dependent on a number of potential adversary nation-states, including China. In this context, America’s lead in GenAI is considered to constitute a potential very powerful geopolitical lever: If America manages to get to AGI first, so the analysis goes, it can build up an overwhelming long-term advantage over especially China (see Farrell). That is the reason why Silicon Valley, Wall Street and the Trump administration are doubling down on the “AGI First” strategy. But astute observers highlight the costs and risks of this strategy. Prominently, Eric Schmidt and Selina Xuworry, in the New York Times of August 19, 2025, that “Silicon Valley has grown so enamored with accomplishing this goal [of AGI] that it’s alienating the general public and, worse, bypassing crucial opportunities to use the technology that already exists. In being solely fixated on this objective, our nation risks falling behind China, which is far less concerned with creating A.I. powerful enough to surpass humans and much more focused on using the technology we have now.” Schmidt and Xu are rightly worried. Perhaps the plight of the U.S. economy is captured best by OpenAI’s Sam Altman who fantasizes about putting his data centers in space: “Like, maybe we build a big Dyson sphere around the solar system and say, “Hey, it actually makes no sense to put these on Earth.”” For as long as such ‘hallucinations’ on using solar-collecting satellites to harvest (unlimited) star power continue to convince gullible financial investors, the government and users of the “magic” of AI and the AI industry, the U.S. economy is surely doomed. OpenAI’s Altman boasted that AGI can “discover new science,” because “I think we’ve cracked reasoning in the models,” Clearly Altman doesn’t know how science is done. I have, for instance, done an AI search on a theme I used to be an expert years ago namely the cell-to-cell-movement of viruses in plants. With google AI what you obtain is a rehash of ideas more or less currently known. Very importantly, it comes without caveats, critical thinking and without any real experimental data already obtained with its experimental context. The first thing a researcher has to do is to be very critical on any data obtained before, conscientious that all that data was obtained in certain experimental conditions which very frequently result in situations in which the functioning of things are altered or controlled. In this sense, many research results are artificial artefacts and the results of research are often misleading and needing more checks and controls. I very well remember a congress (in Capetown 2001) about plasmodesmata , structures that bridge and communicate plant cells. Virus cell-to-cell movement was amongst the main issues in this small, very specialized, meeting. In a session dedicated to this issue there was a researcher exposing a vast body of research the lab had been doing using state-of-the-art methodology. This included data already published (several articles) and in the same line of research new data to be published soon with important conclusions. In the same session, a different research group using different state-of-the-art methodologies obtained results which suggested conclusions quite different to those that the first group had reached. There was a very interesting and heated discussion on the matter. It was obvious that one of the researchers had immersed in a rabbit hole of experimental artefacts. You can call it hallucinatory results. So humans can indeed hallucinate sometimes and this is apparently what AI machines are learning top do: hallucinate. Starting any research with the very redacted rehash of ideas without any kind of critical thinking looks to me the exact recipe for hallucinatory AI-driven research. In the same session, a different research group using different state-of-the-art methodologies obtained results which suggested conclusions quite different to those that the first group had reached. There was a very interesting and heated discussion on the matter. It was obvious that one of the researchers had immersed in a rabbit hole of experimental artefacts. You can call it hallucinatory results. So humans can indeed hallucinate sometimes and this is apparently what AI machines are learning top do: hallucinate. You’ve touched upon what AI boosters are hoping for (AGI) and what the limitations of the current state of affairs are and why humans will be sticking around, especially in knowledge generation fields, for some time still. I remember there being some links here on Naked Capitalism that touched on symbolic computation, and how that got discarded for machine learning/statistical approaches in AI, which were highly successful in tackling computer vision/classification problems, and led to a winter in research in symbolic methods, which researchers are slowly rediscovering will be essential for AGI. In this case, symbolic computation would be invaluable for any type of “thinking machine” to simplify contradictory information into abstract logical terms, recognize they form a contradictory set of statements, and then work around that to identify what could be the cause of contradiction, and how it could be resolved, while recognizing a limitation in its own knowledge set to be able to resolve it. Much of scientific research is dedicated to finding and resolving these contradictions. Phenomenon A predicts X happens in some novel set of circumstances. Phenomenon B predicts Y happens in the same novel set of circumstances. Except in pure mathematics, you can’t ‘reason’ your way through whether A and/or B will fail when tested in those novel circumstances. Likewise as you described, testing a phenomenon A in circumstances X and in presumably the same circumstances X’ generated different results. Reasoning can help identify what may caused different results in this instance, but current LLMs aren’t performing this type of reasoning. Anyone who’s knowledgeable in physics would understand these limitations. We’ve dedicated billions of hours of research into trying to reconcile quantum physics with general relativity, an instance of where two theories cannot be reconciled where both gravitational and quantum effects are significant. Much of that research gave us string theory, but string theory itself suffers from a lack of testable and verifiable circumstances, and also has gaps in certain circumstances. As for the life sciences, I’ve seen AI boosters try to remark that LLMs are extremely advanced, since now they’ve begun creating “designer viruses” or “designer gene therapies” that are engineered to achieve certain therapeutic or other effects. However, I’ve been frustrated to try and explain that first, it didn’t actually engineer it, it only proposed it, or “hallucinated it” as you said. Until it actually gets tested or synthesized in a lab, there might be some underlying principle it ignored in its proposal that will prevent synthesizing it. Second, we’ve never actually needed LLMs to do this. Maybe COVID induced brain fog in a lot of people, but October 1st this year marked the 25th anniversary of Folding At Home. Distributed protein folding setups were quite popular, where you could have your computer or game console experiment with trying to find potential new organic compounds by simulating protein dynamics. I’ve bolded potential and simulating there, because finding candidates or isolating certain functionality was only half the battle, experiments were still needed to validate the results or exploit the actual predicted behavior of how those proteins interacted. LLMs suggesting novel genetics are using similar statistical mechanisms to do this, albeit in a less specialized, and thus less accurate and energy efficient way. I have a conspiratorial notion that those pushing forward these massive capital spending sprees know these limitations, and maybe their intention is to turn all of these data centers into biomedical research simulation labs when everyone else catches on that simulating clerical work isn’t that profitable. All of these GPUs and hardware setups are well suited to be adapted into giant protein dynamic simulation clusters. However protein folding doesn’t sound as sexy to Silicon valley investors as replacing human workers. Thank you for your interesting reply Chris. Indeed, computing models are very useful for, for instance, simulating protein dynamics, their folding and changes these undergo under different conditions. There is no human brain that can store all the information available and needed for such simulations. The simulations themselves are to be taken with (tons of) grains of salt. Scientists know that these are just simulations. I think that a big effort has been dedicated to obtain improved versions of RUBISCO, the protein that fixes CO2 to be incorporated in organic material and thought to be the most abundant protein in the world (here an example on Machine Learning to accelerate the process). This kind of work is termed in silico analysis. It isn’t obviously experimental. Whether ML will indeed accelerate the process or make it more complicated it is something that has not been readily shown in this case. It might be that other methods based on random procedures are more efficient and faster. Chris N: I have a conspiratorial notion that those pushing forward these massive capital spending sprees know these limitations, and maybe their intention is to turn all of these data centers into biomedical research simulation labs Of course. That’s exactly what’s happening and biomedical research simulations are one intention. Among others. It’s naive to announce the bleeding obvious, that LLMs can’t hyperscale to more AI or to AGI — whatever that is — as the OP above and many commentators here do as if this were a revelation. Or to point out that LLM-based AI is a bubble. Of course, it is — that’s arguably the business model. The executives running the companies building these giant datacenters almost all went through the dotcom bubble, after all. Ask the next question. (You’re the only person here I’ve seen starting to do that, Chris.) What are they going to do with all that compute besides LLMs? How much compute are we talking about? Currently, the world’s fastest supercomputer is El Capitan, at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, capable of 2.746 exaFLOPS — https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Capitan_(supercomputer). Microsoft is building Fairwater, an AI-focused datecenter in Wisconsin, operational in 2026 that will by comparison supposedly do 17 exaFLOPS and, via massive GPU parallelism, achieve 10x El Capitan’s performance. And this is only one datacenter among others Microsoft is building and which we can presume therefore will get built. (As opposed to speculating, forex, about how much of the Oracle-Softbank-OpenAIStargate effort will come to fruition). So what other kinds of AI architectures can run in such datacenters. Over the next 3 years, here’s some of the roadmap — Large Physics Models (LPMs): Foundation models trained on physics texts, equations, and experimental data, capable of reasoning across scales—from QM to cosmology. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): For modeling relational systems like molecules, social networks, or traffic flows, where entities and their interactions evolve dynamically. Neural PDE Solvers: AI systems that learn to approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), for simulations in fluid dynamics, climate modeling, and fusion energy. Agent-Based Simulation Models (ABMs): These simulate individual decision-makers (humans, cells, vehicles) whose behaviors evolve based on learned rules, for applications in economics, epidemiology, and urban planning. In 3-7 years’ time, the hope/intent is to leverage this massive datacenter compute to develop neuromorphic computing, which will need massively lower energy inputs (i.e. like the human brain). That way, AI can be pushed out the Edge, as it’s now being referred to, with the Edge meaning autonomous cars, robots, etc. Now, how much of this will happen? Well, prediction is hard, especially about the future. But one other factor needs consideration here: we’ve entered a period of geopolitical conflict, unrest, and war, and war generally accelerates technological development — e.g.the state of things pre-WW2 with biplanes and radio to post-WW2, five years later, with jets, rockets, television, and computers. And this is without the climate threat. So, this could a period of greater technological acceleration than we’ve seen in our lifetimes previously. Who’s they? This GPU compute needs to earn some kind of yield that compensates for the risk undertaken by the investors. And it’s only suitable for a handful of very specialized workloads. Who’s going to pay for this cool-sounding science stuff? Capitalists certainly are not altruistic. They can’t do anything like Uber-for-pets with it. Capitalists aren’t altruistic, but they are greedy, and are willing to invest large amounts of money into things if they think they’ll get a return from them, not because they necessarily or actually will get a return from them. In this case T Rowe price, Vanguard, and every other 401k or pension fund manager is basically putting money into this because of the predicted productivity ramifications from it. I.E. worker output is going to double translates to double value generated, translates to double revenue generated, translates to earnings increasing many times over. However, if that doesn’t materialize, and the bubble pops, there will be all of this hardware left over. Even if the hardware is old, it won’t actually be obsolete. I mentioned folding at home, because many of these types of simulations are embarrassingly parallel computational problems, or those where any computer of any power level can contribute towards calculations. Those GPUs will still be useful for anything that requires a lot of matrix multiplication. This means there will be discount sales for a lot of these data centers, providing opportunities for others companies or investors to buy them up for less than what it would have cost to construct them and buy the hardware new. This is the conspiracy that I’m alluding to: Entrepreneurs can’t pitch a use-biochemical-simulations-to-solve-aging start-up because the time horizon is too long, and initial captial cost too risky to convince non-technical investors to pitch in. But if they can convince them to put money into something that they see a return on, and use that to lower the initial capital cost for their own pet project, they’ll go ahead and do that and fund the entire endeavor for either themselves or their associates interested in those ideas after the crash. As a tangentially related thought, Elizabeth Holmes’ former partner is starting up another medical testing and diagnostics company. A lot of people from the Rational/Less-Wrong Sphere, who came up with Effective Altruism and Long-termism, have a deep cult-like interest in trying to overcome death, either by uploading consciousness into machines, or through mastering genetics and developing therapies to reverse aging. If these individuals lacked scruples to defraud investors via cryptocurrency (See Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX), I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re willing to defraud investors because in their moral calculus, raising lifespans to be 10x longer than they are now is worth it, even if some proportion of the population dies from impoverishment from the bubble crashing, because the net result was positive for the survivors. I’ve bolded potential and simulating there, because finding candidates or isolating certain functionality was only half the battle, experiments were still needed to validate the results or exploit the actual predicted behavior of how those proteins interacted. LLMs suggesting novel genetics are using similar statistical mechanisms to do this, albeit in a less specialized, and thus less accurate and energy efficient way. Interesting you mention this, a story in NY Times earlier this week some researchers at OpenAI left to do a startup that takes these kinds of inputs and then claims they’ll have robotic researchers that will actually perform the experimentation itself physically in a lab, presumably a brute force kind of approach to testing. I can only imagine the number of combinations that might need to be tested for any hypothesis. Second, we’ve never actually needed LLMs to do this. Maybe COVID induced brain fog in a lot of people, but October 1st this year marked the 25th anniversary of Folding At Home. Distributed protein folding setups were quite popular, where you could have your computer or game console experiment with trying to find potential new organic compounds by simulating protein dynamics. I believe a similar folding project, AlphaFold, was able to achieve using generative AI/DeepMind what Folding At Home was setting to accomplish; they were awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their achievement. PapP: I believe a similar folding project, AlphaFold, was able to achieve using generative AI/DeepMind what Folding At Home was setting to accomplish Essentially, with some differences. AlphaFold used a transformer architecture to model relationships between amino acids similiarly to how LLMs model word dependencies and has attention mechanisms that work across both sequence and spatial dimensions, similarly to how LLMs track long-range dependencies in text. Differences were no autoregressive token prediction — AlphaFold doesn’t generate sequences, it infers structures — and optimization for protein folding, not open-ended tasks. LLM architectures are pattern-seeking recognition architectures, after all. As Ignacio says above: “There is no human brain that can store all the information available and needed” to work out some biogenetic relationships. Turn an optimized LLM loose on non-semantic data sets and you sometimes get amazing results. ~~ Conversely, giving a free version of ChatGPT semantics-based tasks simply to prove LLMs aren’t really intelligent in order to validate your prior anti-LLM beliefs, as many in the NC commentariat are doing, accomplishes — what? Certainly, it’ll give you the proof that the free LLM system for the masses that you used isn’t intelligent, but just a dumb stochastic pattern-recognition system. But it tells you nothing about what specialized LLMs can achieve at full stretch. So, if you believe it does, who’s the joke on? Because it’s not on the LLM, which is indeed just a dumb stochastic pattern-recognition system. LLM architectures are pattern-seeking recognition architectures, after all. As Ignacio says above: “There is no human brain that can store all the information available and needed” to work out some biogenetic relationships.

This got me thinking about Kurt Gödel and his Numbering System as applied to LLM architecture with regards to patterns/tokens; these are axiomatic systems govern by simple rules woven together into a regression. So if this is the case, then this is an at least formal-like system and will be ultimately be Incomplete even if you account for the largest vocabulary/library of everything ever written (the totality of the Library of Babel from Jorge Borges comes to mind). So is this chase for AGI a fool’s errand if we can’t even prove AGI on a formal level? What does this say about us on a formal level? Maybe we can relate to this other ontological thing as a fellow confused pattern-recognizing being? Not equal but different. Regarding the replacement of journalists i believe that there are some of a kind who can be easily replaced by AI. Those whose work consists on following a script and who are so frequently and sadly found in MSM. AI can probably do it more reliably. In fact they probably use AI tools to write their articles. Nvidia is selling its GPUs to neocloud companies (such as CoreWeave, Lambda, and Nebius), which are funded by credit, from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone and other Wall Street private equity firms, collateralized by the data centers filled with GPUs. I think it’s worth pointing out here that these GPUs go obsolete in 6-12 months, so their value drops sharply. Their collateral is like fresh fish. They have to hold on to it, but it will inevitably make a huge stink. Obsolete does not mean useless. Machines that are not state of the art still work and can perform functions that do not require the latest and greatest hardware. However, in a hyper competitive environment, everyone naturally wants to be at the cutting edge. Obsolete means useless as debt collateral, since the asset loses much of its value. It seems that with computer operating systems software (OS), the free & open source (FOSS) Linux has proven to be superior to non-FOSS/closed OS software like Windows. What are the prospects for FOSS in AI/LLM? Is there a similar likelihood that a FOSS software in AI/LLM like DeepSeek will outperform the US closed competitors like OpenAI? If no AI/LLM software is producing the hyped extreme productivity breakthroughs, wouldn’t there be an incentive globally in most nations to use or make limited propietary modifications on DeepSeek instead of the US closed software alternatives. Especially if it is the case that DeepSeek can provide similar quality models with 10% of Meta’s AI software’s computing power. Any computer scientists or financial analysts/economists focused on the InfoTech sector have a take on how a FOSS software like DeepSeek will influence future AI development? “What are the prospects for FOSS in AI/LLM? Is there a similar likelihood that a FOSS software in AI/LLM like DeepSeek will outperform the US closed competitors like OpenAI?” Sure thing bro, just search for “running deep seek on raspberry pi and you’ll get a long list of how to do it and many examples of it running. Raspberry is a very cheap one board computer that runs linux. https://www.hackster.io/ElecrowOfficial/how-to-run-deepseek-on-a-raspberry-pi-5-step-by-step-guide-c2c790 There’s a big difference between what FOSS can do and what it does do. Mostly the difference between what a motivated individual wants and what a pointy haired boss wants. ProNewerDeal claims Linux is superior (I agree, personally), but that hasn’t budged the needle on desktop market share, has it? Sure, you can shoehorn a LLM onto a Pi (it’ll run like molasses in January), but what CEO is going to boast about that to a quarterly analyst conference call? The CapEx orgy is hype driven, not performance driven (duh). This is an apples / oranges question. The real worry is that the current AI ‘productivity’ hype was a head fake to fund the infrastructure, and the real goal is to get everyone hooked on AI (a la Facebook/TicTok), dumb down the population, grab Google’s advertising money firehose and end up owning the mother of all Big Brother propaganda engines. I recently stumbled into some on-line drama about how the latest OpenAI model was messing with paying customer’s feels, by routing “dangerous or emotional” prompts to a safer model which was heavy on the warnings, and offering up information about self harm hotlines and such, rather than playing along like the previous model. Oh the humanity! I gather that paying customers can select the older model, but there’s real-time “psychological analysis” of your prompts so if it judges that you’re veering into dangerous territory, it routes to a newer, safer model. And let me tell you, THEY DONT LIKE IT! From my 30 minute climb down that rabbit hole, I came to the conclusion that there’s already a lot of people well on their way to the LLM addiction you mentioned in your last paragraph. It may not be plain jane FOSS, but Linux derivatives are being used by the biggest of big boys: Inside Google‘s Data Centers: The Operating Systems Powering Google‘s Global Infrastructure https://expertbeacon.com/inside-googles-data-centers-the-operating-systems-powering-googles-global-infrastructure/ Google‘s servers predominantly run customized versions of the open source Linux operating system that have been tuned and hardened for Google‘s unique technical environment. Rather than rely on standard “off-the-shelf” Linux distributions, Google‘s engineering team has modified and secured the Linux kernel and userspace tools to create server operating systems tailored for massive server fleets running containerized workloads. This journey to create a highly optimized server OS began nearly two decades ago and continues to evolve today. In Google‘s early days in the late 1990s, its initial fleet of servers ran a modified version of the Red Hat Linux distribution. However, as the scale and complexity of Google‘s infrastructure increased, its engineers began customizing the OS to meet its specific technical and operational needs. In 2006, Google started work on “goobuntu”, its own in-house distribution of the Debian-based Ubuntu Linux OS [1]. Goobuntu was used for Google‘s corporate desktops and also some of its production servers. For its larger server fleet, Google hardened and slimmed down the Linux distribution even further, removing extraneous packages and attack surfaces. This more spartan Linux system used an in-house software distribution and management tool called Midas. In the 2010s, Google began migrating servers to its latest generation custom Linux distribution known as gLinux [2]. The article also mentions that Linux derivatives are used by Amazon and Facebook. Admittedly, using a Pi for an LLM is probably not going to work too well, but AMD’s latest high end laptop CPUs are bringing some real heat if you want to do LLM at home: Linux on the New Framework Desktop PC! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziZDzrDI7AM That’s definitely NOT a cheap PC, but the LLM performance is pretty astonishing even at that price point. Overall though, I agree that AI is way, way over hyped for what it’s actually doing. But strangely, AI in other countries (at least one other country) is actually doing some pretty amazing stuff: China’s AI hospitals will transform medicine across the world. But not in the United States. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDmFB7AQSR0 China is already a powerhouse in AI for radiology and medical imaging. Next they’re going global. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RJlqhYt2XQ AI in America strikes me as a “cheat”. American elites don’t have to do the real hard work to compete with a country like China (like re-industrialize, bring back R&D, re-create a skilled middle class workforce) , AI will just figure it all out and “poof”, America is on top again! It’s a nice dream for our elites, but it’s a dream that can turn into a nightmare for the rest of us. Glen: AI in America strikes me as a “cheat”. American elites don’t have to do the real hard work to compete with a country like China (like re-industrialize, bring back R&D, re-create a skilled middle class workforce) , AI will just figure it all out and “poof”, America is on top again! It’s a nice dream for our elites .. that can turn into a nightmare for the rest of us. Yes. The trend is broadly recapitulating nuclear, which American capitalism — where corporate elites had to be served and profit before all else — also screwed up. Also, automobiles. Also, airliners (e.g. current Boeing failures). Don’t quote Silicon Valley at me, because that was built on Pentagon money; in 1960, 100 percent of all microprocessor chips it produced were bought by the DoD for ICBM guidance systems and early-warning radar networks like NORAD; as late as 1967, 75 percent of all chips from Silicon Valley were still going to the DoD. It took the Japanese to pioneer transistor/chip based electronic consumer appliances — computer tech for the civilian masses — not the Americans. Thanks for this excellent article. Indeed, the whole idea that LLMs are going to lead to AGI is just a laughable fantasy. Perhaps if Sam Altman hadn’t dropped out of a comp sci program, he might know this, but he’s from a rich family so he could always retreat back into money and vast carelessness. And then we get to the whole issue of data centers, their costs, the investment bubble, etc. Regarding the question about FOSS alternatives, and alternatives to the big data center apps… One of my colleagues has been experimenting with local LLMs. This colleague is a professional software engineer with decades of experience. Key findings about local LLMs: * Vision detection using an Intel Arc A770 (12GB of ram) works but gives many false positives. * Voice commands work only for the simplest commands. Anything beyond “turn on the kitchen light” fails to translate into expected actions. * Trying to write kubernetes YAML — the results are so terrible it’s just laughable. * Code generated in other languages “utter trash”. * Trying to resolve actual networking problems gives the same few suggestions, all of which were incorrect. * Trying to solve networking problems with cloud-based LLMs isn’t much better. * Using the app for an interactive diary, it got stuck in discussion loops after a few days. * Open source LLMs on Hugging Face are always well behind the commercial offerings from OpenAI et alia. Conclusion: currently-available local LLMs are simply not usable for many problems, or will cost too much to produce better results. From my vantage point, a lot of the hype around generative AI is being sustained by people who stumble through vibe coding a basic app and then say “wow, this is amazing — I wrote an app but I didn’t have to learn to code!” Basically, these are people looking for a free lunch. They want to be able to say “I wrote an app” but they don’t want to make the effort to learn a programming language. There are also those who say they want to learn, but in fact they are unwilling to just sit down and read a book. There are hundreds and hundreds of books about many different programming languages, expressly for this purpose. E.g., once upon a time, I read Kernighan and Ritchie’s The C Programming Language. It’s well-written and not very long. This is the tried and true way of doing it. But vibe coders don’t want to make such an effort. They want to “chat” with an AI to “learn” what they would get from simply reading a book. In other words, they want hold-holding and fawning attention from a sycophantic bot, all the way through. The unspoken premise here is that learning a programming language is some sort of insanely difficult task — but is it really? IMO, this leads us directly to a deeper issue, which is people who expect rewards — or actually feel entitled to those rewards — but don’t want to make any effort to get those rewards. What i found more damning is that while there are indeed applications for which de LLM models can be useful and help humans with some cumbersome tasks the big 7 keep focused on AGI. Interesting but boring business models bypassed in the search for some utopian or dystopian tech control of everything. The bubble is very, very high above us. And agreed: very good article. “…once upon a time, I read…” This is actually the key failing of AI. You read and comprehended something. LLM’s are given information to make statistically inferred outputs. They don’t read nor comprehend the information that was provided to them in training. I have some limited experience with local LLMs. It was like working with a 3 year old… but unlike a 3 year old, it never learned and kept making the same mistakes. Once in a while, I got better results without changing anything, and other times worse. Software engineer here. I can’t add much to this, unless the idea of AI code generation is to change my job from thinking about solutions to business concerns to thinking about editing the AI’s probabilistic solutions to business concerns, is the order of the day. Of course the there has been some big talk, but not many takers yet it seems. Amazon made hay over exactly this not long ago, as if the efficiency gains are something you can now take to the bank, and removed “tens of thousands” of workers from their rolls. But a few months later it turns out they just wanted to hire a bunch of H1b visa holders instead. Turns out AI ‘efficiency gains’ are simply wage cuts: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/amazon-blamed-ai-for-layoffs-then-hired-cheap-h1-b-workers-senators-allege/ “Those aren’t eatin’ sardines, their tradin’ sardines.” *they’re too early in the morning to try to be witty. sardine (n.) : “pilchard, type of small oily fish,” migratory and highly esteemed as a food, early 15c., from Latin sardina, sarda, from late Greek sardinē, sardinos, earlier sardē, which is often said to be from or related to Sardō “Sardinia” (see Sardinia), the Mediterranean island, near which the fish probably were caught and from which they were exported. which takes us back to the previous discussion of Sardonic Laughter. When i was in Cali i didn’t ask for pilchards but sardines and it was better understood by many sellers there. You know what happens with fish names: they are local and you have plenty of regional variations which apply to some similar fish species. If you enter “sardine” in fishbase you obtain 63 entries from many different regions representing more than two dozen species besides Sardina pilchardus. My wife has had a curious experience with AI-driven decisions taken in a Spanish bank. She was being charged some commissions on her account which according to bank rules were not applicable in this account. She went to a branch to get those removed and dis-charged. The person attending her agreed that she was right but when she tried, the AI algorithms didn’t allow to remove the commission because some obscure “original sin”, let’s call it this way, coming from the merger of the original bank where the account had been opened long ago. In the end this has been solved by a helping attendant who decided that the only way to do this was to deceive the algorithm with false data. You can imagine where is this all going when you have to resort to tricks. Sounds like a great way to have a crooked bank employee feed the AI algorithm some dodgy data so that bank funds are sent to an account that may not be “officially” listed. Would banks miss money going into a bank account that they cannot find listed in their files or even know about? That sounds a lot like the begging process that medical professionals face, with insurance company “care approval” protocols. There is no shortage of stories about doctors and patients trying to get timely care coverage. Insurers claim cost savings and better care, but charts suggest otherwise. There is a thingy about this on the Netflix show Barry and is in real life the Australian Robo Debt debacle – https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-04/robodebt-victims-get-compensation-from-class-action/105734030 I mean its not like there is some decades of these machinations in the “Market Place” and some are still confused … HR is old hat now lmmao … This is a tangent, but bear with me – it’s good and kinda relevant. The last link in the article is to a Science News Today article about building a “Dyson Sphere.” The article states: Dyson’s idea was born out of a need to conceptualize how an advanced civilization could continue to thrive as it consumed more and more energy. This is fake news (and a very common misconception). Freeman Dyson was making fun of the tortured logic used by SETI scientists to explain why they thought looking for particular radio waves would be a reasonable way to scan the stars for life. The article in which Dyson proposed the sphere was a one-page parody letter to an astro-physics journal. Unfortunately, a lot of people don’t get dry humor (which is extremely obvious when you read the actual ‘paper’) and took him seriously. Dyson himself thought it was funny that he was best known for a joke he made instead of any of the actual physics he did. At any rate, the fact that a science news website is acting like Dyson Spheres make any sense at all (they don’t, and purposely so) is pretty indicative of where we’re at as a society…i.e. pretty far down the path to Idiocracy. So the guy bringing us GenAI talking about building Dyson Spheres is pretty on-brand. The best part of Altman’s quote got cut out in the article, however. Right after mentioning Dyson spheres, he says, “Like probably in the next 10 years or something.” roflmao. IBM TV ad on streaming: “Blue gonna help you transform your business with AI.” Reminds me of the TQM craze, everyone chased it no one read Deming! It’s doing wonders for their stock price, though. Victory! Why does this whole sorry episode remind me of the Biblical story of The Tower of Babel? It will all end in tears … As of last night, it finally dawned on me that I’ve been noticing what must be AI generated text in the description feeds to my Amazon Prime video account feeds. The first one I saw, but didn’t recognize it at the time as an AI hallucination, was a movie with the description that started something like, “Set in the 1920’s…”. However watching the trailer it was obvious the story was more modern, but the one item that probably threw me was there was one brief photo in the trailer that was older – maybe from the 1920’s. Anyhow I was confused enough by it that I just kept skipping it. Then last night I watch “The Healer”. It’s intro text started something like, “From the 17th century…” but again the trailer was all modern. I mentally just assumed the 17th century was a reference to a family history of healers which was part of the story line (that it was a family thing). However, after watching it there is NEVER any mention of anything from the 17th century. Then it dawned on me that it might be an AI hallucination. When I even went to the Amazon website the descriptive text there for “The Healer” never said anything about the 17th century, it was only in my Amazon Prime feed from the app on my Android TV. I am now certain my confusion over the “Set in the 1920’s” is also a hallucination. For all your readers who are interested in the history of AI’s coming into being in its current form Matteo Pasquinelli’s book, ‘The Eye of the Master: a social history of Artificial Intelligence’ is indepensable. It chartes the battles of the neuroscience sector, the interests of the US navy and Marxist analysis of labour power with formidable argument to demonstrate the deep flaws in AI’s claims to triumphant revolution. Well, with AI replacing labor, AI robotics replacing labor, AI replacing thinking … AI replacing….. with AI getting all the money to be productive while actual humans have income while that income is depleted more and more by out-go. You would think that fewer and fewer people will be able to afford the purchase or consumption of these magical AI fantasies. I guess if humans are to be digitized to the point of no choice, well then, AI will have all the biological imput devices for it’s consumption and outputs designed to maximize profits I am waiting for AI to come of age in law and take over for lawyers and judges. Between the constant stories of AI hallucinations re: legal case, and anecdotes about AIs learning to “cheat,” I can only imagine what sort of dystopic Wild West is coming for the court system… “The disappointing rollout of ChatGPT-5 raises doubts about OpenAI’s ability to build and market consumer products that users are willing to pay for. But the point I want to make is not just about OpenAI: the American AI industry as a whole has been built on the premise that AGI is just around the corner. All that is needed is sufficient “compute”, i.e., millions of Nvidia AI GPUs, enough data centers and sufficient cheap electricity to do the massive statistical pattern mapping needed to generate (a semblance of) “intelligence”. This, in turn, means that “scaling” (investing billions of U.S. dollars in chips and data centers) is the one-and-only way forward — and this is exactly what the tech firms, Silicon Valley venture capitalists and Wall Street financiers are good at: mobilizing and spending funds, this time for “scaling-up” generative AI and building data centers to support all the expected future demand for AI use.” The disappointing performance of the COVID-19 vaccines raises doubts about Biomedicine’s ability to read and understand the scientific literature, which has demonstrated conclusively that durable immunity to coronaviruses is unattainable in vertebrates, either through previous infection or vaccination. Nevertheless, Operation Warp Speed was built on the premise that after everyone was vaccinated the pandemic would recede into nothingness. Cost was no object, and a few transnational Big Pharma corporations made tens of billions of dollars during 2021 and 2022, with the expectation of a continuing money stream after the initial surge in vaccinations. This approach was the only way forward and would lead to a revolution in rapid responses to future emerging infectious diseases using mRNA vaccines. And the scientists who figured out how to stabilize expression of exogenous mRNA in the target cells and tissues were awarded a Nobel Prize for their previously underappreciated research. Some calm reflection is in order. If all progress in AI development stopped cold today, it would take 20 years for its benefits to percolate through the world economy. Note that the productivity potential of networked computer technology and uniform electronic data standards available 20 years ago has still not been achieved, largely because of institutional behavioral inertia. The gating factor in the application of intelligence to the problems of man is not the pace of the synthesis of intelligence, it is the unwillingness of mankind to behave intelligently in accepting change. We know how to make universal medical charts and records. We know how to fully automate air traffic control. We know how to prevent train collisions. We know how to build trusted voting systems. But we are good at finding reasons for not doing the things we say we want to accomplish. Of course, when something becomes an “emergency,” suddenly the obvious is discovered. Welcome to the modern world: powered by emergencies, not emergent technologies. It ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. — Niccolò Machiavelli This IS calm reflection, and not a moment too soon, in the face of too much cult-like marketing hype. Who is this “we” that will harness technology for the good of mankind? If recent history has shown us anything at all, it is that the application of new technologies—at least in the Western world—will be controlled by the most ruthlessly exploitive financial interests and used primarily if not exclusively to extract value from everyone else. This is the opposite of broadbased dissemination and learning that filters into quality improvements across sectors, raising living standards. My sister is a nurse. I’ve heard quite a bit about the rollout and aftermath of the EPIC medical management system. It is not designed to help medical providers or improve patient care. It’s about billing, full stop, and it’s hated by pretty much everyone she knows in her field. “We know how to make universal medical charts and records.” Yes, we do. And they have very little to do with improving healthcare and everything to do with billing and upcoding. No single $8-ibuprofen tablet shall remain unaccounted for! It is also true that AI transcribed charts are often replete with mistranslations and outright hallucinations. It is a sad fact that U.S. hospitals have effectively resisted the automation and interoperability of their systems for decades. Medical professionals have insisted on preserving institutional moats and drawbridges that render their computer systems highly incompatible, despite the obvious need to track the same patient information. There is no digital standard for the patient chart, the most basic medical record. Between 5 to 10 percent of patients are harmed by medical error. Surely uniform AI cross checks on diagnosis and treatment would reduce that. Put on top of this a health insurance structure that only M.C. Escher could depict, and you have an inefficient mess attributable not to evil computer geniuses, but to institutional turf wars, perverse incentives, and just plain cussedness. It’s not just medical institutions. Look at the power grid, the rail system, pipeline infrastructure, and air traffic control. Look at the inability to build housing, the plague of homeless mentally ill people, all in a nation that is among the richest in the world. Is misguided technology speculation really a central problem? Is misguided technology speculation [that will probably crash a debt-ridden economy] really a central problem? It sounds bad to me… Private Debt mate “Is misguided technology speculation really a central problem?” It’s certainly not the solution. Most of this is due to the category error that his health insurance. People insure their lives and property against events that are unlikely. Illness and accident are not in this category. No argument from me that if healthcare were the objective instead of private profit (even in “nonprofit” hospitals), interoperability and legitimate electronic health records could be useful and universal and improve healthcare all around. According to STAT yesterday, UpToDate is unveiling its AI version. UpToDate has become the near universal cheat sheet for clinicians. Still, from the article: That kind of explainability is critical as doctors choose when and how to let different AI tools help them, said Crowe. But healthcare AI experts emphasized that those advances have not eliminated the chance for error through hallucinations, omissions, or other more nuanced LLM mistakes. Stanford’s Chen cited an example in which a resident had treated a patient with severe alcohol withdrawal with phenobarbital, a powerful sedative and anticonvulsant, based on an LLM-based tool’s response. Chen asked the AI the same question, and got the response he expected: First line therapy was safer benzodiazepines, followed by phenobarbital. “AI will just make up some stuff — or even if it doesn’t make up stuff, it’s a little bit random,” he said. “This unpredictability is what allows it to be kind of creative and flexible. But do you want to be creative when you’re practicing medicine?” Some clinical generative AI tools may perform better than others — depending on their engineering, the data they’re trained on, or their underlying LLMs. There are tradeoffs involved in choosing any subset of medical material to train on. “You are potentially missing some important information if you’re not pulling from more up-to-date resources,” said physician Cornelius James, who researches AI and evidence-based medicine at the University of Michigan. “But you also avoid bias in that you’re not pulling from some of those more up-to-date resources.” But clinicians are missing the details needed to make informed choices between tools. “The general state of the evidence is terrible,” said neurosurgeon Eric Oermann, who directs the Health AI Research Lab at NYU Langone. Researchers and companies are developing benchmarks that evaluate an LLM’s medical abilities, from simple early versions like taking the U.S. medical licensing exam to those involving real-world patient tasks and clinical reasoning. Benchmarks are imperfect, said Oermann, but at least they allow for researchers to compare large language models from tech companies like Google and OpenAI on a level playing field by peppering their APIs with thousands of programmed questions. Anyway, I do not think it unreasonable to expect a resident physician to know that benzodiazepines are the preferred choice over phenobarbital for a patient suffering from alcohol withdrawal, which is not a particularly rare condition. It has been said millions times that “being educated means knowing where to look up something.” No, being educated means knowing what you know and what you don’t know. Researchers and companies are developing benchmarks that evaluate an LLM’s medical abilities, from simple early versions like taking the U.S. medical licensing exam to those involving real-world patient tasks and clinical reasoning. GingerBalls on the Twitter often points out that there’s an unintelligent solution to every intelligence test, so passing these licensing exams is meaningless. Participation in the technical aspects of this discussion, which I am reading with great interest, is above my pay grade, but an observation: the medical and pharmaceutical professions, at least in Canada, are currently the sole remaining market for fax machines. You clearly have not been paying attention to our decade+ posting, based on the work of medical professionals who happen to be experts in IT, as well as the experience of users, that electronic health records are an utter train wreck. And it has NADA to do with your bogus depiction. The process has been driven by billing and the desire to upcode. Not medical care. Not ever remotely your fabricated “medical professionals preserving institutional moats’. You need to stop Making Shit Up when you do not know what you are talking about. Agree with everything here except timing. Some economists tried to quantify the technology diffusion rate and found it’s closer to fifty years instead of twenty if you’re looking at full global adoption. Smartphones took over the world and changed our brains in less than ten years, on the other hand. But yes, there are still Homo sap tribes living in the Amazon who don’t know the world outside their forest and are living the way they lived in 20,000 years (though not in the Americas). Personally, I think it’ll be a sad day if and when they cease to be there — because the world is coming for them — though I wouldn’t wish to be one of them. “Yet AI, which Storm calls “Artificial Information” … Perfect. Re: The AI Bubble and the U.S. Economy: How Long Do “Hallucinations” Last? By Servaas Storm Proper descriptive language is critical to the analysis and reworking of human systems. Therefore, being lulled into repeating truisms that are not true undermines the work being undertaken. In the article, Storm says, “The AI investment boom is based on the belief that AI will make workers and firms significantly more productive, which will in turn boost corporate profits to unprecedented levels.” That phrase is not true. Eliminating “workers and” corrects the statement, ironically, by doing exactly what makes AI so attractive to “firms.” The idea that automation makes the residual workforce more productive has always been a lie, a lie that has been encouraged by ownership simply because it has some ability to make that residual workforce proud of the machines that make it “the most productive workforce in human history,” even as the latest machines pick off the remaining laborers, one by one. Dividing amount of production by number of laborers to get ever-rising labor productivity figures is a stupid accounting trick. Dividing production by labor equivalent units (LEU’s – and, yes, this is adapted from containerized shipping) gives away the game. By not defining or measuring LEU’s, it veils the possibility that productivity – given that energy and pollution would necessarily be figured into the cost of each LEU – would be revealed as having heretofore invisible periods of stagnation, even regression. More importantly, defining and measuring LEU’s would eliminate any last trace of simplistically attributing productivity to labor. By dividing measured production between labor and LEU’s, it would make stark the reality that ownership always trumps attribution. Attributed productivity has never given more than a tenuous claim to the profits of production. Labor has always known that. Labor has long been able to project the trend of increasing productivity and has long dreaded that projection: that eventually “labor” would be reduced to a janitor cleaning up after the machines, working for minimum wage, while being attributed trillions in productivity. Ownership matters. Once nourishment and a safe place to live is secured, ideas are the most valuable commodities, yet “intellectual property” is almost an oxymoron. Technique ends up embedded in tools. That is why, where the guilds were strong, possessing the tools of a craftsman, without being a member of the appropriate guild might actually be a crime. Similarly, the Luddites were not so much opposed to advances in technology as they were the embedding of their intellectual property into an array of machines. Truly, the machinists were the first computer programers, and they feasted on converting the deep skills of others into own-able hardware. Now, the programmers are coming for the artists, the scientists, even the C-suites, and the latest generation of programmers might be the last, as intellectual property devours its producers, and is left to eat its own tail. But the last programmer will be attributed a vast productivity. “Eric Schmidt and Selina Xuworry, in the New York Times of August 19, 2025, that “Silicon Valley has grown so enamored with accomplishing this goal [of AGI] that it’s alienating the general public and, worse, bypassing crucial opportunities to use the technology that already exists. In being solely fixated on this objective, our nation risks falling behind China, which is far less concerned with creating A.I. powerful enough to surpass humans and much more focused on using the technology we have now.” That’s some Chinese characteristics that I endorse. The USA business and financial sector is preoccupied with trying to insert rent-seeking middle-men between all the issues that could be addressed now – for and by people in the here and now. The people who have to be healthy, sane, and safe in order to have healthy, sane, and safe people in the future. It’s still just fucking software! What a con! If you are interested in a detailed outline of the progress of AI in the MIC, here is a great substack that explains what is going on in the field where military combat AI is being developed. It focuses on Arizona and New Mexico because the largest combat military training centers in the world are located there. I foresee a great future for AI as the military has unlimited financing for the large corporations dabbing in that field. https://sonoransown.substack.com/p/life-recast I guess this is the terminal phase of the AI bubble, the phase I remember from the dotcom one – if you mention the risks that were mounting by the hour people would yell at you because the objective was to get funding and walk away with all you could in the crash. And in five years somebody buys the infrastructure for pennies on the dollar and turns a profit on porn or whatever. Only a tiny example of odd experience: I was testing duck.ai as my system is too old to host the new programs. I wanted duck.ai to shorten a narrative text by 10, then 20, then 50%. For some internal error it cut it down by 90%, 80% and 50% respectively. This failure repeated. It never came up with versions which would be 10% shorter or 20% than what I had fed it with. Strange. Generally the results with narrative fiction are horrible. What the system is offering (they claim to treat the texts confidential) is either total nonsense or equipped with some sense but solely by coincidence. Containing meaning that has little to do with what I had originally written. This is especially true – and now any programmer should seriously lsiten up – humour or “poetical” formulations. Style in general is overwhelming it. Anything where “tonality” comes into play crashes it . As I said I can´t judge state of the art systems. But unless I tell any AI to reproduce something in the style of say TS Eliot, or Dickens or Austen, it doesn´t know wha to do. It is totally lost and will fail to develope inherent styles of its own. And produce gibberish. Which shouldn´t surprise. At the beginning of the industrial revolution, workers rebelled against the machines. They intuited that if they did not own the machines, the machines would own them. This is also the case with robotics in production, “Who owns the robots?” AI in my thinking is no more than a language and data collecting robot. So, “who owns AI?” We see that financialization and rent-seeking have turned AI research into a mess. By all accounts, researchers in China do not do the same. #DotComBoomBustMemories I had a video chat with one of my younger colleagues at work, and they asked me what similarities if any I see between the dot-com-boom, and this new AI-boom. At first, I thought that the dot-com-boom was really more intense flying-by-the-seat-of-ones-pants-into-the-unknown … but as we talked through it, I realized, that this is potentially far worse. The lemmings from lower Manhattan and the sycophants from the valley of silicon are getting the band back together! Rare moment of clarity from Eric Schmidt there … he’s already made his billions, though, so I can imagine some of the young guns who are lookin’ to get theirs scoffing at his concern. Once again, the odious runaway sewage train (via YouTube) of unicorn valuations looks set to derail and spill sh** everywhere. When the colo-business (via dgtlinfra.com) collapsed after the dot-com-bust, a lot of data-center space in NY/NJ, for example, reverted to office space. The intervening years brought public-cloud to the fore, and now public cloud space is set to expand just like metro datacenter space expanded at the turn of the century. One can only imagine the impact of large AI-specific datacenters being built out in the boonies (where land/tax, water and power are cheaper, ostensibly) only to have them decommissioned and empty when the bust invariably comes. Empty strip mall desert redux, anyone? One of the reasons the tech-bros are focused on “surpassing human intelligence” is because they absolutely loathe labor. The finance bros may seem convinced about AI, but they’re not fully. They want two things: • Proof that AI can generate new revenue streams – this, they have gotten thus far. • Proof that AI can kill jobs – this, they haven’t got (to a satisfactory degree yet), and I think this is what they really, really want. The dumb asses don’t understand how an economy works at all, and are blinded by the dollar signs in their eyes. So, yeah … bubble, bubble, toil and trouble! And if, by some chance, this edifice of irrational exuberance somehow manages to survive, just remember: AI is gonna replace everyone … except VC’s … #natch (via futurism.com). Rare moment of clarity from Eric Schmidt there … he’s already made his billions, though, so I can imagine some of the young guns who are lookin’ to get theirs scoffing at his concern. I don’t have to imagine. I’ve heard them. > I don’t have to imagine. I’ve heard them. Thanks much for the confirmation! I know these types, but don’t share environs often. Sadly, the article did NOT look at AI in China – but was navel-focused. China AI is primarily focused on the factory, where it actually provides quantifiable cost savings. The US AI has been focused on rendering a larger fraction of the population as inessential workers – to use the language of Bender in Futurama – meatbags – consistent with the disdain the oligarchs have for the lumpen population. Karma when the bubble bursts? Computers are supposed to compute. That is their utility 2+2=4,every time maybe boring, but that is all there is. Your email address will not be published.
