Summary: MercadoLibre has great prospects, but it is not necessarily a great investment.
Content: MercadoLibre (MELI -0.27%), the leading e-commerce company in Latin America, has been unstoppable lately. The stock rose more than 50% in the last 12 months alone, bringing its total return to a remarkable 274% in the previous five years.
While existing investors celebrate its outstanding stock performance, potential investors may wonder if they should buy it today to participate in future growth.

MercadoLibre has been executing at a world-class level
There aren't many companies that can grow at high rates for more than two decades. While Amazon may be the most apparent growth company with such a track record, its smaller peer, MercadoLibre, is another company that has achieved that feat. To put it into perspective, the Latin American e-commerce company grew revenue from $5.6 million in 2003 to $14.5 billion in 2023.
While many factors contributed to its success, the company's solid execution over the years has been one of the main drivers. For instance, it started mainly in the e-commerce sector but has, over the years, diversified into other areas like logistics, payments, and lending. Such diversification helps improve customer satisfaction -- they can rely on one trusted platform for multiple services -- and opens up new growth avenues for the company.
Another example of MercadoLibre's remarkable execution is its geographically diversified business empire across Latin America. To achieve that, the tech company must adopt a localized approach to managing its operations since countries within the region have different languages, cultures, and consumer habits. While it takes enormous time and effort, the result has been more than satisfactory as the company is now the top one or two player in most of its operating regions.





Suppose MercadoLibre can continue to execute at this level. In that case, there is a good chance that the company can continue to deliver above-average growth rates for the foreseeable future as it rides the on

Title: This Unstoppable Trend Suggests Costco Wholesale Stock Can Still Soar Higher

Time Published: 20240919T091400
Summary: E-commerce could be a huge opportunity for Costco Wholesale in the years ahead.
Content: A top retail stock to own this year has undoubtedly been Costco Wholesale (COST 0.69%). Its shares are up more than 35% since January as it has been hitting new all-time highs along the way. Not only is it a stable investment given its extremely popular warehouses, but the company has also continually found ways to grow its business.
You might think that with the stock now trading at more than 50 times earnings and the economy potentially heading for a slowdown, shares of Costco Wholesale may be approaching a peak, finally. But there's reason to remain bullish on the stock not just this year but for the long haul, as one area of its business has been booming for a while.

E-commerce sales are a huge opportunity for Costco
When you think of buying something online, odds are you're going to go to either Amazon or Walmart. But Costco has the potential to be a big player in that arena as well. The company doesn't separate its e-commerce sales when reporting quarterly numbers, but it does highlight the growth rate.
And on a monthly basis, the company has consistently been growing online sales by double digits. Below is a table of Costco's comparable sales growth rates this year, by month, looking at both the total company sales and just e-commerce.

In every single month thus far this year, Costco's online business has generated comparable year-over-year revenue growth of around 15% or better. And it has routinely been a top-performing part of the business. The company's logistics business has been a key piece of that puzzle as the company reported that in its most recent quarter, which ended on May 12, deliveries through Costco Logistics increased by 28%.

Title: Is This a Once-in-a-Generation Opportunity to Buy Amazon Stock?

Time Published: 20240919T082002
Summary: Amazon stock dropped after its second-quarter report.
Content: Amazon (AMZN 0.91%) stock has gained a staggering 190,400% over its lifetime. If you would have invested $1,000 when it first went public, you'd have more than $1.9 million today.
That was close to 30 years ago. Could it be that investing in Amazon today is a once-in-a-generation opportunity? Let's see why it could be.
Winners keep on winning
Investors looking for the next big thing can sometimes miss the outstanding opportunity right in front of their eyes. Many a shareholder has regretted selling too soon because a stock had already become a multi-bagger.
Amazon may have already delivered life-changing gains, but it could continue to be a stellar stock to own for the foreseeable future. I qualify that by saying that it would be nearly impossible for it to repeat the same gains it's made until now, but it still has incredible prospects to be a market-beating stock long term.
It's a master of developing new businesses, which is why it's such a sure bet for growth. In the past, it was e-commerce, and then cloud computing. It has become the dominant company by far in both of these areas, with a lead so wide, especially in e-commerce, that it would be difficult to unseat in the near future. Total sales increased 10% year over year in the second quarter, and Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud-computing segment, accelerated to a 19% sales increase. There are plenty of tailwinds for both businesses as well.






Amazon has several smaller businesses that are growing fast, specifically advertising, and today the tailwinds are coming from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. CEO Andy Jassy said, "I don't know if any of us have seen a possibility like this in technology in a really long time, for sure, since the cloud, perhaps since the Internet." Although it's still in its infancy, the generative AI business already has a multi-billion-dollar revenue run rate.
Management sees its advantage in its flexibility. Its feedback suggests that customers are looking for o

Title: Intel's Foundry Finally Has Some Good News. Has the Chipmaker Learned Its Lesson?
URL: https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/18/intel-foundry-good-news-stock-chipmaker/
Time Published: 20240918T170421
Summary: The stock is moving higher, but can the momentum last?
Content: Intel's (INTC 3.31%) stock price collapse at the start of August on news out of its earnings report wasn't a big surprise. The chipmaker had fallen behind after years of operating a money-losing foundry business, while fabless rivals, like Advanced Micro Devices, have gained market share.
Intel has long dominated the PC processor business, but a cultural aversion to risk-taking prevented the company from extending that leading position into other areas. It missed the mobile transition and now seems to be falling behind in artificial intelligence (AI).
The company even lost Apple as a customer for its Macs after Apple experienced several years of frustration with Intel's chip quality and the pace of its development. Apple also saw an opportunity to improve its battery life and switched to using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) as its manufacturing partner because TSMC could make smaller chips.
Intel also passed up potentially game-changing opportunities, including a chance to invest in OpenAI back in 2017. Intel was in talks to take a 15% stake in the company for $1 billion. But then-CEO Bob Swan said he was skeptical that generative AI models would make it to market soon enough to repay Intel's investment and didn't close the deal. It was just the kind of short-sightedness and poor judgment that has plagued the company these past few years.
Similarly, SoftBank, the Japanese mega-investor that's funded everything from Uber Technologies to Arm Holdings, held talks with Intel about making an AI chip that would compete with Nvidia. Those talks broke down after Intel couldn't meet Softbank's requirements. That, again, is evidence of a familiar pattern of Intel's products not meeting standards.





The Intel bulls have been a bit desperate for some good news to counter all the negativity for some time now. They recently got some in the form of two new announcements about Intel's foundry division. The news sparked a 9.2% jump in the stock price over two days (Sep

Time Published: 20240918T133000
Summary: The energy drink company's stock has fallen precipitously lately.
Content: It can be difficult to think dispassionately about your stock investments. After all, it's your hard-earned money at stake.
But investors need to take a step back and analyze a company's fundamental prospects when they are considering buying or selling its shares. This approach can help you avoid getting swayed by considerations such as the news reports or short-term stock price swings.
Investors could certainly benefit by taking that approach with Celsius Holdings (CELH -2.64%). Earlier this year, its stock price approached an all-time high of nearly $100. Since then, the shares have fallen by about 64%.
Does this represent a warning signal or a buying opportunity?

Image source: Getty Images.

Fast but slowing top-line growth
Celsius, founded in 2004, makes and sells energy drinks. The company markets its highly caffeinated products as fitness drinks, featuring ingredients such as green tea and ginger, and minimizing artificial ingredients. 





Customers have been receptive, and sales have grown quickly. The company inked a domestic distribution agreement with PepsiCo in 2022 that they expanded to Canada late last year.
Celsius brought in $1.6 million in revenue in 2007; by last year, its top line had grown to $1.3 billion with earnings of $0.79 per diluted share. And from 2022 to 2023, with the help of the PepsiCo deal, the top line doubled. 
Opportunities and challenges
While its growth has slowed in 2024, second-quarter revenue still increased a healthy 23% year over year to $402 million, and earnings increased 65% to $0.28 per diluted share. Celsius' share of the energy drink market had expanded by 1.4 percentage points to 11% as of mid-July. 
Management has also been working on expanding the brand's footprint internationally, and early results have been promising. International sales grew 30% in the latest quarter as it began sales in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. Management expects to launch the brand in Australia, New Zealand, and France this y

Title: Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 1 Year?

Time Published: 20240918T111500
Summary: There are a lot of factors that could influence Nvidia stock over the next year.
Content: It's no secret that excitement surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) has helped propel technology stocks, and the entire market, to new highs over the last year. It's also no secret that semiconductor stock Nvidia (NVDA -1.59%) has witnessed unparalleled buying activity -- so much so, that it's now the third most valuable company in the world as measured by market cap.
But with shares soaring 140% so far in 2024 and 160% over the last 12 months, could Nvidia stock possibly be headed even higher?
Below, I'll explore some factors that could support the ideas of Nvidia stock moving both higher or lower over the next year. Let's dig into the full picture and assess what could influence Nvidia's price action. I'll make my final case for where I see Nvidia stock landing one year from now.

Nvidia stock could be headed higher, but...
Over the last couple of years, one of the biggest catalysts for semiconductor companies is demand for graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs are an integral component for training large language models (LLMs) and myriad machine learning applications.
As it stands today, Nvidia is widely perceived as developing the best GPUs on the market. Its hardware roster featuring H100 and A100 chips is used by some of the largest companies in the world. Furthermore, Nvidia's next-generation GPUs, the Blackwell series, are finally set to hit the market following a brief setback due to a design flaw.





During Nvidia's second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call, CFO Colette Kress said, "Demand for Blackwell platforms is well above supply, and we expect this to continue into next year."
Kress said that Blackwell should generate "several billion dollars" of revenue during the fourth quarter. Considering the robust demand levels for Blackwell, I think it's reasonable to think that the bulk of these revenue tailwinds will trickle into fiscal 2026 (calendar year 2025).
As a result, I would not be surprised at all to see Nvidia stock experience some revived bu

Title: These 2 Dow Stocks Are Set to Soar in 2024 and Beyond

Time Published: 20240918T100500
Summary: These top stocks have plenty of growth catalysts.
Content: The Dow Jones Industrial Average tracks the performance of 30 blue chip stocks. The index has returned 10% year to date, but companies making big splashes in artificial intelligence (AI) could fare much better over the next year and beyond.
Here are two Dow stocks to buy right now.
1. Amazon
Amazon (AMZN 0.91%) stock has delivered wealth-building returns for shareholders over the last few decades, and it's currently up 22% in 2024. Amazon still has plenty of growth opportunities in retail and enterprise cloud services to fuel the stock higher.

Amazon's expanding same-day delivery and growing selection of items will be important advantages in capturing a growing share of the global e-commerce market. Data and intelligence platform Statista predicts that online retail spending will surpass $8 trillion by 2027.
What makes the stock particularly attractive right now is the company's improving profit margin. Operating income nearly doubled in the second quarter over the year-ago quarter, and there are still several opportunities to improve retail margins further, including decreasing transportation costs by getting closer to customers with more same-day delivery facilities.





Meanwhile, Amazon's cloud service business, which generates two-thirds of the company's operating income, is showing even greater growth potential. Companies are migrating their data from on-premises servers to Amazon Web Services to take advantage of tools like Amazon Bedrock, which helps companies build their own AI applications. Amazon also offers custom AI chips that offer better price performance than higher-priced chips from top hardware supplier Nvidia. These are a few of the reasons why AWS' revenue growth accelerated in Q2 to 19% over the year-ago quarter.
The opportunities in online commerce and cloud services are great reasons to consider buying Amazon shares in 2024. Analysts expect Amazon's earnings to grow at double-digit rates in the coming years, and that points to more new highs

Summary: Visa stock is rallying in lockstep with the broader payment processing industry.
Content: After selling off this past summer, Dow Jones Industrial Average component Visa (V -0.17%) has rallied almost 10% during the past month. Here's why the financial stock just reached a new all-time high and has the potential to keep going.
A numbers game
Visa generates revenue every time one of its debit or credit cards is swiped, tapped, or processed on mobile, desktop, or in person. The company's fee structure allows it to benefit from both the frequency and volume of transactions. The company also has a growing international business, which has allowed travelers to process transactions securely and avoid manually converting currencies. 

Image source: Getty Images.

Visa's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is almost 31, which is lower than its median P/E during the past three, five, seven, and 10 years.

V PE Ratio data by YCharts.
Add it all up, and Visa is a great value, even after its recent run-up.





Visa is a "safe" stock
Unlike other growth stocks that are priced for perfection, Visa's earning can continue growing at a high-single-digit to low-double-digit percentage pace, thanks to the benefits of network effects and its growing global reach. It doesn't depend heavily on economic cycles or strength in a particular end market or industry.
This is a particularly compelling advantage, compared to cyclical sectors. For example, if artificial intelligence (AI) spending slows, it could cause a major downturn across the semiconductor industry. If economic growth slows, cyclical industrial or consumer discretionary companies can get hit hard. If oil prices take a hit, oil and gas companies may see slowing or even negative profits.
Granted, some companies are much better positioned to handle cyclical slowdowns, even in vulnerable industries. But Visa is in a different category. It has proven that its earnings can steadily grow even amid inflation, higher interest rates, or recession fears.
Perhaps most impressive is the stock's relative lack of volatility. During the

Summary: Wall Street's smartest and richest money managers are casting aside shares of Nvidia in favor of two other members of the "Magnificent Seven." ...
Content: Investors are rarely at a loss for important data releases on Wall Street. Monthly economic reports highlighting jobs data and the prevailing rate of inflation, coupled with roughly six weeks crammed full of earnings reports from thousands of publicly traded companies, have the potential to overwhelm investors and allow key announcements to slide under the radar.
In mid-August, one of these important announcements may have gone unnoticed.
On Aug. 14, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management filed Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a concise, under-the-hood look at what Wall Street's smartest money managers purchased and sold in the latest quarter (in this instance, the June-ended quarter). In other words, 13Fs clue investors into which stocks, industries, sectors, and trends have been piquing the interest of Wall Street's top asset managers.

The second quarter was a particularly active period for billionaire money managers. Although artificial intelligence (AI) has been making waves on Wall Street, billionaire investors were clear sellers of AI darling Nvidia (NVDA -1.59%), and big-time buyers of two other trillion-dollar stocks.
Billionaire money managers gave Nvidia the boot for a third consecutive quarter
Selling shares of Nvidia is nothing new for Wall Street's brightest and richest investors. The latest quarter marked the third straight quarter that more than a half-dozen prominent billionaire investors had reduced their stakes in Wall Street's leading AI stock. The seven billionaire sellers in the second quarter include (total shares sold in parenthesis):

Time Published: 20240917T170815
Summary: Intel scored a new deal with Amazon.
Content: After hanging on the ropes for much of August and September, Intel (INTC 3.31%) is suddenly having a banner week.
The stock jumped yesterday after the company secured $3 billion in funding from the CHIPS Act, and today it's climbing again after it announced a new partnership with Amazon (AMZN 0.91%). 
At 12:23 p.m. ET, the stock was up 4.4% on the news. Investors see it as a sign that the company is reinventing itself after announcing a massive restructuring in its second-quarter earnings report.

Image source: Getty Images.

What's happening with Intel and Amazon
After the market closed yesterday, Intel said it was expanding its strategic collaboration with Amazon Web Services, announcing a multiyear, multibillion-dollar partnership for Intel to produce custom chips for Amazon, including an artificial intelligence (AI) fabric chip and a Xeon 6 chip designed to handle computing-intensive AI workloads. 
The news gives Intel's foundry business a much-needed win. It's been losing billions of dollars a year and has fallen behind rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor.





The AI fabric chip will use Intel's 18A process, which makes nodes as small as 18 angstroms (1.8 nanometers).

What it means for Intel
Coming directly on the heels of the CHIPS news, the expanded partnership with Amazon is another significant win for Intel Foundry.
However, investors shouldn't get carried with Intel's rally. The company still needs to execute and do so in a timely, cost-efficient manner, which has been a problem for it in the past.
Intel certainly isn't going away, and a vast ecosystem depends on and supports its chip design and foundry businesses, but a turnaround will take a lot more than back-to-back favorable announcements.





Keep your eye on its next earnings report, due out around the end of October. While the numbers will likely be ugly, the company could give some insights into the progress it's making in revamping the business.

Time Published: 20240917T162223
Summary: Another bull lines up behind Shopify.
Content: Shopify (SHOP 0.05%) has long put up enviable growth numbers, but its valuation has historically made the stock volatile.
The e-commerce software leader continues to trade at a high valuation, acting like a battleground stock at times as investors speculate on how long its rapid growth will continue, especially after its plan to expand into logistics through the Deliverr acquisition backfired.
However, Shopify impressed investors with its latest earnings report in August, and now another Wall Street analyst is lining up behind the stock.

Image source: Getty Images.

Shopify's going to $99?
Redburn Atlantic upgraded Shopify stock on Tuesday morning from neutral to buy. 
The firm noted the company's leading integrations across social media and other platforms where businesses advertise and consumers shop, in addition to the increasing functionality of the Shop Pay button.





It expects the company to continue to grow as it capitalizes on Gen Z's online spending. It gave the stock a price target of $99, implying 33% upside.

Is Shopify a buy at $74?
Shopify is the clear leader in e-commerce software, having defended itself against the likes of BigCommerce, Amazon, and Square (which has since rebranded as Block), and it continues to find new ways to grow even as its gross merchandise volume makes it one of the biggest retail platforms in the world.
Shopify reported 21% revenue growth in the second quarter, and its free cash flow margin more than doubled to 16%. 
The company is now profitable according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but on an adjusted basis, it still trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 76. 





Shopify's competitive advantage gives the stock long-term upside, but getting to $99 in the next year seems like a tall order even as the business is executing. Shopify still looks like a buy, but the current valuation should temper expectations.

Title: PDD Holdings Stock Is Beaten Down Now, but It Could 10x

Time Published: 20240917T133000
Summary: The Chinese e-commerce leader's pullback could be a great buying opportunity.
Content: PDD's (PDD -0.08%) stock closed at a record high of $202.82 on Feb. 17, 2021. That represented a 10-bagger gain from its IPO price of $19 on July 26, 2018. The bulls were impressed by the Chinese e-commerce leader's explosive growth rates, and the temporary buying frenzy in hyper-growth stocks amplified its gains.
But today, PDD trades at about $95. It shed over half of its value as its growth cooled and rising rates compressed its valuations. Escalating tensions between the U.S. and China also drove many U.S. investors away from Chinese stocks. However, I believe PDD still has a shot at delivering another 10-bagger gain over the next decade.

How PDD differs from Alibaba and JD
PDD was founded only nine years ago, but it quickly expanded and became China's third-largest e-commerce company after Alibaba (BABA -0.23%) and JD.com (JD -0.66%). PDD's initial growth spurt was driven by China's lower-income shoppers in its lower-tier cities. It generally sold cheaper products than Alibaba and JD, and it encouraged its shoppers to team up across social media networks to score big bulk discounts.
PDD subsequently launched a farm-to-table platform that allowed China's farmers to directly sell their fresh produce to consumers at lower prices. That strategy disrupted traditional grocers and turned PDD into China's largest online agricultural platform. Alibaba and JD only operate traditional brick-and-mortar supermarkets.

In 2022, PDD expanded overseas with Temu, a cross-border marketplace that connected its Chinese merchants with overseas buyers. It's now one of the world's most popular e-commerce apps with more than 167 million monthly active users (MAUs) worldwide, and 50 million of its MAUs are in the United States. Alibaba operates a similar cross-border marketplace called AliExpress, but JD's cross-border marketplace only connects overseas sellers to Chinese buyers.





PDD initially sold its products through first-party and third-party chan

Time Published: 20240917T094600
Summary: Both of these players are leaders in their fields.
Content: Can you become a millionaire by investing in stocks? Absolutely. But there are a couple of key rules to follow. It's important to diversify your investments across a broad range of solid companies, and it's key to invest for the long term. You'll have a much better chance of reaching your goal if you hold on to quality stocks for a period of 10 years or longer than if you bail out after a few weeks or months.
Of course, it's possible that even by following these guidelines you won't pocket millions -- but there's a very strong likelihood you'll still find yourself in a fantastic financial position down the road if you choose wisely now and stick with investing for the long haul.
Today, a great way to offer your portfolio a boost or get started with a bang if you're new to investing is to buy a couple of leading technology stocks that are likely to continue their leadership well into the future. I'm thinking of two with terrific earnings and share performance track records, and plenty of potential ahead. These two players won't do the job alone -- but it's unlikely that any one stock will make you a millionaire unless you invest a tremendous amount in just that player. And that's much too risky. These top tech stocks could help make you a millionaire, though. Let's find out more.

1. Amazon
Amazon (AMZN 0.91%) is one of my favorite tech stocks because of its diversification and leadership in two high-growth areas. The company dominates in both e-commerce and cloud computing. On top of this, Amazon also is on the road to becoming one of the biggest winners in the hot growth area of artificial intelligence (AI).
In e-commerce, Amazon's Prime subscription program and focus on keeping prices low and delivery fast should help it stay ahead. Annual sales events such as Prime Day help the company bring in new members -- and the member retention rate is high. Over the first three months of 2023, 99% of Prime members renewed their memberships for

Time Published: 20240917T070600
Summary: Third Point is heavily invested in Amazon, Microsoft, and Taiwan Semiconductor.
Content: Dan Loeb is the founder and CEO of Third Point, an institutional asset manager whose flagship Offshore Fund has returned 13.1% annually since its inception in 1996. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC -0.19%) has returned 9.4% annually during the same period.
Loeb is "one of the most successful hedge fund managers of his generation," according to The Wall Street Journal. And while Third Point underperformed in 2022 and 2023, its long-term outperformance makes Loeb a good case study for investors.
Loeb has compared artificial intelligence (AI) to disruptive technologies like the internet and smartphones, and AI a prevalent theme in his investments. Somewhat surprisingly, Third Point does not have a position in Nvidia, but it did have 23.1% of $8.7 billion portfolio invested in three AI stocks as of June:

Amazon (AMZN 0.91%): 11%
Microsoft (MSFT -0.78%): 8.1%
Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM -1.21%): 4%.

Here's what investors should know.

Amazon: 11% of Dan Loeb's portfolio
Amazon operates the largest e-commerce marketplace in North America and Western Europe. The company has used the scope of its retail business to secure a strong presence in digital advertising. But its greatest opportunity to make money on artificial intelligence (AI) lies in its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS).





AWS is the leader in cloud infrastructure and platform services, and its market share increased one percentage point between the first and second quarters of 2024. That scale means AWS is uniquely positioned to benefit from AI simply because it already has such a large customer base, and they are more likely to lean on AWS for AI services when/if the need arises as opposed to working with a new cloud provider.
AWS has also extended its ability to monetize AI with new products like coding assistant Amazon Q and generative AI development platform Amazon Bedrock. CEO Andy Jassy recently told analysts, "Our AI business continues to grow dramatically with a multibillion-dollar rev

Title: Why CrowdStrike Stock Was Climbing Today
URL: https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/20/why-crowdstrike-stock-was-climbing-today/
Time Published: 20240920T160834
Summary: Positive commentary from Wall Street helped lift the stock.
Content: Shares of CrowdStrike (CRWD 8.10%) were moving higher today after the company got a bullish analyst note from Citigroup. The analyst built on earlier Wall Street comments that the company seems to have escaped the worst of the backlash that followed its July incident when a faulty software update shut down flights and banking operations, and disrupted other industries.
As of 11:11 a.m. ET, CrowdStrike stock was up 4.5% on the news.

Image source: Getty Images.

Wall Street thinks the worst is behind CrowdStrike
This morning, Citi was the latest Wall Street firm to issue a bullish rating on the stock following the Fal.Con conference earlier this week. Citi commended management's transparency on the earlier software update debacle and cited evidence of customer resilience, noting churn is lower than expected and the cybersecurity company has done a good job of maintaining its pricing. 
Citi reiterated a buy rating on CrowdStrike with a $300 price target. While that implies just a 4% rise in the stock, the note is clearly a positive as CrowdStrike is still trading below where it was before the incident happened.
Earlier in the week, a number of other research firms, including DA Davidson, Evercore ISI, Jefferies, and Truist all reiterated buy ratings on the stock and said the customer backlash following the software incident had largely passed.






Can CrowdStrike keep gaining?
It's certainly a good sign that CrowdStrike has survived the worst of the incident, but the stock is still expensive and growth was slowing prior to the outage.
If the company is truly back on track, the stock should move higher, but investors should be mindful of the valuation as its price-to-sales ratio was 20. Expect the volatility in the stock to continue.

Summary: The cybersecurity stock has been in recovery mode of late, but can it sustain its momentum for the next year?
Content: Shares of CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD 8.10%) have delivered healthy gains of 56% in the past year. But a closer look at the recent stock price action makes it clear that the high-flying cybersecurity company's rally has come to a screeching halt, thanks to a faulty software update that knocked down many global IT systems on July 19.
More specifically, CrowdStrike stock is down 34% from the 52-week highs it hit in early July. However, the cybersecurity specialist has witnessed a recovery recently. Its fiscal 2025 second-quarter results (for the three months ended July 31) seem to have eased investors' concerns about the fallout of the outage.

Does this mean investors should consider buying CrowdStrike stock now following its recent pullback, in anticipation of more gains in the coming year? Let's find out.
Wall Street seems to be bullish about CrowdStrike stock
Out of 51 analysts covering CrowdStrike stock, 82% rate it as a buy, while only 2% rate it as a sell. It's also worth noting that the stock has a 12-month median price target of $315, which points toward a 21% jump in its shares from current levels. The Street-high price target of $540 suggests that CrowdStrike could jump an impressive 108% from current levels.
The bullish analyst outlook despite the global IT outage a couple of months ago -- which reportedly led to a massive loss of $5.4 billion at Fortune 500 companies, according to cloud monitoring and insurance services provider Parametrix -- stems from the company's modest guidance cut. CrowdStrike has reduced its fiscal 2025 revenue guidance to a range of $3.89 billion to $3.9 billion, down from the earlier range of $3.98 billion to $4.01 billion. That translates into a reduction of 2.5% at the midpoint.





The updated guidance means that CrowdStrike's top line is on track to grow 27.5% in the current fiscal year. Management pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that the compensation packages to make up for the outage would affect its subs

Time Published: 20240918T090500
Summary: The stock has climbed in the triple digits over five years.
Content: Until July, shares of CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD 8.10%) were flying high, having gained more than 50% since the start of the year. And that was part of a triple-digit increase over the past five years. That's as the company wowed existing customers and potential ones with its platform powered by artificial intelligence (AI) to protect their businesses from cyberattacks.
In fact, CrowdStrike has become such a cybersecurity powerhouse that when the company launched a faulty software update in July, the world seemed to screech to a halt. Airlines, hospitals, and other businesses across sectors faced blue screens and couldn't continue with their daily operations.
It launched a fix within about an hour, but some customers took weeks to recover. And the outage could have cost Fortune 500 companies more than $5 billion, according to insurance firm Parametrix.
Following this outage -- which experts call the world's biggest ever -- investors fled CrowdStrike stock, worried about the impending impact. But now, some major news from CrowdStrike offers us an encouraging clue about how this might affect the cybersecurity provider in the coming months.

CrowdStrike's Falcon platform
First, a few details about CrowdStrike's cybersecurity platform, Falcon, which gathers data from across an enterprise and beyond in order to determine potential threats. Customers can choose among 28 modules according to their specific security needs. And a significant number of customers have signed on for several, with adoption rates for five or more modules at 65% in the recent quarter.





All of this has helped earnings to soar. For example, in the recent quarter, ended about two weeks after the July outage, the company reported a 32% increase in annual recurring revenue, a subscription gross margin of 78% under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and record operating cash flow and free cash flow. On top of this, CrowdStrike has more than $4 billion in ca

(NASDAQ: ZS), the leader in cloud security, today announced a new set of AI and Zero Trust integrations with the CrowdStrike Falcon® cybersecurity platform to advance security operations. The latest integrations with Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange™ Platform, Zscaler Data Fabric for Security, and CrowdStrike Falcon® Next-Gen SIEM modernize security operations to provide advanced threat detection, response, and risk management. Security operations center (SOC) teams are under constant pressure to assess and manage risks, detect threats early, and respond swiftly to security incidents–all while facing an increasingly complex threat landscape. Siloed security data streams from disparate sources and arbitrary risk assessment mechanisms across diverse environments create operational inefficiencies and delay response times that increase an organization’s cybersecurity risks and possibility of a breach. “Zscaler’s latest integrations with CrowdStrike represent a significant step forward in our collective mission to ease day-to-day work streams for IT security and SOC teams,” said Punit Minocha, EVP of Business Development and Corporate Strategy, Zscaler. “Together, we can deliver a synergistic approach to risk management, threat detection, and policy enforcement.” “To defeat today’s threats, organizations must transform the SOC by harnessing the power of AI and automation to eliminate blind spots and stop adversaries,” said Daniel Bernard, chief business officer at CrowdStrike. “CrowdStrike’s partnership with Zscaler is a critical step in advancing zero trust enforcement, empowering organizations to transform their SOC, closing the gap between security and IT operations.” The latest collaboration between Zscaler and CrowdStrike delivers: Coordinated Threat Sharing, Detection and Response: Through the Falcon Foundry for Zscaler app, which serves as a foundation for Zscaler’s int

Title: Here's What Delta Air Lines Big News Means to Investors
URL: https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/17/heres-what-delta-air-lines-big-news-means-to-inves/
Time Published: 20240917T111000
Summary: The headline numbers were mixed, but management's commentary on industry dynamics was bullish.
Content: The devil is in the details. Despite some mixed-headline numbers from Delta Air Lines' (DAL -0.40%) latest investor update, one aspect of management's commentary is bullish for the company and much of the industry. Here's an unpacking of what management says and why you can feel more comfortable holding the stock afterward.
Mixed-headline numbers
For those investors unaware of summer events, airlines suffered flight delays and cancellations due to a CrowdStrike software update that crashed Microsoft operating systems. Delta Air Lines was particularly badly hit, impacting its revenue and earnings lines.

Investors need to account for the impact (hopefully, a one-off issue) when gauging the company's third-quarter performance and full-year guidance. In doing so, it's clear that two of the three key-operating metrics the airline guides toward align with prior guidance; but one, cost-per-available seat mile (CASM-Ex) adjusted for fuel, is slightly disappointing.
The table below shows that the midpoint of the implied guidance excluding CrowdStrike (fourth column) is 3%, the same as the guidance given in the Q2 earnings presentations. Similarly, implied guidance excluding CrowdStrike is similar for available seat miles.
However, the implied guidance for CASM-Ex is higher than the prior estimate. While a difference of 2.5% compared to 1% to 2% may not appear to be a big deal, it's a closely followed number in the industry, and increasing CASM-Ex will decrease profit margins.

That's one reason the stock sold off initially after the recent trading update on the Morgan Stanley Laguna Conference. The other reason is that management told investors that its full-year earnings per share would be at the midpoint or above the initial guidance of $6 to $7 when excluding the $0.45 impact from CrowdStrike.
On balance, guidance for underlying earnings at the midpoint of prior guidance, but with costs (CASM-Ex) rising more than expected, is a slight ov

Title: Uh-Oh! Alphabet Is Selling Its Stake in 2 Historically High-Flying Artificial Intelligence  ( AI )  Stocks

Time Published: 20240917T090600
Summary: These once-sizable artificial intelligence (AI) holdings for Google parent Alphabet have been paired down big-time over the last two quarters.
Content: Five weeks ago, what can arguably be described as the most important data release of the third-quarter occurred -- and I'm not talking about the July inflation report.
No later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter (Aug. 14 in the latest instance), institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a clear-cut rundown of which stocks Wall Street's brightest, and often richest, investors bought and sold in the latest quarter. Even though these snapshots are up to 45 days old when filed, it offers invaluable insight into the stocks, industries, sectors, and trends have the attention of money managers.

However, 13F filings are a necessity for more than just investment institutions. Some of Wall Street's largest and most-successful companies hold sizable stakes in other businesses, including Nvidia, and are required to file a 13F on a quarterly basis.
One such company, which has nearly $2 billion invested across 42 stocks, is Alphabet (GOOGL 0.89%) (GOOG 0.86%), the parent of search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and autonomous ride-hailing service Waymo, among other ventures.
Alphabet is a search engine juggernaut... and much more!
Most investors are familiar with Alphabet because of its world-leading Google search engine.





In August, Google accounted for a mammoth 90.48% share of worldwide search, per GlobalStats. In fact, Google has held at least a 90% monthly share of global internet search dating back more than nine years. This makes it the undisputed go-to for businesses wanting to target users with their message(s) and affords parent Alphabet unbelievable ad-pricing power.

Time Published: 20240920T210000
Summary: Nvidia has built a solid position for itself in this fast-growing data center niche that could help generate sizable revenue for the company in the long run.
Content: Graphics processing units (GPUs) have been Nvidia's (NVDA -1.59%) bread-and-butter business for a long, long time. The company initially made its name producing GPUs meant for deployment in personal computers (PCs) for gaming and content creation, before eventually striking gold with its data center GPUs that are now in red-hot demand thanks to artificial intelligence (AI).
As it turns out, data center compute chips now produce the majority of Nvidia's revenue. The company sold $22.6 billion worth of data center GPUs in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (which ended on July 28). The segment's revenue shot up 162% year over year, accounting for 75% of the company's top line. However, there is another niche within the data center business where Nvidia is now gaining impressive traction.
This particular business segment is now bigger than Nvidia's gaming business, and it could turn out to be a key growth driver for the company in the long run. Here's a closer look at this emerging business that could supercharge Nvidia's growth.

Nvidia is making terrific progress in this $80 billion market
Nvidia sells two types of data center chips. The first are the GPUs, which are already generating several billion dollars in revenue for the company each quarter. The second type of Nvidia's data center chips is its networking chips, which are also selling like hotcakes as the company's latest quarterly results show.
Nvidia sold $3.7 billion worth of networking chips in the previous quarter, up 114% from the same quarter last year. The company's networking revenue in the first half of the fiscal year stood at $6.8 billion, translating into an annual revenue run rate of nearly $14 billion. The global data center networking market is estimated to generate $37.6 billion in revenue this year. If Nvidia indeed ends fiscal 2025 with $14 billion in data center networking revenue, it would end up controlling 37% of this market.





What's worth noting here is that Nvidia is reportedly grow

Title: Intel Is Turning Its Foundry Business Into a Subsidiary. Time to Buy?

Time Published: 20240920T172900
Summary: Investors should take a closer look at the chipmaker after its latest strategic pivot.
Content: The brutal sell-off in Intel (INTC 3.31%) stock may finally be over. The stock seems to have resurged on news that the company plans to turn its foundry business into a subsidiary. It also expanded its deal with Amazon, inking a new agreement to produce artificial intelligence (AI) chips for Amazon Web Services (AWS). That could transform it into a major player in the AI server chip market.
Nonetheless, considering the stock's performance in recent months, one could question whether this recent bounce is a sign that a sustainable recovery for Intel is coming, or if investors should continue to avoid the stock.
Intel's new lease on life
Without a doubt, Intel has fallen into decline, and its attempted return to prominence under CEO Pat Gelsinger has not gone as planned. The company made ambitious plans to spend tens of billions on new foundries to create a third-party chip manufacturing business that could compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) and Samsung.
It also made technical improvements and boldly claimed that it would return to process leadership by 2025. However, its planned $25 billion to $27 billion in capital expenditures over the next year will take a considerable toll on its balance sheet. Also, multiple sources told Reuters that chips Intel produced for Broadcom failed that company's tests, calling into question how well Intel can compete in that business.
The fact that Intel suspended its dividend and is laying off over 15% of its workforce shows that it has fallen well short of its goals. That news in August sent the stock to multiyear lows.





Yet its foundry business has shown potential for improvement. Intel will turn that business into a separate subsidiary, giving it its own operating board and the ability to raise capital separately. Additionally, the aforementioned deal with AWS could help make Intel's foundry business a top company in its industry.

Time Published: 20240920T150800
Summary: Spending for all things AI is ramping up.
Content: Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -1.21%) have soared over the last year, largely due to the soaring demand for cutting-edge chips capable of handling artificial intelligence (AI) workloads and a rebound in the broader semiconductor sector.
TSMC, as the company is also known, is the world's largest contract manufacturer of semiconductors, serving companies like Apple, Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD. It controls more than half of the third-party foundry market and is responsible for an estimated 90% of the advanced chips churned out by third-party manufacturers.
That makes TSMC one of the most important companies in the world, as semiconductors are essential components in most modern technology.
Its revenue growth has been accelerating and it has been generating strong margins. The chart below helps show why the stock has jumped by 99% over the last 12 months.
Cloud infrastructure spending is soaring
Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are the biggest cloud infrastructure providers in the world, and all three have ramped up their capital expenditures over the last four quarters as the AI boom has gathered momentum.






GOOGL Capital Expenditures (Quarterly) data by YCharts.
Combined, those three companies have added about $17 billion in capital expenditures to build new data centers and meet demand for the processing power to underpin new generative AI technologies. While some investors have criticized Microsoft and Alphabet, suggesting that they have been overspending on AI infrastructure, those companies have defended those investments, insisting that the risks of underspending and losing the AI race are greater than the risks of overspending.
A significant slice of that added spending is going toward chips that come out of TSMC's facilities, as the foundry giant manufactures plenty of high-end chips on behalf of Nvidia and others. As long as those companies are ramping up their capital expenditures, investors can expect TSMC stock to keep outperforming.

Summary: The tech sector players hold the potential for considerable growth.
Content: An investment budget of $2,000 may sound relatively modest when some stocks trade at higher prices per share than that. Nonetheless, many people have started their investing journeys with less, and whatever sum you're beginning with, the goal is, of course, to turn it into substantially more.
If you're looking for stocks with the potential to double at a relatively rapid pace, the tech sector is a good place to focus your search. These two tech stocks could make even a modest investor significantly wealthier over time.
1. AMD
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.50%) may not appear well-positioned to double at first glance. The semiconductor stock has lagged behind market leader Nvidia in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip space, and its revenue growth indicates that its gaming and embedded segments are also struggling.
Now, however, AMD is pushing full speed ahead into the AI accelerator market. While it sells merchant AI accelerators and added some new releases in this category recently, it has pivoted heavily into custom AI chips.
Moreover, the market is likely overlooking one key factor in its valuation of AMD: how AI chips have transformed chip companies. Three years ago, Nvidia's data center business (which includes its AI chips) was not its largest segment. Now, it makes up 88% of its revenue.





AMD could soon follow that path. In the second quarter, its revenue rose by only 9% yearly to $5.8 billion. That was far below the triple-digit percentage growth of Nvidia's top line.
However, AMD's data center revenue grew by 115% to $2.8 billion. Consequently, the data center segment is now its largest, accounting for 48% of company revenues. Assuming that trend continues, its total revenue should continue to grow even if other segments lag.
AMD's net income is also on the path to recovery. It reached $265 million in Q2, up from just $27 million in the prior-year period.

It still has a high P/E ratio, but its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is only 11. Not only is that

Time Published: 20240920T121500
Summary: Why TSMC and Arm Holdings are two top investment choices.
Content: Technology continues to shape the world we live in -- so perhaps, not surprisingly, the tech sector remains one the best places to invest. And when a tech company can provide services that are high in demand, this puts it in a special category all its own.
Let's look today at two such tech stocks to invest $1,000 in right now -- two companies that are go-to players in the complex process of chipmaking.
Taiwan Semiconductor
As the largest semiconductor contract manufacturer in the world, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -1.21%), or TSMC for short, is essentially the go-to company in the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure buildout. Whether Nvidia continues to hold its massive lead in AI chips with its graphic processing units (GPUs), or Advanced Micro Devices makes inroads, or companies begin to turn to custom chips from Broadcom, TSMC wins regardless.

As long as more and more chips are needed, whether for AI data centers or smartphones, TSMC benefits. On that front, capital expenditures (capex) related to AI just continue to increase.
For example, the top four hyperscale companies in the U.S. increased their capex budgets from $145 billion in 2023 to $202 billion in 2024, much of that directed toward AI. And that spending is only expected to increase as the large language models (LLMs) models needed for AI training advance, needing exponentially more computing power and GPUs. 





So far, the demand for TSMC's services are showing up in its results, with second-quarter revenue rising 33% in U.S. dollars and 40% in New Taiwan dollars. The strong revenue growth has continued in the current quarter, with 45% revenue growth in July and 33% in August in local currency.

With demand for its services so high, TSMC is in a strong position and will benefit not only from increased production, but also increased prices for its services, which it plans to raise next year. There are already reports that the company is set to raise pr

Title: Forget Nvidia: 1 Artificial Intelligence  ( AI )  Stock to Buy Instead

Time Published: 20240920T111500
Summary: Like Nvidia? Then you'll love this under-the-radar AI stock.
Content: I love Nvidia stock. Who wouldn't? Over the past year, shares have risen in value by more than 160%. Most of this rise can be attributed to rapid growth in demand for AI components. As the industry leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) -- a critical component for most AI infrastructures -- the company has seen demand skyrocket in recent years.
But Nvidia isn't the only company benefiting from the rise of AI. There's one significantly smaller business that is primed to benefit as well even if the market hasn't caught on yet.

Bet on AI with this under-the-radar stock
Everyone's talking about AI these days. The fervor has sent the valuations of most AI businesses soaring. Yet some companies haven't seen their market caps surge as much as others. One relatively small AI business in particular has fallen under the radar. There are risks to investing in this business but also massive potential upside.
The company in question is none other than SoundHound AI (SOUN -0.80%). I wrote about this AI business a few months ago. Since then, shares have appreciated in value by more than 20%. But the latest bump in valuation could prove to be just the beginning.
As its name suggests, SoundHound AI is focused on AI applications related to sound. This will be one of the biggest ways everyday consumers engage with AI technologies. Whether it's asking your phone what song is currently playing or chatting with a customer-support agent that's actually a robot in disguise, the revolution has already begun. But interacting with AI using your voice is still in the very early innings. In a few years, we may be discussing all sorts of things with the help of an AI agent.





SoundHound, for example, has already implemented its technology across a handful of automaker brands, including Kia, Hyundai, and Jeep which allows drivers to discuss maintenance issues and other mechanical questions directly with the vehicle. SoundHound has also partnered with restaurants, including Applebee's and

Title: Opinion: This Is the Best Artificial Intelligence  ( AI )  Stock to Buy Right Now

Time Published: 20240920T104500
Summary: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is slated to be a winner in the AI race.
Content: Naming the single best artificial intelligence (AI) stock to buy right now is no easy task. There are many considerations: what the company could do, what it's doing now, how expensive the stock is, and whether it has room to expand. All of these factors weigh into determining the best AI stock right now.
I think I've found the candidate with the perfect combination: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -1.21%). It's one of the few companies I know that excels in all of the factors I mentioned above, which makes a compelling investment case for the stock.
2024 has been an excellent year for TSMC
Taiwan Semiconductor -- also known as TSMC -- is the world's largest contract chip manufacturing company. Essentially, customers come to it with a chip design and TSMC produces it for them. Apple iPhones wouldn't be the same without TSMC, and Nvidia GPUs wouldn't be creating incredible AI models.
With the rising demand for AI chips, TSMC's 2024 monthly revenue has far exceeded that of 2023. Granted, 2023 was a relatively weak year for chip demand. However, continued outperformance month over month is a great sign that TSMC's business is picking up.

Taiwan Semiconductor also has great tailwinds upcoming. Apple accounts for about 25% of its revenue in any given year, and it's no secret that iPhone demand hasn't been that high. With Apple's AI model, Apple Intelligence, only available on iPhones 15 and newer models, this could ignite an upgrade cycle that will result in massive sales for TSMC.
TSMC is already developing the next generation of chips, even though its latest generation of 3-nanometer chips was just recently launched and is still growing in popularity. The 2nm chip can offer a 10% to 15% speed improvement over the 3nm chip when configured for the same power c

Time Published: 20240920T102500
Summary: Stock splits are sweeping the AI sector. Here's how to take advantage.
Content: Back in the dot-com boom era, stock splits became commonplace in response to soaring share prices. Amid the current artificial intelligence (AI) boom, a similar pattern could be developing. Already, several AI companies have split their shares, and more splits could be on the way among the others that are trading at lofty prices.
Investors should understand that stock splits don't fundamentally change the value of a stock or the underlying business, but they usually come in the wake of significant share price appreciation, and signal management's confidence that the stock can keep going higher.
There's also evidence, according to a Bank of America study, that stocks outperform in the year after they split. While there's no guarantee that any given stock-split stock will beat the S&P 500, it does offer historical evidence that the average stock-split stock does. On that note, these three AI stock-split stocks look like long-term winners.

1. Nvidia
Nvidia (NVDA -1.59%) needs little introduction at this point. The AI chip superstar has paced the sector, gaining roughly 700% since the start of 2023. Nvidia's most recent stock split -- a 10-for-1 split -- took effect after the market closed on June 7, and the stock is down since then.
Nvidia continues to show a lot of upside potential even as its market cap is now hovering just shy of $3 trillion. The company has a huge lead in data center GPUs, the cutting-edge chips needed to power AI models like ChatGPT, and it seems likely that its lead will only get wider following the launch of chips built on its new Blackwell platform in the fourth quarter.






Additionally, the company is on pace to keep growing rapidly; revenue rose 122% year over year in its fiscal 2025 second quarter to $30 billion. 
While some investors are concerned about the possibility of an AI sector bubble, there's still plenty of evidence that demand for Nvidia's components is soaring. The latest anecdote to support that

Time Published: 20240920T100500
Summary: These ETFs could all benefit as money supply growth accelerates over the next year.
Content: If there's one thing that's characterized the current bull market, it's the rise of big tech stocks leading the next generation of artificial intelligence (AI) innovation. Capital has piled into the biggest names in the market, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms. All five have played significant roles in the advancement of AI, and together, they account for 63% of the S&P 500's returns through the first half of 2024.
As a result of the meteoric rise of the world's biggest companies, market concentration is near levels investors haven't seen since the 1970s. While those big AI tech companies have produced solid earnings results, propelling their stocks higher, market concentration has historically always reversed course. One market indicator suggests the market may be about to broaden out.

U.S. money supply is finally growing again
Decelerating growth in money supply is typically tied to an increase in market concentration among a few large stocks, according to Khuram Chaudhry, head of European Quantitative Strategy at J.P. Morgan.
Think about it from the perspective of a business owner: If the money supply is tight, there's less access to cash to grow your business. If you're a very large business already, though, you can produce enough cash from operations that you don't need to worry about outside funding. Investors understand this dynamic, and the big get bigger. That trend is exacerbated by the high capital requirements of building an AI business, which is what's currently driving the bull market.
The money supply grew quickly in 2020 as the government injected cash into the economy with stimulus checks, and the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to 0%. Starting in 2021, we saw the after-effects of those policies start to take hold. We naturally saw slower growth, as measured by the U.S. M2 money supply. M2 includes cash in circulation, deposit accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of depos

Time Published: 20240920T092900
Summary: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently squashed concerns about the company's latest artificial intelligence chips.
Content: Nvidia (NVDA -1.59%) stock jumped 150% in the first half of 2024, but it has been in a slump since mid-July as investors digested some potential headwinds.
There was a rumored delay with the company's latest artificial intelligence (AI) chips for the data center, which are responsible for the majority of the company's revenue. Analysts have also questioned how long Nvidia's top customers will continue spending billions of dollars on their AI aspirations.
However, those concerns might have been put to rest over the last few weeks. Here's why Nvidia stock could soar to new highs before the end of 2024.

All eyes are on the new Blackwell GPUs
Nvidia's flagship H100 graphics processor (GPU) for the data center set the benchmark for the AI industry last year. GPUs are designed for parallel processing, which means they can handle multiple tasks at once while maintaining a high throughput. They also have built-in memory so they are ideal for processing large volumes of data, which is critical when training AI models and performing AI inference.
According to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, data center operators could spend $1 trillion building GPU infrastructure over the next few years. That presents a substantial opportunity, which is why the company continues to design new chips with more processing power and better energy efficiency to stay ahead of the competition.





Nvidia is now shipping its new H200 GPU, which can perform AI inference at almost twice the speed of the H100, while consuming half the amount of electricity. But the company recently unveiled an entirely new GPU architecture called Blackwell, which promises an even greater leap in performance.
The new Blackwell-based GB200 NVL72 system, for example, will perform AI inference at a staggering 30 times the pace of the equivalent H100 system. Each individual GB200 GPU will be priced between $30,000 and $40,000, which is similar to what many customers originally paid for the H100, so it's going to drive an incredib

Time Published: 20240920T092800
Summary: Semiconductor service companies will be critical to the artificial intelligence boom, but they don't attract as much attention from investors as chipmakers like Nvidia.
Content: Artificial intelligence (AI) is primarily deployed using centralized data centers, but it's slowly migrating to computers and smartphones, which could drive a productivity boom across the economy. None of that would be possible without the advanced semiconductors supplied by companies like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Micron Technology.
Some smaller companies provide critical equipment and services to those chip giants, but they tend to get less attention from investors. Axcelis Technologies (ACLS -0.92%), for example, supplies chip manufacturers with ion implantation equipment critical to the fabrication process, and AI is already driving up demand for the company's products.
Axcelis stock is very cheap relative to its peers right now. Here's why it might be a great buy as the AI revolution gathers momentum.

Image source: Getty Images.

A unique way to invest in the AI revolution
Ion implantation is a necessary part of the fabrication process for central processing units (CPUs), memory chips, and power devices (which regulate electric power in high-current applications). The power device segment has been especially lucrative for Axcelis over the last couple of years, thanks to the electric vehicle industry, which constantly looks for ways to charge batteries more quickly and squeeze more miles out of every charge.
But data centers built for AI present a new opportunity in this space because they consume a lot of energy. Some of Axcelis' customers started using silicon carbide-based trench MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor) power devices for their AI infrastructure. The silicon carbide chemistry is more heat-efficient and robust under heavy workloads than the traditional silicon chemistry, but it's more implant-intensive, which creates a direct tailwind for Axcelis' business.





AI chips also present a growing opportunity for Axcelis. Many data center graphics processing units (GPUs) designed by Nvidia come with built-in memory, whi

Title: Surprise! Billionaire Money Managers Are Selling Shares of Nvidia and Piling Into 2 Off-the-Radar Stock-Split Stocks.

Time Published: 20240920T085100
Summary: While investors flocked to the most-anticipated stock split of 2024, billionaires took the opportunity to buy shares of two other top-notch stock-split stocks.
Content: Although artificial intelligence (AI) has been an exceptionally popular market trend that has helped power the growth-fueled Nasdaq Composite and benchmark S&P 500 to new heights, the enthusiasm shown by investors for stocks conducting splits has played an equally vital role in lifting select equities higher in 2024.
A stock split allows a publicly traded company to adjust its share price and outstanding share count by the same factor. Splits are purely a cosmetic tool in the sense that they have no impact on a company's underlying operations or its market cap. Rather, they're designed to increase or decrease a company's share price, often with a very clear purpose.
A reverse split aims to increase a company's share price, usually with the goal of maintaining its listing on a major stock exchange. Since this type of split is often conducted by struggling businesses, it's one that investors tend to shy away from.

Image source: Getty Images.

On the other hand, forward stock splits reduce a company's share price to make it more nominally affordable to retail investors and/or employees who can't purchase fractional shares. This type of split is typically completed by top-notch businesses that are out-innovating and out-executing their peers. Unsurprisingly, this is where a majority of investors focus their attention.
Since 2024 began, a little over a dozen prominent businesses have announced or completed a stock split; only one was a reverse split.





Billionaire investors have certainly taken note of the outperformance of the Class of 2024 stock-split stocks. However, their outlook for this group is mixed.
While most investors have been fixated on brand-name stock-split stocks, such as Nvidia (NVDA -1.59%), billionaire money managers have been quietly sending shares of Nvidia to the chopping block in favor of two off-the-radar stock-split stocks.

Time Published: 20240920T084000
Summary: Should you be optimistic about this player too?
Content: Nvidia has been a tough act to follow in recent years. The artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant has delivered triple-digit increases in earnings quarter after quarter, and the share price has followed. Nvidia stock has soared more than 2,400% over the past five years, and considering the company's focus on innovation, this stellar performance may continue.
Though Nvidia has garnered the greatest share of investor attention in recent times, another tech player actually outperformed this AI powerhouse in the first half of the year. And this company followed in Nvidia's footsteps recently by announcing a stock split, a move to bring a high-flying share price down to earth -- and make the stock more accessible for a broader range of investors.
Now, Wall Street predicts this player's gains may be far from over. Let's meet the new stock-split stock that analysts think could nearly double within the coming 12 months...

Image source: Getty Images.

A triple-digit first-half gain
And this stock is Super Micro Computer (SMCI 4.59%), a company that saw its stock price soar 188% in the first half, surpassing Nvidia's 149% increase. Though individual forecasts vary, the average Wall Street estimate calls for the stock to climb 90% from today's level.
It's important to note that this once high-flying stock has been wading through difficult waters in recent weeks. A short report released by Hindenburg Research, alleging troubles at the company, has weighed on the shares. In an unrelated move, Supermicro delayed the filing of its 10-K annual report, and this has represented an additional headwind.





I see these as short-term pressures, but they don't change Supermicro's long-term story. And considering the 20% decline in the stock since the short report, it looks dirt cheap right now -- it trades for only 13 times forward earnings estimates, down from more than 45 times earlier in the year.

In recent days, some analysts have highlighted the potential of Supermicro. For exam

Trying to earn a high return with a stock that's already one of the most valuable companies in the world won't be easy, especially with expectations being so high for the business at this point.
If you want to earn a big return and turn $25,000 into more than $1 million, there is a safer and better way to do so -- assuming that you're willing to be patient. An exchange-traded fund (ETF) can allow you to generate some massive gains over the years, while also allowing you to keep your risk fairly low. You won't be overly exposed to just a single stock, the way you would be if you only bought shares of Nvidia.
An ETF that can be ideal for growth investors is the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ -0.19%). Here's why it can be a no-brainer buy.

The Invesco fund gives investors broad diversification in many growth stocks
If you want exposure to the top growth stocks in the world, odds are you'll look to the Nasdaq exchange, where many top tech stocks trade. The Invesco fund will narrow the list even further, however, giving you exposure to just the top 100 non-financial stocks on the exchange. This means you'll avoid some of the riskier stocks on the Nasdaq. Instead, you'll get access to some of the best and brightest growth stocks in the world.
Nvidia is one of the top holdings in the ETF, but it only accounts for 8% of its total weight. The ETF also holds shares of Costco Wholesale, Alphabet, Amazon, and many other big-name stocks. Although it's heavily skewed toward tech stocks (they account for half of the fund), other sectors of the market are represented in the fund as well, including healthcare, industrials, and consumer

Summary: Investors can own a slice of top artificial intelligence companies like Tesla, Nvidia, and Alphabet with this Ark Invest exchange-traded fund.
Content: Cathie Wood is the founder and chief investment officer of Ark Investment Management, which operates several exchange-traded and private funds. She is one of the most bullish voices on Wall Street when it comes to the long-term potential of technology stocks, which is reflected in Ark's various portfolios.
Each Ark fund has a unique theme designed to give investors exposure to different segments of the technology sector. The Ark Autonomous Technology and Robotics ETF (ARKQ), for example, invests in companies developing autonomous mobility solutions, robotics, and neural networks, all of which are powered by artificial intelligence (AI). 
That ETF is actively managed, so it can be a great way to invest in the emerging AI industry under the direction of a seasoned professional like Wood. However, it does come with risks.

The Ark Autonomous Tech and Robotics ETF runs a very concentrated portfolio
This Ark ETF was established in 2014 and currently manages $739 million in assets. Since it has a specific focus on autonomous technologies and robotics, its portfolio is highly concentrated and holds just 37 stocks. 
Its top five holdings represent 23.9% of the total value of that entire portfolio, but they include a couple of the biggest names in the AI space:

Tesla is more than just an electric vehicle manufacturer. It's also a leading developer of fully autonomous self-driving software, which could transform the company's economics over the long term. In fact, Cathie Wood says Tesla is the biggest AI opportunity in the world, and she thinks its stock could soar more than 1,000% by 2029.

Title: Meet the Supercharged Growth Stock Headed to $10 Trillion by 2030, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst
URL: https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/20/meet-the-supercharged-growth-stock-headed-to-10-tr/
Time Published: 20240920T073500
Summary: Numerous growth drivers and strong tailwinds should combine to drive this artificial intelligence (AI) pioneer higher.
Content: There's no denying that artificial intelligence (AI) has generated a lot of buzz since early last year. Recent technological advances have taken these algorithms to the next level, enabling them to generate original content of all stripes, improve productivity, and streamline processes.
Companies on the leading edge of this trend have profited from these advances in technology. In fact, six of the world's seven most valuable companies, when measured by market cap, have embraced the paradigm shift of generative AI and staked their claims to profits from these next-generation systems. Topping the charts are Apple and Microsoft, the only two companies that currently boast a market cap of more than $3 trillion.
However, one company that appears ordained to make a name for itself as a founding member of the $10 trillion club is Nvidia (NVDA -1.59%). The pioneer in graphics processing units (GPUs) is nipping at the heels of the current leaders with a market cap of $2.8 trillion but seems destined to break new ground.
Let's look at the numerous growth drivers that could send Nvidia stock to new heights.

Shall we play a game?
Nvidia revolutionized gaming a quarter of a century ago when the company pioneered the GPU, which produced lifelike images in video games. The secret to its success is parallel processing, or the ability of these advanced chips to process a multitude of mathematical calculations simultaneously. It wasn't long before Nvidia realized the vast potential of this discovery and pivoted to tailor this technology to a host of other applications.





The company has since adapted GPUs to power cloud computing, data centers, machine learning, autonomous driving, generative AI, and more.
The tale of the tape
Over the past 10 years, Nvidia's revenue has grown by 2,350% (as of this writing), while its net income has surged 9,490%. While it hasn't all been in a straight line, the company's consistently strong performance has driven imp

Title: Forget Nvidia: Buy This Magnificent Tech Stock Instead
URL: https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/20/forget-nvidia-buy-this-magnificent-stock-instead/
Time Published: 20240920T071000
Summary: This tech player is on track to prosper in the artificial intelligence market.
Content: Nvidia (NVDA -1.59%) has been the stock everyone is talking about for quite some time -- and for good reason. The company dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) chip niche with a market share of about 80%, and this has translated into record earnings. Even better, Nvidia's focus on innovation means its dominance is likely to last.
That said, Nvidia's stock isn't cheap, and it has lost some ground recently. It's down by about 7% over the past month, and is off by about 15% from the all-time high it touched this summer. I think that loss of momentum is temporary, though, and believe this top tech company still represents a fantastic long-term investment.
But right now, there exists a stock that has recently picked up momentum, is at an earlier stage in its latest growth story, and is inexpensive. This player, too, represents a great long-term investment. That's why, today, I would forget Nvidia and buy this magnificent tech stock instead.

A focus on cloud infrastructure
So which company am I talking about? One that was long known for its database software, but now is on its way to becoming a key player in the world of AI: Oracle (ORCL 0.24%). The tech company put a focus on cloud infrastructure and services as the AI boom accelerated, and this has turned out to be a smart strategy.
Today, the cloud services segment is the company's biggest business, and its operating income and earnings per share have taken off. Other financial metrics are showing amazing growth too. Cloud infrastructure revenue, for example, soared 45% year over year to $2.2 billion in its recently completed fiscal 2024 first quarter. Importantly, its remaining performance obligations surged 53% to $99 billion. This metric of yet-to-be-billed revenue offers visibility into its future growth.





I also like the fact that Oracle's return on invested capital, which dropped in recent years, is starting to head higher again -- showing that the company is progressively b

Time Published: 20240919T192401
Summary: Did the Fed's rate cut just open the door for Nvidia stock to go on another huge rally?
Content: Nvidia (NVDA -1.59%) stock is jumping Thursday following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut. The company's share price was up 4.9% as of 3 p.m. ET.

The Fed announced yesterday that it would be cutting interest rates by 50 basis points -- coming in higher than the 25-basis-point cut that many investors and analysts had anticipated. While the initial reaction to the rate cut didn't spur gains for the broader market, investors quickly became more bullish after weighing the move from the central banking authority. 
Investors have been eagerly awaiting a pivot to rate cuts as a potential bullish catalyst for the stock market and growth stocks in particular. After getting the chance to soak up some additional commentary on the economic outlook, investors are seeming more confident that inflation is under control and that the economy will avoid a recession in the near term.
Is Nvidia stock a buy after the Fed's rate cut?
If the economy stays relatively healthy and avoids contraction, the Fed's shift to rate cutting could help pave the way for a new bull rally that spurs big gains for Nvidia stock. Of course, there's still significant uncertainty on that front, and additional risk factors including geopolitical tensions could inject new bearish sentiment despite the rate cut.
But while investors shouldn't take the rate policy pivot as a clear indicator that Nvidia will continue to surge, the business is firing on all cylinders and continues to look like a worthwhile artificial intelligence (AI) stock for long-term investors. In addition to strong demand from hyperscale cloud companies and other large enterprises, Nvidia will likely see rising demand from government customers. The company has highlighted the importance of having "sovereign AI" as a key national priority for governments around the world, and spending from public sector customers is likely still in early stages of ramping up.

Title: Why Constellation Energy, NuScale Power, Nano Nuclear, and Oklo Stocks All Popped Today

Time Published: 20240920T161141
Summary: A famous nuclear power plant is coming back online.
Content: Nuclear power stocks are glowing green on Friday, and they have Constellation Energy (CEG 22.29%) to thank for it. This morning, the electric utility giant announced it will restart Unit 1 at the infamous Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide electricity to power Microsoft (MSFT -0.78%) data centers.
Nuclear power stocks are surging in response to the news. As of 10 a.m. ET, Constellation stock itself is up a strong 14.4%, while nuclear upstarts NuScale Power Corporation (SMR 11.34%) and Nano Nuclear Energy (NNE 22.95%) have gained 13% and 15%, respectively, and tiny Oklo (OKLO 27.23%) is leading the pack higher with a 16% gain.

Three Mile Island is in the news again
Let's start with some background for those who don't remember when Three Mile Island scared the pants off everyone living on the East Coast. In the middle of the night on March 28, 1979, Three Mile Island's Unit 2 reactor (near Middletown, Pennsylvania) suffered a partial meltdown in what the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) calls "the most serious accident in U.S. commercial nuclear power plant operating history." 
The release of radioactivity from the plant was minimal and caused "no detectable health effects on plant workers," much less nearby residents, according to the commission. Yet the terror inspired by the word "meltdown" alone sufficed to spark a movement, still ongoing, to tighten regulations on nuclear power plant construction. Thanks largely to these stricter regulations, operating a nuclear power plant is today one of the most expensive ways to produce electricity in the U.S. -- despite nuclear fuel being one of the cheapest fuels available. 
And yet America still needs power -- not least to run the giant server farms that power the kinds of artificial intelligence projects and cloud computing services that Microsoft wants to provide.





Why Constellation is reopening Three Mile Island
Hence today's news. Having just signed "its largest-ever power purchase agreemen

Title: Why Cameco Stock Popped 8% on Friday

Time Published: 20240920T153724
Summary: Interest in uranium stocks is blowing up.
Content: Uranium stocks are glowing green on Friday, and they have Constellation Energy to thank for it. This morning, the electric utility giant announced plans to restart Unit 1 at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant by 2028, in order to supply power to Microsoft data centers.
In no time flat, shares of uranium mining stocks such as Energy Fuels, Uranium Energy, and Denison Mines began powering up. None went so far as Cameco Corporation (CCJ 8.08%), however, which as of 11:10 a.m. ET is gaining 8%.

Why Cameco stock is glowing green today
It's no great mystery why. A big electric utility is restarting a nuclear plant, and that plant will need uranium to generate power. Uranium miners provide that uranium -- and so their stocks rise.
But this story is even bigger than Three Mile Island, because where Constellation leads, other power plant operators may follow. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, there are currently 54 nuclear power plants operating in the U.S., running 94 reactors. Additionally, EIA says 22 reactors are "in various stages of decommissioning," and could theoretically be reactivated. 
Although only one new reactor is under construction in the U.S., multiple small nuclear power start-ups, with names like NuScale Power Corporation and Nano Nuclear Energy, are working to get approval for new, smaller-scale nuclear power plant designs.





Is Cameco stock a buy?
All of which is to say, there's potential for quite a bit of growth in nuclear power in the United States, and for growth in demand for uranium fuel. As the only U.S.-listed uranium miner that's currently both profitable and free-cash-flow-positive (according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence), Cameco stock is a logical beneficiary of this trend -- if it does turn into a trend.
That doesn't make Cameco stock a buy necessarily, however. Valued at 46 times free cash flow and 94 times trailing earnings, and paying only a 0.2% dividend, Cameco may be the best bargain in u

URL: https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/20/1-favorable-trend-that-explains-the-99-increase-in/
Time Published: 20240920T150800
Summary: Spending for all things AI is ramping up.
Content: Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -1.21%) have soared over the last year, largely due to the soaring demand for cutting-edge chips capable of handling artificial intelligence (AI) workloads and a rebound in the broader semiconductor sector.
TSMC, as the company is also known, is the world's largest contract manufacturer of semiconductors, serving companies like Apple, Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD. It controls more than half of the third-party foundry market and is responsible for an estimated 90% of the advanced chips churned out by third-party manufacturers.
That makes TSMC one of the most important companies in the world, as semiconductors are essential components in most modern technology.
Its revenue growth has been accelerating and it has been generating strong margins. The chart below helps show why the stock has jumped by 99% over the last 12 months.
Cloud infrastructure spending is soaring
Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are the biggest cloud infrastructure providers in the world, and all three have ramped up their capital expenditures over the last four quarters as the AI boom has gathered momentum.






GOOGL Capital Expenditures (Quarterly) data by YCharts.
Combined, those three companies have added about $17 billion in capital expenditures to build new data centers and meet demand for the processing power to underpin new generative AI technologies. While some investors have criticized Microsoft and Alphabet, suggesting that they have been overspending on AI infrastructure, those companies have defended those investments, insisting that the risks of underspending and losing the AI race are greater than the risks of overspending.
A significant slice of that added spending is going toward chips that come out of TSMC's facilities, as the foundry giant manufactures plenty of high-end chips on behalf of Nvidia and others. As long as those companies are ramping up their capital expenditures, investors can expect TSMC stock to keep outperforming.

Title: Better AI Stock: Microsoft vs. Alphabet
URL: https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/20/better-ai-stock-microsoft-vs-alphabet/
Time Published: 20240920T130000
Summary: Both big tech players are benefiting from AI's rise.
Content: The artificial intelligence (AI) race is still in its early stages, though it might not feel like it, and there's still plenty of time for tech companies to overtake each other. For investors looking for opportunities in the space, it may be appealing to pick a small AI start-up that might grow by leaps and bounds, but larger companies have deeper pockets, making their AI investments (and shifting strategies) much more likely to succeed.
Which ones will prove to be the best AI stocks in the coming years? Let's take a look at what Microsoft (MSFT -0.78%) and Alphabet (GOOG 0.86%) (GOOGL 0.89%) are doing to shore up their AI dominance, and consider which one is more likely to be the better artificial intelligence stock in the coming years.
Why Microsoft is a leading AI play
Let's start with the most obviously smart AI move Microsoft has made: It invested an estimated $13 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. That gave Microsoft early access to some of the most advanced AI models available, and it wisely started embedding them into nearly all of its software products.

ChatGPT is the underlying AI tech in Microsoft's Copilot tools, which are now in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams. The software bundle they comprise, Microsoft 365, is used by 1.3 million companies in the U.S. alone. For tens of millions of workers, Microsoft's software is now synonymous with the advanced AI tools they use every day.
This integration is already paying off for Microsoft, and the best example may come from the company's GitHub developer platform, in which 40% of its recent revenue growth came from Copilot, according to management. Microsoft's leadership said on the fourth-quarter earnings call that AI is driving GitHub's growth and has boosted its annual revenue run rate to $2 billion.





Of course, Microsoft isn't just a software company these days. Its Azure unit is the second-largest cloud computing infrastructure provider in the world, with 25% of the market. Microsoft has in

Time Published: 20240920T100500
Summary: These ETFs could all benefit as money supply growth accelerates over the next year.
Content: If there's one thing that's characterized the current bull market, it's the rise of big tech stocks leading the next generation of artificial intelligence (AI) innovation. Capital has piled into the biggest names in the market, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms. All five have played significant roles in the advancement of AI, and together, they account for 63% of the S&P 500's returns through the first half of 2024.
As a result of the meteoric rise of the world's biggest companies, market concentration is near levels investors haven't seen since the 1970s. While those big AI tech companies have produced solid earnings results, propelling their stocks higher, market concentration has historically always reversed course. One market indicator suggests the market may be about to broaden out.

U.S. money supply is finally growing again
Decelerating growth in money supply is typically tied to an increase in market concentration among a few large stocks, according to Khuram Chaudhry, head of European Quantitative Strategy at J.P. Morgan.
Think about it from the perspective of a business owner: If the money supply is tight, there's less access to cash to grow your business. If you're a very large business already, though, you can produce enough cash from operations that you don't need to worry about outside funding. Investors understand this dynamic, and the big get bigger. That trend is exacerbated by the high capital requirements of building an AI business, which is what's currently driving the bull market.
The money supply grew quickly in 2020 as the government injected cash into the economy with stimulus checks, and the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to 0%. Starting in 2021, we saw the after-effects of those policies start to take hold. We naturally saw slower growth, as measured by the U.S. M2 money supply. M2 includes cash in circulation, deposit accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of depos

Time Published: 20240920T093500
Summary: Brookfield Renewable could generate a supercharged total return in the coming years.
Content: Brookfield Renewable (BEPC 0.70%) (BEP 0.84%) has a stellar record of paying dividends. The leading global renewable energy producer has grown its payout at a 6% compound annual rate over the last two decades. It has raised its payment by at least 5% for 13 years in a row. 
The company is just getting started. It has several catalysts that should combine to deliver 10%-plus annual growth in its funds from operations (FFO) per share through at least 2028. That will easily give it the power to support its plan of raising the dividend by 5% to 9% annually. With Brookfield Renewable already offering a high-yielding payout (more than 4.5%), it should have the fuel to generate supercharged total returns in the coming years. 

Built on a rock-solid foundation
Brookfield Renewable operates one of the world's largest publicly traded renewable energy platforms. It owns hydro, wind, utility-scale solar, distributed energy, and storage assets across all major markets that have the capacity to produce 34 gigawatts (GW) of power. In addition, it has a growing portfolio of sustainable solutions, like biofuel production, recycling, carbon capture and storage, and nuclear services. These assets generate predictable, stable cash flow backed by long-term contracts with utilities and large corporations.
Most of its contracts index prices to inflation (70% of Brookfield's revenue). Because of that, they should supply the company with stable and steadily rising cash flow. Brookfield expects its FFO per share to increase by 2% to 3% per year due to inflation escalation alone. 
The company paid out less than 75% of its stable cash flow in dividends during the first half of this year. That gave it a solid cushion and allowed it to retain cash to help fund its continued expansion. 





Brookfield also has a very strong balance sheet. It has investment-grade credit and primarily uses long-term, fixed-rate debt to fund its business. The company also has lots of liquidity, which it routinely r

Summary: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently squashed concerns about the company's latest artificial intelligence chips.
Content: Nvidia (NVDA -1.59%) stock jumped 150% in the first half of 2024, but it has been in a slump since mid-July as investors digested some potential headwinds.
There was a rumored delay with the company's latest artificial intelligence (AI) chips for the data center, which are responsible for the majority of the company's revenue. Analysts have also questioned how long Nvidia's top customers will continue spending billions of dollars on their AI aspirations.
However, those concerns might have been put to rest over the last few weeks. Here's why Nvidia stock could soar to new highs before the end of 2024.

All eyes are on the new Blackwell GPUs
Nvidia's flagship H100 graphics processor (GPU) for the data center set the benchmark for the AI industry last year. GPUs are designed for parallel processing, which means they can handle multiple tasks at once while maintaining a high throughput. They also have built-in memory so they are ideal for processing large volumes of data, which is critical when training AI models and performing AI inference.
According to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, data center operators could spend $1 trillion building GPU infrastructure over the next few years. That presents a substantial opportunity, which is why the company continues to design new chips with more processing power and better energy efficiency to stay ahead of the competition.





Nvidia is now shipping its new H200 GPU, which can perform AI inference at almost twice the speed of the H100, while consuming half the amount of electricity. But the company recently unveiled an entirely new GPU architecture called Blackwell, which promises an even greater leap in performance.
The new Blackwell-based GB200 NVL72 system, for example, will perform AI inference at a staggering 30 times the pace of the equivalent H100 system. Each individual GB200 GPU will be priced between $30,000 and $40,000, which is similar to what many customers originally paid for the H100, so it's going to drive an incredib

Time Published: 20240920T073500
Summary: Numerous growth drivers and strong tailwinds should combine to drive this artificial intelligence (AI) pioneer higher.
Content: There's no denying that artificial intelligence (AI) has generated a lot of buzz since early last year. Recent technological advances have taken these algorithms to the next level, enabling them to generate original content of all stripes, improve productivity, and streamline processes.
Companies on the leading edge of this trend have profited from these advances in technology. In fact, six of the world's seven most valuable companies, when measured by market cap, have embraced the paradigm shift of generative AI and staked their claims to profits from these next-generation systems. Topping the charts are Apple and Microsoft, the only two companies that currently boast a market cap of more than $3 trillion.
However, one company that appears ordained to make a name for itself as a founding member of the $10 trillion club is Nvidia (NVDA -1.59%). The pioneer in graphics processing units (GPUs) is nipping at the heels of the current leaders with a market cap of $2.8 trillion but seems destined to break new ground.
Let's look at the numerous growth drivers that could send Nvidia stock to new heights.

Image source: Getty Images.

Shall we play a game?
Nvidia revolutionized gaming a quarter of a century ago when the company pioneered the GPU, which produced lifelike images in video games. The secret to its success is parallel processing, or the ability of these advanced chips to process a multitude of mathematical calculations simultaneously. It wasn't long before Nvidia realized the vast potential of this discovery and pivoted to tailor this technology to a host of other applications.





The company has since adapted GPUs to power cloud computing, data centers, machine learning, autonomous driving, generative AI, and more.
The tale of the tape
Over the past 10 years, Nvidia's revenue has grown by 2,350% (as of this writing), while its net income has surged 9,490%. While it hasn't all been in a straight line, the company's consistently strong performance has driven imp

Title: Forget Nvidia: Buy This Magnificent Tech Stock Instead

Time Published: 20240920T071000
Summary: This tech player is on track to prosper in the artificial intelligence market.
Content: Nvidia (NVDA -1.59%) has been the stock everyone is talking about for quite some time -- and for good reason. The company dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) chip niche with a market share of about 80%, and this has translated into record earnings. Even better, Nvidia's focus on innovation means its dominance is likely to last.
That said, Nvidia's stock isn't cheap, and it has lost some ground recently. It's down by about 7% over the past month, and is off by about 15% from the all-time high it touched this summer. I think that loss of momentum is temporary, though, and believe this top tech company still represents a fantastic long-term investment.
But right now, there exists a stock that has recently picked up momentum, is at an earlier stage in its latest growth story, and is inexpensive. This player, too, represents a great long-term investment. That's why, today, I would forget Nvidia and buy this magnificent tech stock instead.

A focus on cloud infrastructure
So which company am I talking about? One that was long known for its database software, but now is on its way to becoming a key player in the world of AI: Oracle (ORCL 0.24%). The tech company put a focus on cloud infrastructure and services as the AI boom accelerated, and this has turned out to be a smart strategy.
Today, the cloud services segment is the company's biggest business, and its operating income and earnings per share have taken off. Other financial metrics are showing amazing growth too. Cloud infrastructure revenue, for example, soared 45% year over year to $2.2 billion in its recently completed fiscal 2024 first quarter. Importantly, its remaining performance obligations surged 53% to $99 billion. This metric of yet-to-be-billed revenue offers visibility into its future growth.





I also like the fact that Oracle's return on invested capital, which dropped in recent years, is starting to head higher again -- showing that the company is progressively b

Still, some winners have yet to make money from selling AI-related services and products but are well-positioned to do so in the future. Tesla (TSLA -2.33%), one of the leading technology companies of our generation, is among those companies.

From EV to autonomous driving
Tesla, arguably, has contributed more to the automotive industry than any incumbent car maker since Ford Motor Company introduced its Model T in the early 1900s. The EV maker almost single-handedly drove the mass adoption of electric cars in the U.S. when most of the incumbents were skeptical of the potential of EV cars.
And while the EV transition will probably take decades to complete, the tech company is now riding on an even more significant trend of autonomous driving. According to McKinsey & Company, passenger car advanced driver-assistance and autonomous driving systems could generate $300 to $400 billion in revenue by 2035. And that's just revenue from selling these systems. The rise of autonomous driving systems could also open up other business opportunities for Tesla, such as launching a robotaxi service.
There are good reasons to believe that Tesla is a front-runner well-positioned to grab a decent, if not substantial, market share in this emerging industry. For instance, Tesla has a huge fleet of vehicles (in the millions) that are constantly generating real-world driving data. This massive (and ever-growing) data set helps train Tesla's models used to develop autonomous driving software, allowing the tech company to maintain its leadership in the autonomous driving race.





Besides, Tesla's vertical integration from manufacturing cars to designing its software and chips gives i

Title: Should You Buy the 3 Highest-Paying Dividend Stocks in the S&P 500?
URL: https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/17/should-you-buy-highest-paying-dividend-stocks/
Time Published: 20240917T200822
Summary: Dividend stocks could get more attention as interest rates fall.
Content: Dividend stocks could soon get a closer look from investors. That's because the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates on Wednesday, beginning a new cycle of lower rates, which will bring down Treasury yields and interest rates on savings accounts.
That process makes dividend stocks more attractive. Dividend stocks are likely to move higher as bond yields fall because bond investors will rotate back into dividend stocks in search of yield.
If you're looking for dividend stocks, a good place to start your search is the S&P 500. Let's take a look at the three highest-yielding dividend stocks in the broad-market index today.

Image source: Getty Images.

1. Walgreens Boots Alliance (dividend yield: 11.1%)
If you're a dividend investor, it's important to understand the difference between a high-yield stock and a yield trap, and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA -3.01%) looks like a classic example of a yield trap.
Shares of the pharmacy chain are down a whopping 65% year to date, declining steadily as it's struggled with a loss of COVID-related revenue, narrowing margins in its pharmacy business, an ongoing decline in the retail business, and challenges related to the misguided acquisition of VillageMD, a primary care clinic, which has led to significant losses in the business.






According to conventional metrics, Walgreens now looks dirt cheap, trading at a forward P/E of just above 3, but that's based on adjusted earnings. However, that likely reflects investor fears over more write-downs and falling profits in the coming quarter. In fact, the company has taken impairment charges of $13.6 billion this year, mostly related to its acquisition of VillageMD.
It also had a negative free cash flow of $1.5 billion this year. 
Walgreens could be forced to cut its dividend again, and the company seems likely to be removed from the S&P 500 soon as its market cap falls below $8 billion. The stock is best avoided.
2. Altria (dividend yield: 7.9%)
Altria Group (MO 0.32%) was one

Content: MONTREAL, Sept.  17, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stingray (TSX: RAY.A; RAY.B), a leading music, media, and technology company, is launching Stingray Karaoke in Ford Motor Company’s vehicles – starting with the all-electric F-150® Lightning® and Mustang Mach-E, and coming soon to vehicles with the Ford and Lincoln Digital Experience. This will be the first time karaoke is available for Ford owners to use and enjoy inside the vehicle while parked and on the go. While owners are parked or waiting for their vehicle to charge, they will be able to view the lyrics of the song they have selected on the in-vehicle screen so everyone in the vehicle can participate in the fun.  This unique experience was developed in collaboration between the Stingray and Ford engineering teams. Here’s how it works: While driving, if the in-vehicle app is opened and the vehicle detects a passenger is in the front seat and buckled, the app will ask for confirmation that a passenger is in the front seat and a QR code will appear.* The passenger can use their smartphone to scan the QR code and a web page will open to control the karaoke experience from their smartphone without having to login to an app. Passengers can add songs to their playlist, change songs, view scrolling lyrics and utilize the vehicle’s audio system. "Expanding Stingray's entertainment services to Ford vehicles marks a significant step in our mission to enrich the in-car experience," said Jim Riley, President, US Division at Stingray. "The debut of Stingray Karaoke in Ford vehicles underscores Stingray's dedication to bringing innovative solutions to the automotive industry to engage customers at a time when consumers are expecting a richer entertainment experience in their vehicle." Owners and their passengers can easily find songs by searching by title, artist, lyrics, era or genre. There is also a wide selection of songs and music styles from Rock, Country, Pop, R&B, Latin, K&J Pop and family-friendly tunes for all ages. Th

Time Published: 20240920T183824
Summary: FedEx results indicate investors should not expect a quick recovery in the transport sector.
Content: FedEx sounded the alarm, and investors in its archrival are taking notice.
Shares of United Parcel Service (UPS -2.67%) traded down 3% as of 2 p.m. ET after FedEx missed quarterly expectations and lowered its full-year forecast.
Falling in sympathy
Transportation companies have been stuck in traffic for the last few years. A surge in shipments after the height of the pandemic gave way to a slowdown as the economy cooled and interest rates spiked higher, leading to soft pricing.
The question for investors has been how long the down cycle will last. Judging from FedEx's results, there will be no quick recovery.
FedEx missed top- and bottom-line expectations and cut its guidance for full-year profits. Although UPS is separate and its business mix is a little different from FedEx, investors are understandably concerned that the "challenging" market impacting FedEx will also eat into UPS' results in the quarters to come. The outlook was weakest for FedEx's premium offerings, suggesting a lack of pricing power in the months ahead.






Is UPS stock a buy?
UPS, like FedEx, is a stalwart of the global economy. The company's services are hard to replace, and there is a good chance that over time the company, and the stock, can outperform the market.
That said, it is hard to outrun the business cycle. And UPS' new labor contracts, reached after difficult negotiations last year, will weigh on results in the near term. Investors should feel no urgency to rush in and buy the dip.

Summary: A weak quarterly report shows the logistics giant's turnaround efforts will take time to show results.
Content: FedEx (FDX -15.23%) reported weaker-than-expected quarterly results after the closing bell Thursday, and lowered its profit outlook for the fiscal year.
Investors Friday don't appear interested in going along for the ride -- they've sent FedEx shares down by more than 14% as of 10:45 a.m. ET.
Challenging times
It has been a difficult few years for transportation companies. Rising interest rates and fears about the health of the economy have led many companies to cut back on inventories, which has in turn led to less demand for business-to-business shipments.
Those pressures do not appear to be easing. In its fiscal 2025 first quarter, which ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $3.60 per share on revenue of $21.6 billion, falling short of Wall Street's consensus estimates for earnings of $4.76 per share on sales of $21.9 billion.
Revenue was down slightly year over year, with FedEx reporting decreased demand for its higher-margin priority services.





"Despite a challenging quarter, we remain focused on transforming our network, improving our efficiency, lowering our cost-to-serve, and enhancing our ability to adapt with speed to evolving market dynamics," CEO Raj Subramaniam said in the earnings release.

Is FedEx stock a buy?
FedEx cut its guidance for fiscal 2025 earnings per share to a range of $20 to $21 (down from $20 to $22 previously), and cut its outlook for revenue growth to a low-single-digit percentage from the low- to mid-single-digit percentage range it had earlier targeted. Management has rolled out a cost-cutting program, but that will take time to fully implement.
"Overall, I remain confident in the value-creation opportunities ahead as we focus on reducing our structural cost, growing revenue profitably, and leveraging the insights from our vast collection of data as we continue to build the world's most flexible, efficient and intelligent network," Subramaniam said.
FedEx is an integral part of the global supply chain, and the company should do well over

Summary: The Oracle of Omaha has purchased shares of this company for 24 consecutive quarters, dating back to the midpoint of 2018.
Content: Few investors receive as much attention on Wall Street as Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.34%) (BRK.B -0.96%) CEO Warren Buffett. This is because the Oracle of Omaha has lapped Wall Street's benchmark index, the S&P 500, many times over.
Since taking the reins at Berkshire in the mid-1960s, Buffett has overseen an aggregate return in his company's Class A shares of more than 5,400,000%. Comparatively, the S&P 500 has increased in value, including dividends, by around 37,000% over the same span.
Buffett's well-publicized recipe for success has involved buying stakes in time-tested businesses that offer clear-cut competitive advantages and strong management teams. Most importantly, he looks to the horizon when investing and tends to hold on to positions in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio for years, if not decades, at a time.

While mirroring Buffett's investment activity has, for decades, been a moneymaking strategy, investors will have to do some unconventional digging to locate his favorite stock to buy.





Warren Buffett has been a very selective buyer of stocks for nearly two years
No later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides an easy-to-understand snapshot of which stocks, industries, sectors, and trends Wall Street's best money managers bought into and sold out of in the latest quarter.
Warren Buffett's 13Fs for the last seven quarters (Oct. 1, 2022 to June 30, 2024) show that he and his top investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have been unabashed sellers, with net stock sales totaling close to $132 billion. With Berkshire's chief sending roughly
