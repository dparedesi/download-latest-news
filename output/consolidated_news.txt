Tech stocks surged in recent trading, pushing the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq to record highs. Intel (INTC) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 after Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion in the struggling chipmaker, and the two agreed to co-develop new data center and PC chips. Nvidia (NVDA) shares were up as well. Shares of PayPal (PYPL) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) also gained following an agreement that will have PayPal use Google’s artificial intelligence tools to boost internet commerce. CrowdStrike (CRWD) shares jumped after the cybersecurity firm gave a better-than-expected forecast for annual recurring revenue. Darden Restaurants (DRI) shares slumped as the owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse chains missed profit estimates and warned higher costs could hurt future earnings. Shares of another restaurant operator, Cracker Barrel (CBRL), sank as the blowback from the restaurant chain’s location updates and logo change hit its results and guidance. A lower-than-anticipated outlook sent shares of Nucor (NUE) lower. The steelmaker said it sees weakness in all its segments. Oil futures rose and gold prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note advanced. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro, pound, and yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded higher.

Title: Pundit Shares ‘XRP Endgame’: What To Watch Out For With Ripple
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-endgame-with-ripple/

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Crypto pundit Pumpius is drawing attention to what he calls the “XRP Endgame,” saying all the key pieces are falling into place for Ripple and its token. According to him, these shifts put XRP in a rare position to rise above other digital assets. Global rules and banking standards are also moving in Ripple’s favor at the same time. Pumpius stresses that Ripple’s victory in its long fight with the SEC is not just a legal win but a turning point. After years in court, XRP now has the strongest legal clarity of any cryptocurrency in the U.S. He also points to Ripple’s launch of RLUSD, its enterprise stablecoin backed by reserves at BNY Mellon. Pumpius notes that this connection matters because BNY Mellon safeguards trillions in assets for global giants, including BlackRock and the U.S. Treasury. Tying a stablecoin to XRP’s payment rails creates what he calls a “stable reserve army” that strengthens trust in Ripple’s network. On the banking front, Pumpius explains that Ripple is not only licensed as a money service business but has also applied for the highly difficult New York banking charter. He adds that Ripple has taken it a step further by applying for a Federal Reserve master account, the highest privilege in the U.S. banking system. If granted, Ripple would not just compete with banks but effectively act as one, placing XRP at the center of financial settlements. Pumpius notes that nearly 20 XRP spot ETFs are awaiting approval. If greenlit, these funds could open the doors to trillions of dollars from institutional investors and push XRP into the ranks of Wall Street assets overnight. Another major shift is the migration to ISO 20022, a global messaging standard that all major banks must adhere to by November. Pumpius points out that XRP has been ready for this for years, meaning RippleNet can easily connect with traditional banking rails the moment the change takes effect. Additionally, he notes that XRP is in the liquidity tokenization plan of DTCC, the world’s largest settlement utility. At the same time, he notes that the DNA Protocol is quietly developing biometric and genomic identity tools on the XRP Ledger. This step could solve Know Your Customer checks at the deepest level, blending finance and digital identity in a way no other blockchain has achieved. Ripple benefits as he notes the rise of a supportive political environment. A pro-crypto administration is pushing laws that fit Ripple’s long-term playbook. With regulators and policymakers leaning in the same direction, he believes the stage is set for XRP to move into its endgame.

Δ This collaboration will see the companies launch trading and lending solutions powered by tokenized money market funds and stablecoins, Ripple announced Thursday (Sept. 18). “2025 has been marked by a series of industry-firsts when it comes to traditional financial institutions moving onchain — and the linkup between Ripple, DBS and Franklin Templeton to enable repo trades for a tokenized money market fund with a regulated, stable and liquid mode of exchange such as RLUSD is truly a game-changer,” said Nigel Khakoo, vice president and global head of trading and markets at Ripple. “Investors can also seamlessly rebalance their portfolios between a stablecoin and a yield-generating money market fund, all within a single, trusted ecosystem, unlocking real-world capital efficiency, utility and liquidity that institutions demand.” According to a Ripple news release, the partnership will see DBS’s Digital Exchange list sgBENJI — the token of Franklin Templeton’s tokenized money market fund — alongside Ripple’s RLUSD. This setup lets DBS clients trade RLUSD for sgBENJI tokens, allowing them to “rebalance their portfolios into a relatively stable asset 24/7 and within minutes, while earning yield during periods of volatility,” the companies said.

Title: Trump Pals The Ellison Boys Gonna Save CBS And TikTok From Woke Bias!
URL: https://www.wonkette.com/p/trump-pals-the-ellison-boys-gonna
Time Published: 2025-09-18T15:02:02Z
Full Content:
Sounds like President Trump is inching closer towards his wish to be king of all media and star of every stage! He coyly hinted on his shitty web platform on Monday: The big Trade Meeting in Europe between The United States of America, and China, has gone VERY WELL! It will be concluding shortly. A deal was also reached on a “certain” company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy! I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday. The relationship remains a very strong one!!! President DJT And Trump’s sherpa of deals/ mean drunk/ Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there was a “framework for a deal” for a TikTok sale, though he has said the words “framework for a deal” eleventy-hundred times. Through the months of Trump’s insane pingponging deals with China we have learned that “framework” and “deal” are two very different things. Though at least this is better than the “handshake for a framework” Howard Lutnick said they had back in June. So on Friday are Trump and Scott Bessent really, finally going to get that deal from China on those rare earth minerals, the ones US tech companies need to make all of their AI chips, planes, and high-tech gadgets that Trump screwed them out of by self-embargoing the US? It’s concepts of a framework for maybe! Subscribe! But anyway, word on the street, aka CBS and the Wall Street Journal, is that the deal old Pappy was going on about up there is the potential sale of TikTok to Oracle, whose CEO is his close pal Larry Ellison, and some private equity firms. If the name rings a bell, it’s because Larry Ellison’s son David is the new chairman and CEO of Paramount, after completing a merger between Paramount (CBS’s parent company) and Ellison’s company, Skydance. And both father and son are longtime Republican donors. And father Larry may be richer than Elon Musk now! At least he’s not in on the deal. Oh, and now Paramount Skydance is reportedly in talks to buy Warner Brothers Discovery, too, the parent company of CNN. Those Ellison boys are making the kind of cross-platform Republican media control that Project 2025 once only dreamed of! How long until somebody greenlights that immigration reality show that Kristi Noem denied she was workshopping? TikTok being forced under his thumb has apparently long been a wish of Trump’s, at least since app users first ground his gears back in 2020 by registering to attend his rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with no intention of showing up, causing his delicate ego embarrassment when the yuge surging crowd he was expecting turned out to be a mere trickle. He raged for TikTok to be BANNED, because something something Chinese spies, and Congress passed an act that banned the app unless its algorithm was put under the control of a US company. And Joe Biden signed it! Remember that extra-stupid hearing with TikTok’s CEO Shou Chew, with Tom Cotton refusing to accept that he is from Singapore, which is a whole different country than China, and how embarrassingly pig-ignorant the senators were about the basics of how the Internet even works? But, the Chinese government doesn’t and has never owned TikTok. A Chinese man founded it and is still 20 percent of the board, but the company was never incorporated in China. There has been no evidence that the Chinese government ever had access to user data, much less that they were using it to spy on dissidents or Americans making cucumber salads. TikTok is owned by ByteDance Ltd., which is headquartered in the Cayman Islands, and TikTok Inc. is headquartered in Los Angeles and Singapore. And its servers — ORACLE servers, in fact — dish out its secret-sauce algorithm from Virginia. Sixty percent of ByteDance is currently owned by non-Chinese global institutional investors including Susquehanna International Group (majority shareholder Jeff Yass), the Carlyle Group, General Atlantic, KKR, BlackRock, and Tiger Global Management; 20 percent of the firm is owned by Beijing-based founder Zhang Yiming, and 20 percent is owned by employees. But Congress and Biden decided to ban the app anyway, after Trump had said it was a CHINESE SPY EMERGENCY. And then some curious things happened! Jeff Yass, the managing director of Susquehanna International Group, the company that is also the largest shareholder of TikTok’s parent company, bought two percent of Digital World Acquisition Corporation, which merged with Trump Media & Technology Group, making its share price surge 140 percent, defibrillating Trump’s flatlining company. And then right before the ‘24 election, the TikTok algorithm underwent a noticeable shift, and Trumpy content began appearing in people’s feeds when it hadn’t before. And TikTok CEO Shou Chew attended Trump’s inauguration in January. And after his win, Trump credited TikTok with helping him win more young voters, so he loved it again and decided to save it, even going to the Supreme Court to try to stop them from enacting the ban he himself had asked Congress to pass. The deadline for a sale has since been extended four times already, and has now been pushed off until December 16. The Wall Street Journal has more details of the prospective deal: The company’s board would stay the same, except that Zhang Yiming’s stake would be reduced to less than 20 percent, and a consortium of US companies, including Susquehanna International, KKR, General Atlantic Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz would control 80 percent of the company. A new US entity would be created, with a board with one member designated by the US government, which is unheard of. And the US company would license the magic algorithm, putting it into a new US version of the app, so that the Trumpy board would be able to customize it and make it massage everybody’s feed this way and that, promoting the reach of some accounts and limiting access to others. Meanwhile, CBS under control of its new owner Paramount has a whole other vibe. Paramount Global and CBS CEO George Cheeks hasn’t been fired (yet), but he obeyed in advance. The Late Show with Stephen Colbert was cancelled before the deal even went down, and Trump’s claims against 60 Minutes for making Kamala Harris look too smart got settled for a $16 million donation to his presidential library before the merger was approved. And CBS News employees say Ellison the younger broke his promise not to politicize their news reporting almost immediately, reportedly entering talks to buy The Free Press, owned by anti-woke “free speech” crusader Bari Weiss, who got her start ratting out professors for being pro-Arab, for “well above” $100 million and installing her into some kind of a senior leadership role to tone-police the reporting at CBS News. PREVIOUSLY! And Ellison brought on a conservative thinktanker from the Hudson Institute, Kenneth R. Weinstein, to be an ombudsman rooting out any “complaints of bias” that might aggrieve conservatives at CBS. But it all doesn’t go far enough for everybody on the Right, of course. Now at least one Federalist Society weirdo is proposing that the government shut down Bluesky, and Discord too. But social media sites, they’re not just for cat memes! Businesses do about $15 billion in sales a year on TikTok. And TikTok and Discord have been critical to documenting human rights abuses, and organizing protests, such as recently in Nepal. There’s many times more young people in the US and around the world on Discord (614 million users) and on TikTok (2 billion users) than who are watching 60 Minutes (about 8 million viewers) so, of course the dominionists want to dominate it. And whatever other platforms they can get their filthy paws on, to better control every sphere of American life. Oh did they throw Jimmy Kimmel off the air, “indefinitely”? They did that last night too, with the FCC threatening that ABC’s broadcast license was in danger after Kimmel criticized the regime’s response to the assassination of Charlie Kirk.

Nvidia (NVDA), the world's largest public company by market cap, said it will invest $5 billion in Intel (INTC) and work with the chipmaker on developing custom data-center and PC products as artificial intelligence becomes more pervasive. AI crypto tokens rose on the news. The Santa Clara, California-based maker of the graphic processing units (GPUs) that underpin AI computing will buy shares of its neighbor at $23.28 each, 6.5% lower than Wednesday's closing price of $24.90, according to an announcement on Thursday. NEAR, the largest AI crypto token by market cap, climbed to over $2.95, its highest in a month, gaining more than 10% in 24 hours. TAO advanced 5.75% and FET 6.75%, outperforming the broader crypto market. The CoinDesk 20 Index added 3.41%. While Nvidia is known for its GPU production, Intel was a leader in developing microprocessors and entered public consciousness as the provider of central processing units (CPUs) that drove IBM-compatible microcomputers. Its fortunes have declined as AI, with its intensive computing requirements, has taken root. Intel stock surged 24% on Thursday, taking its market cap to $143 billion. That's just a fraction of the $500 billion it boasted in 2000, according to companiesmarketcap.com. Nvidia, with a value of $4.23 trillion, rose 1.85%. The U.S. government bought a 10% stake in Intel last month for $8.9 billion in an attempt to shore up the future of American chip manufacturing. The crypto industry watches Nvidia's performance with a keen eye as a proxy for market sentiment, which may reflect in AI tokens and the broader crypto market. UPDATE (Sept. 18, 14:26 UTC): Adds AI crypto tokens' performance in third paragraph.

Ethereum ($ETH) is under the spotlight after Fundstrat’s Tom Lee reiterated his bullish stance, stating that $ETH could reach $5.5K by mid-October. He further added that both Bitcoin and Ethereum could make a ‘monster move’ in the next three months. Lee explained that the driver for this price rise will be the Federal Reserve’s expected monetary easing, including the 0.25% rate cut. He believes that this liquidity injection will primarily benefit Bitcoin and Ethereum, making them the biggest winners of the Fed’s new policy. Alongside $ETH, $XRP is also drawing attention, with the upcoming launch of the REX-Osprey $XRP ETF (under the ticker XRPR). Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, says XRPR will be a ‘litmus test’ of investor demand for traditional spot $XRP ETFs. These developments also highlight why early opportunities in emerging projects like Best Wallet Token ($BEST) and SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) place them among the best crypto to invest in now. On September 17, 2025, the SEC approved rule changes that simplify the listing process for spot crypto ETFs, marking a significant regulatory milestone that opens the door for spot ETFs. Before this rule, every exchange had to file an individual 19b-4 rule change application for each new spot crypto ETF, resulting in long timelines and delays. This made matters more complicated for smaller players as issuers and exchanges needed legal teams and months of lobbying to get approvals. The new SEC rule paves the path for $XRP ETF approval, which was in regulatory limbo despite strong market demand. On the other hand, Fundstrat MD and Head of Technical Strategy Mark Newton’s bullish forecast of $ETH reaching $5.5K was absorbed by the market, alongside news of the SEC’s ETF rule change, which strengthened the positive momentum. Moreover, these developments lower barriers for retail on-ramps, reduce regulatory friction, and create opportunities for emerging altcoins like $BEST and $SUBBD – and OGs like $ETH – to shine. Read on to discover why these are the best crypto to invest in now. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the core power behind the Best Wallet app, a next-generation, multi-chain, non-custodial crypto hot wallet designed to dominate Web3 and beyond. As a utility token, $BEST offers an edge, giving real cost savings, presale access, and iGaming-fueled rewards all within the Best ecosystem. USPs of $BEST include: $BEST is currently priced at $0.025655, while the listing price has been set at $0.0225. So the presale gives early adopters a competitive edge. If you invested $100 in $BEST today, it could grow to approximately $137.26 by the end of 2025 through price appreciation. When factoring in the token’s generous 83% staking APY, you could reap roughly $251.19, a 151% gain by year-end. The presale has already raised $15.9M+, with traction already proving a strong demand and high staking returns. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) offers one of the most attractive upside profiles among utility tokens this year. $SUBBD powers an AI-driven Web3 content creator platform, providing fans with access to premium content, exclusive drops, and direct creator interactions. Considering the content creator economy could reach $480B by 2027, according to Goldman Sachs estimates, this gives $SUBBD the potential to be among the strongest plays of 2025. SUBBD is a platform for creators and fans alike, with attractive perks for both. As a creator, you’ll have access to an AI assistant for chats, scheduling, editing, and monetization. The ecosystem enables frictionless global payments in crypto and fiat, and cuts out the need for costly middlemen – like agents. Meanwhile, as a fan, holding $SUBBD means AI-enhanced interactions, discounts, and access to exclusive content, as well as AI tools. You can also stake your tokens for 20% APY and unlock rewards, beta features, and more. That attractive blend of AI and content creation has seen $SUBBD raise $1.1M+ through its presale, with no signs of momentum slowing. $SUBBD’s current price is $0.05645, although the next price rise is expected in less than three days. Early adopters can also secure a fixed staking APY of 20% for the first year, after which staking transitions to a platform benefit model, rewarding active ecosystem participation. According to our $SUBBD Price Prediction guide, $SUBBD could reach $0.438 by the end of 2025, representing an upside of around 676% for early adopters. If you invest $100 in $SUBBD today, that investment could grow to around $775.90 by the end of 2025 purely from price appreciation. Additionally, the 20% staking APY would yield an extra $20 in rewards, bringing the total to approximately $795.90. Learn how to buy SUBBD Token here. This combination of explosive growth potential, steady staking returns, and early-stage entry makes SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) one of the most compelling high-upside crypto opportunities in 2025. Currently trading at around $4.5K, Ethereum ($ETH) is predicted to reach $5.5K by mid-October. Analysts attribute the price drive to rising institutional inflows, increased ETF demand, technical breakouts, and a high percentage of $ETH supply being staked. $ETH’s trading volume has shot up by 27% in the past 24 hours, reaching $47.6B, and its market cap is up by 1.6%, reaching $552B. CoinMarketCap users are also considering an upside of $4.7K to $4.8K for Ethereum, if it holds at $4.5K. BlackRock buying $25.4M Ethereum is also fueling a potential market rally for $ETH, and we’re likely to see more upside in the near future. Furthermore, macroeconomic factors like the Fed rate cuts, regulatory clarity, and accelerating stablecoin adoption could add to the bullish momentum. Buy your $ETH on Binance and other leading exchanges, while $BEST and $SUBBD can be bought from their official websites. This isn’t financial advice. The cryptocurrency market can be highly volatile. Always do your own research before making any investments.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CrowdStrike stock (NASDAQ: CRWD) has seen six consecutive days of gains, with a cumulative return of 5.2%. The stock continued to rise in extended trading on September 17 after the company’s recent Fal.Con 2025 conference. At the conference, CrowdStrike announced its focus on "securing the AI revolution" and set an ambitious goal of reaching $20 billion in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) by fiscal year 2036. The company also provided specific financial targets for fiscal year 2027, including over 20% net new ARR growth and a non-GAAP operating margin of 24% or more. These announcements, combined with some recent price target increases from Wall Street analysts, have contributed to the stock’s rally. In fact, the company has increased in value by approximately $5.8 billion over the last six days, bringing its current market value to around $111 billion. The stock is currently 30.2% higher than its value at the conclusion of 2024. This is in contrast to year-to-date returns of 12.2% for the S&P 500. CRWD offers cloud-based protection for endpoints, cloud workloads, identity, and data through its subscription-based Falcon platform and modules via direct sales and channel partners. Following this surge, is CRWD still a worthwhile investment – or is it time to secure profits? Explore further with Buy or Sell CRWD. The table below highlights the returns for CRWD stock compared to the S&P 500 index over various periods, including the ongoing streak: What is the point? Momentum frequently comes before conviction. A multi-day winning streak may indicate rising investor confidence or incite additional purchasing. Keeping track of such trends can assist you in capitalizing on the strength or getting ready for a timely entry if the momentum wanes. Nonetheless, large profits can lead to sharp reversals – but how has CRWD performed following previous declines? View CRWD Dip Buyer Analysis to discover more. Currently, there are 33 S&P constituents that have experienced 3 or more days of consecutive gains and 60 constituents with 3 or more days of consecutive losses. While CRWD stock appears appealing due to its winning streak, investing in a single stock without comprehensive and careful analysis can entail risks. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is that? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a less turbulent investment experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Nvidia will take a $5 billion stake in Intel, joining the US government as a major shareholder | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Nvidia said on Thursday that it would buy $5 billion worth of Intel’s common stock, becoming another major shareholder in the beleaguered company just weeks after the US government took a roughly 10% stake. The tech giant, which makes artificial intelligence chips, will pay $23.28 per share, it said in a joint press release. The purchase will give Nvidia around 4% or more of Intel after new shares are issued to complete the deal, Reuters reported. Intel shares (INTC) surged 22.77% on Thursday and posted their biggest single-day gain since 1987. Nvidia shares (NVDA), meanwhile, gained 3.49%. Last month, US President Donald Trump and Intel announced that the government was making an $8.9 billion investment in Intel’s common stock, with Trump calling it “a Great American Company that has an even more incredible future.” “This is a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL,” Trump wrote on Truth Social at the time. The investment is part of the Trump administration’s efforts to boost semiconductor manufacturing in the United States and cement America’s position as a leader in the global chipmaking industry. Trump has said that he plans to impose 100% tariffs on imported semiconductors, excluding suppliers that have committed to building products in the United States. Although Intel was once one of America’s most important tech companies, it has fallen behind rivals after failing to anticipate successive technology waves. Lip-Bu Tan, who took over as CEO in March, has been attempting to turn the company around. The two tech companies also announced that they would jointly develop custom data center and personal computing products. Analysts at Wedbush Securities said the overall agreement was “a game-changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game.” “Today’s announcement further strengthens the US lead in the AI arms race against China as Intel now goes from a laggard to a catalyst,” they wrote in a note.

Stock futures are sharply higher after the Federal Reserve delivered its first interest rate cut of the year; Intel (INTC) shares are soaring on news that AI investor favorite Nvidia (NVDA) will invest $5 billion in the beleaguered chipmaker; Meta Platforms (META) revealed its AI-powered glasses; and StubHub (STUB) stock is pointing lower after shares in the ticket reseller fell in their first trading session. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are soaring as investors digest the Federal Reserve's decision yesterday to cut its benchmark rate and the economic projections of Fed officials. Futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up more than 1% this morning, while those linked to the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were also solidly higher. The major indexes are on track to open at all-time highs, after turning in a mixed performance yesterday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, was down slightly at 4.06%. Bitcoin is at $117,200, trading at its highest levels in a month, while gold futures fell slightly to $3,700 an ounce. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday delivered the quarter percentage point interest rate cut that investors expected, but Chair Jerome Powell couldn’t guarantee that more were on the way. Fed officials on average expect two more rate cuts in the Fed's remaining two meetings of the year, but Powell said those projections were dependent on upcoming economic data releases. Meanwhile, the Fed’s economic outlook projected moderate growth, stable unemployment, and slowing inflation, with officials split on how aggressively to cut interest rates at upcoming meetings. Nvidia (NVDA) will invest $5 billion in embattled rival Intel (INTC) as the two tech firms agreed to jointly develop chips for personal computers and data centers. As part of the agreement, Intel will build custom processing units that Nvidia will integrate into its AI infrastructure, while it will also integrate Nvidia chips into its personal computers. “This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel’s CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem — a fusion of two world-class platforms,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. The move comes after the federal government took a 10% stake in Intel. Shares of Intel were up about 30% in recent premarket trading, while Nvidia shares added 3%. Meta Platforms (META) on Wednesday unveiled new AI-powered glasses as part of its developer conference. CEO Mark Zuckerberg demonstrated the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which the company said “takes microphones, speakers, cameras, and a full-color display backed with compute and AI — and puts it all together in a single device that’s stylish and comfortable.” The device also comes with the Meta Neural Band wrist monitor that tracks movements to help control the glasses. The glasses will be priced at $799, the company said. Meta shares were little change in premarket trading. Ticket reseller StubHub (STUB) shares fell in their first session of trading yesterday after its initial public offering. StubHub priced shares at $23.50, and the stock climbed to above $26 during the session before closing at $22. StubHub sold 34 million shares and raised $800 million in the IPO. The money will go toward paying down debt, CEO Eric Baker said on CNBC. StubHub shares were down 2% ahead of the bell on Thursday.

ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. It finally happened. After months of pressure from President Donald Trump, the Federal Reserve eased interest rates Wednesday. The central bank slashed the federal funds rate by a quarter-point to between 4% and 4.25%, and said it expects two more cuts by the end of the year amid concerns about a weakening labor market. In a note, Fitch Ratings’ head of U.S. economic research called the decision “lift-off” for a “decisively aggressive cutting cycle.” For consumers, lower interest rates mean cheaper borrowing costs and a potential drop in mortgage rates. Crypto could even get a boost, as some Americans could opt for riskier assets to earn a greater yield. ABC pulled Jimmy Kimmel Live! from the air Wednesday due to the host’s comments about conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Shortly before the Disney-owned broadcaster made the announcement, media company Nexstar, which owns a number of local ABC affiliates, said it would preempt the late-night talk show. The decision comes as Nexstar seeks FCC approval for its $6.2 billion acquisition of TEGNA, which would give it the largest share of local TV stations in the U.S. After three failed efforts to take StubHub public, cofounder Eric Baker finally got his wish Wednesday as the online ticket marketplace began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Based on its $23.50 per share listing price, the company is valued at $8.6 billion, giving Baker an estimated net worth of $800 million. Shares of Lyft reached a three-year high as the rideshare firm announced a partnership with Waymo that will bring the autonomous ride-hailing service to Nashville. Waymo is looking to grow the market for its robotaxi rides, and has received $12 billion in investments from parent company Alphabet and others. Meta’s share price rose in premarket trading this morning after it showed off a new pair of AI-powered smart glasses at the company's Meta Connect keynote Wednesday night. The new Meta Ray-Ban Display will be able to read messages, receive video calls and follow map directions on its right lens. The glasses will be available September 30 and cost $799. A new climate economy is advancing in spite of threats to stall its progress, fueled by record clean energy investment, China’s green-tech boom, and a worldwide surge in renewable power. The second Forbes Sustainability Leaders list honors 50 individuals setting the pace for a just, sustainable economy and defining what climate leadership looks like today. MORE: Among the list’s honorees is billionaire Wendy Schmidt: She and her husband, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, have directed a significant portion of their $2 billion in lifetime giving toward environmental initiatives. The stakes for private science funding have never been higher, with Donald Trump back in the White House and a second wave of federal rollbacks targeting climate funding and scientific independence. A small Israeli startup is stress testing AI models for giants like OpenAI and Anthropic to evaluate their capacity for malicious hacking, as the industry grapples with AI misuse. On Wednesday, the startup, which is changing its name to Irregular, announced $80 million in new funding, valuing it at $450 million. As ICE builds up its arsenal of equipment like tactical gear, guns and surveillance kits, contract records show the agency spent $78,000 on a robot capable of opening doors, climbing stairs and firing off smoke bombs during house raids. The contracts, along with purchases of drones and AI-powered facial recognition technology, have raised concerns about ICE’s spending on surveillance and arms that could be used to target the immigrant population. The CDC’s immunization advisory committee—whose membership Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. purged in June and replaced with people more aligned with his anti-vaccine views—is slated to meet starting today. On the agenda, a topic crucial to the health of the country and its pharma industry: childhood vaccinations, as well as Covid-19 shots. Since his appointment, Kennedy has been pushing anti-vaccine policies at the federal level and this meeting could prove critical for U.S. immunization policy going forward. Already, he has announced plans to award a no-bid contract to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to “investigate” long-debunked links between vaccines and autism, and appointed committee members like Retsef Levi and Robert Malone, who have been outspoken opponents of Covid vaccines, which saved an estimated 14.4 million lives the first year after they were made available, and Catherine Stein, who has argued against vaccine mandates. All of this puts pharmaceutical companies into uncharted territory. Vaccines are a big business: Grand View Research estimates the global vaccine market reached $88 billion last year, with the U.S. accounting for the major share of it. They’re also a safe business: Many vaccines have been around for decades, and regulations around them have been both relatively certain and grounded in evidence. That may no longer be the case. On Friday, shares of the biggest Covid-19 vaccine makers fell dramatically when Trump Administration health officials indicated they were investigating unsubstantiated reports of child deaths from the vaccine. WHY IT MATTERS The United States’ childhood immunization program is widely recognized as one of the greatest achievements of public health. It eradicated measles in the U.S. by the year 2000, slashed the infection rate of hepatitis B by 99%, and turned whooping cough into a rarity. Any weakening of recommendations for childhood immunizations could lead to fewer shots, and even a 10% drop in childhood vaccinations could lead to millions of hospitalizations and tens of thousands of deaths among the nation’s children, according to a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. MORE Trump Administration’s Attack On MRNA Vaccines Threatens American Biotech Dominance French luxury conglomerate Kering, parent of brands such as Gucci and Alexander McQueen, confirmed that customer data was stolen in an April cyberattack, potentially impacting millions. It’s the latest luxury company to fall victim to cybercriminals: 7.4 million: The number of unique email addresses hacker group Shiny Hunters, which claimed credit for the breach, told the BBC that it had Over $10,000, up to $86,000: The amount spent by Kering customers in sample records the BBC reviewed, which contained their names and phone numbers 16%: The sales decline Kering reported in the first half of 2025 Everyone faces hardship in life, but it’s important to find ways to stay true to who you are even amid the most difficult of times. Embrace the cycle of struggle and rebirth, and focus your identity on your strengths—rather than just what you do for work. Lastly, create a sense of urgency around your goals to ensure you don’t procrastinate.

Title: From $2 Trillion To $400T? CEO Sees Bitcoin Exploding 200x – Here’s More

Jack Mallers, co-founder and CEO of Twenty One Capital, told NYSE TV that he expects Bitcoin to climb much higher from current levels. According to Mallers, the size of global wealth available for savings gives Bitcoin room to grow in a big way. He made the bold remark that Bitcoin could be “100 to 200 times from here,” and his firm’s buying behavior appears to follow that view. According to Mallers, total global wealth across assets like stocks, property, gold and art is about $900 trillion. He argued roughly $400–500 trillion of that is used mainly as savings. Right now, Mallers said, Bitcoin’s market value sits near $2 trillion. At the price cited in reports — about $115,570 per coin — he sees a path for dramatic expansion if Bitcoin captures only a slice of that savings market. Jack Mallers says, “#Bitcoin will 200x from here.” “Bitcoin is going after a $400-500 trillion market, and it’s only $2 trillion.” pic.twitter.com/urpR8HelFO — Maestro (@GoMaestroOrg) September 16, 2025 Reports have disclosed that since April, Twenty One Capital has acquired 43,514 BTC, a haul worth roughly $5 billion at current prices. The firm has backing from players such as Tether, Bitfinex, and SoftBank, and it plans to merge with SPAC Cantor Equity Partners to pursue a public listing. Mallers’ team has been buying aggressively, and the stash already exceeded the firm’s initial target by about 1,500 BTC. Several high-profile figures have also made bullish calls, and their forecasts are often cited alongside Mallers’ views. According to public remarks, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has suggested Bitcoin could reach $700,000. Anthony Scaramucci of SkyBridge has said he expects Bitcoin to hit about $200,000 by the end of 2025. Bill Barhydt, CEO of Abra Global, has outlined a base-case of $350,000 and a more aggressive scenario as high as $700,000. These estimates differ in timing and method, but they share a common theme: large upside is possible if demand and adoption keep rising. Based on reports, Mallers’ firm is joining a larger group of companies that hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Michael Saylor’s Strategy has accumulated 638,985 BTC — a figure that dwarfs most other corporate treasuries and is valued near $74 billion. Mining companies such as MARA Holdings hold about 52,477 BTC. One important contrast is funding approach: Strategy leaned on debt to build its position, while Twenty One Capital has avoided that route so far. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Time Published: 2025-09-18T11:00:00Z

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) today announced a collaboration to jointly develop multiple generations of custom data center and PC products that accelerate applications and workloads across hyperscale, enterprise and consumer markets. The companies will focus on seamlessly connecting NVIDIA and Intel architectures using NVIDIA NVLink — integrating the strengths of NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing with Intel’s leading CPU technologies and x86 ecosystem to deliver cutting-edge solutions for customers. For data centers, Intel will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that NVIDIA will integrate into its AI infrastructure platforms and offer to the market. For personal computing, Intel will build and offer to the market x86 system-on-chips (SOCs) that integrate NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets. These new x86 RTX SOCs will power a wide range of PCs that demand integration of world-class CPUs and GPUs. NVIDIA will invest $5 billion in Intel’s common stock at a purchase price of $23.28 per share. The investment is subject to customary closing conditions, including required regulatory approvals. “AI is powering a new industrial revolution and reinventing every layer of the computing stack — from silicon to systems to software. At the heart of this reinvention is NVIDIA’s CUDA architecture,” said NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang. “This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel’s CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem — a fusion of two world-class platforms. Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.” “Intel’s x86 architecture has been foundational to modern computing for decades — and we are innovating across our portfolio to enable the workloads of the future,” said Lip-Bu Tan, CEO of Intel. “Intel’s leading data center and client computing platforms, combined with our process technology, manufacturing and advanced packaging capabilities, will complement NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing leadership to enable new breakthroughs for the industry. We appreciate the confidence Jensen and the NVIDIA team have placed in us with their investment and look forward to the work ahead as we innovate for customers and grow our business.” Press Conference: The CEOs of NVIDIA and Intel will conduct a webcast press conference at 10 a.m. Pacific time (1 p.m. Eastern time) today to discuss the announcement.

Title: US stock market futures rise today after Fed rate cut with Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit record highs — top pre-market gainers and losers to watch today

U.S. stock market futures rose today following the Federal Reserve's rate cut, with all three major indexes climbing in early trading. The Fed lowered interest rates by 25 basis points, marking its first cut of the year, and signaled the possibility of two more cuts in 2025, boosting investor sentiment. The rate cut helped lift optimism in sectors poised to benefit from lower borrowing costs, especially tech stocks, which contributed to the Nasdaq's stronger futures gain. The small-cap Russell 2000 futures also rose significantly, expected to thrive in a lower interest rate environment.

Title: Tether, Tokenization Pioneers Unveil STBL Protocol Splitting Principal From Yield
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/09/18/tether-tokenization-pioneers-unveil-startup-focused-on-genius-aligned-digital-dollars
Time Published: 2025-09-18T10:21:38Z

Traditional finance has long had a way of splitting capital from coupons, allowing investors to separate interest-payment flows from the principal. Now, a team of stablecoin and blockchain-based real-world asset (RWA) pioneers is doing the same for tokenized assets. A new startup, STBL, emulates TradFi's zero-coupon strip structures by converting digital assets into a dollar-pegged stablecoin and yield-bearing non-fungible token (NFT). Just as with the traditional equivalent, the components can be held separately, allowing investors to keep the part that appeals to them and sell the other bit to counterparties with different attitudes to risk. The product, currently in beta testing, goes beyond just packaging risk into different tranches. It also widens the stablecoin issuance model. With regular stablecoins, like USDT, the issuing company, in this case Tether, keeps the returns on the Treasuries they hold to maintain the token's peg to the dollar. It's profitable business, Tether reported $4.9 billion net profit in the second quarter. With STBL, whoever deposits a tokenized asset into the system becomes the minter and keeps the returns. “Our mission at STBL is to evolve stablecoins from corporate products into public infrastructure,” said STBL co-founder Reeve Collins, who was also a cofounder of Tether. “For the first time, minters, not issuers, retain the value of reserves. This is the defining shift of Stablecoin 2.0: money that is stable, compliant, and built to serve the community.” When a yield-bearing on-chain asset — this could be any yield-bearing RWA, such as Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, BlackRock’s BUIDL or Ondo’s USDY — is deposited and locked into the STBL protocol, it splits into a stablecoin (USST) that can circulate and serve as collateral or reserves in decentralized finance (DeFi) and a separate, yield-accruing non-fungible token (NFT) called YLD. The design is intended to remain a non-security in spirit and align with the U.S. GENIUS Act and other regulatory frameworks by separating principal from yield, said CEO Avtar Sehra, who is also a co-founder of the project and was CEO and founder of Kaio (formerly Libre Capital). “When a user who’s already whitelisted with a Franklin Templeton or BlackRock fund locks that asset into STBL, they receive an NFT that controls the vault,” Sehra said in an interview. “You hold the NFT and accrue interest, while the stable asset can be used as collateral, as reserves, or to mint an ecosystem-specific stablecoin aligned with GENIUS Act requirements.” In the year or so before STBL started up, Sehra and Collins were looking at how RWAs or tokenized securities could be used in DeFi; asking how they worked as collateral; how money market funds became the reserves for minting stablecoins, and so on. There had been a view that wrapping an asset, that is taking a tokenized security and placing it into a vault, meant the asset no longer counted as a security as far as U.S. regulations were concerned. But it's not clear that wrapping something "deviates from or extracts the security-like essence" of the asset, Sehra said. To ensure the USST stablecoin component isn't viewed as a security required a mechanism to maintain the dollar peg. This is achieved by ensuring it is slightly over collateralized coupled with an incentive system related to mint fees and burn credits should deviation happen in a volatile market. Sehra referred to STBL's peg-maintenance system as “synthetic” rather than “algorithmic.” “The reason I call it a synthetic is because, even though it has this interest-rate algorithmic component to it, it is 103% over collateralized with pure money market assets,” he said. “As a result of this novel structure, eligible participants that hold permitted RWAs can mint and burn compliant stablecoins. So while minters can hold the yield, the stable asset can be openly used without breaking the non-yield bearing requirements of the GENIUS Act. That's exactly how STBL operates.” The protocol’s decentralized governance token, also called STBL, has been added to Binance Alpha, Binance Futures and Kraken Spot, and will list on other spot exchanges soon, Sehra said. The Sept. 16 debut of the STBL governance token has been lauded as one of the most successful token generating events of 2025, Sehra added. It launched at $100 million fully diluted value, and demand pushed it over $1 billion. It is currently at $1.3 billion, having hit an all time high of about $2.3 billion within 24 hours. The next steps involve a $100 million minting using Franklin Templeton’s BENJI token, Sehra said, and also the announcement of several other partnerships, including with a U.S. based payments firm. The protocol is due to open to the public in the fourth quarter.UPDATE (Sept. 19, 11:46 UTC): Rewrites headline to remove ambiguity.

Title: How Micron Stock Surges 2x To $300
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/18/how-micron-stock-surges-2x-to-300/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Micron Technology stock (NASDAQ:MU) has increased approximately 80% from about $87 at the beginning of 2025 to nearly $157, reaching all-time highs in the process. So, what is driving this increase for Micron? It all revolves around the demand for AI infrastructure, which is boosting sales of high-bandwidth memory products, also referred to as HBM. Even after this substantial rally, Micron stock is valued at about 20× estimated earnings for 2025. Projected growth looks robust: expected revenues are set to rise by 48% this fiscal year, based on consensus estimates, while growth is anticipated at roughly 31% for FY’26. Given this strong growth paired with a reasonable valuation, could Micron stock potentially double to around $300? Below, we outline this scenario. Demand is being propelled by the swift adoption of generative AI, which necessitates high-performance memory to function at scale. While DRAM offers capacity, HBM supplies the bandwidth and low latency required for large language models. Micron serves as a primary supplier for Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell GB200 platform, alongside AMD’s Instinct MI350 series GPUs. The memory requirements for each AI system are also escalating: for example, Nvidia’s latest Blackwell systems feature 33% more memory per node compared to earlier-generation chips. Additionally, as AI models transition from being text-only to incorporating multimodal formats such as video and speech, memory intensity is on the rise. With AI expected to be broadly adopted throughout the economy, Micron is positioned for a prolonged growth trajectory. To illustrate the scale of the investments, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) have indicated that they could collectively invest $364 billion in capital expenditures for their respective current fiscal years. However, supply may not keep pace easily. Manufacturing HBM is more intricate than standard DRAM, and supply levels are still constrained. The production of HBM is wafer-intensive — it requires approximately three times as many wafers as standard DRAM to create the same quantity of bits due to its lower bit density and intricate 3D stacking. This forms a natural bottleneck. Although Micron has been expanding its HBM production capacity, output for 2025 is already sold out, with robust demand anticipated in 2026. Micron aims to significantly increase its HBM market share, targeting about 20 to 25% of the HBM segment by the end of 2025. Beyond HBM, Micron remains the sole volume producer of low-power DRAM for data centers, providing an advantage as AI workloads increasingly emphasize efficiency. Looking forward, even after this increase, Micron does not appear to be overvalued. Its revenues surged by 58%, from $21 billion in 2023 to $34 billion in 2024, as the company rebounded from a downturn. Consensus forecasts indicate revenues climbing from roughly $25.1 billion in FY’24 to $37.1 billion in FY’25, and by about 31% to $48.7 billion in FY’26. HBM has been a significant factor in this growth, with HBM revenue achieving a $6 billion annualized run rate and a projected $10 billion run rate by 2026. Increased HBM production does place pressure on conventional DRAM supply, contributing to rising DRAM prices, which may also enhance revenues for products outside of HBM. If we project a slightly more conservative annual growth rate of 25% between FY’26 and FY’28, Micron could generate approximately $77 billion in revenues by FY’28. Micron's net margins were around 20% over the first nine months of this year. It is possible that this figure could grow further due to a higher proportion of higher-margin HBM chips and improved economies of scale. Assuming net margins rise to about 22% in FY’28, this would equate to net income of approximately $17 billion. With a forward P/E ratio of about 20x, this would imply a market cap of around $340 billion, suggesting the stock price could nearly double from current levels. That said, competition persists. SK Hynix continues to dominate the HBM market with an approximate 50% share and an advantage in production, particularly regarding HBM4. Micron is increasing HBM3E production and testing HBM4, but it is still striving to catch up. HBM4 is anticipated to power Nvidia’s upcoming Rubin architecture for AI accelerators. The memory market has also historically been subject to significant cyclical behavior, and Micron is no exception. DRAM and NAND remain vulnerable to fluctuations in supply and demand along with pricing volatility. At this time, it appears that HBM serves as a partially secular growth driver, with AI infrastructure investments, high profit margins, and strong order visibility providing some degree of protection. Nevertheless, HBM presently comprises less than 20% of total revenues, meaning the company is not entirely insulated from traditional market cycles. Furthermore, AI demand may normalize following years of heavy investment if shareholders start demanding superior returns and more efficient capital management. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as demonstrated in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Hello, Mitsotakis was very careful yesterday in his first interview after the Thessaloniki International Fair on Antenna (with Hatzinikolaou). He dropped the line, for good measure, that it is the people who elect the prime minister and not the power brokers, but I would say he should rather be hoping that… the power brokers do the electing. Because that seems to be the only sure way for him to get re-elected, since these so-called brokers have an unfailing instinct for making the wrong choice! Since 2023 we’ve seen the “ready-made Nikos,” then Kasselakis, now Tsipras stepping down and Dendias stepping in; generally, necessity becomes virtue. I noted carefully that he said nothing about Karamanlis and Samaras, because as we said yesterday…softly, quietly, as they say. KYSEA – Piri Reis M.M. didn’t much like the warlike tone of the leaks about the joint forces exercise of the Armed Forces, which started, as usual, without prior notice, and was linked to the Piri Reis, which still hasn’t left the port of Smyrna. And he especially didn’t like it because it set a harsh tone ahead of the Mitsotakis–Erdogan meeting next week in New York. That meeting seems to be one of the most critical of this period, since it doesn’t have a concrete “deliverable,” unlike other encounters. It remains to be seen whether it will extend (a little) the calm waters, or mark the start of a new escalation phase. A different tone Of course, just before Dendias left M.M. and delivered the quip about how old the Piri Reis is, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Lana Zochiou, who was briefing diplomatic correspondents, was adopting the diplomatic language: “we are monitoring the issue closely” and “Greece safeguards its sovereign rights.” In short, (once again) a different climate between Vasilissis Sofias Avenue and the Pentagon… Let me note two things: first, these little vessels like the Piri Reis were never aircraft carriers for us to fear them, but we all know what their real job is. And second, be careful not to get burned during the warm-up. Ideas about Libya I understand that in yesterday’s KYSEA discussion, when the issue of flows from Libya toward Crete was being analyzed, Plevris among other things said that the scenario of a more dynamic show of force at sea should be evaluated, if arrivals continue. The central idea is that the images of dinghies arriving in Gavdos and Chania are not flattering, so the government may revise its strategy. No decision was taken, and of course it’s not an easy one. Let me also tell you that the minister responsible for the Coast Guard, Vassilis Kikilias, was absent from yesterday’s session due to a scheduled trip abroad. Gerapetritis and the “blue” MPs Around 17:30 yesterday, a friend of mine saw a lot of movement and many cars at New Democracy’s headquarters on Piraeus Street. I asked and found out that Foreign Minister Giorgos Gerapetritis had called, in coordination with ND’s general director Giannis Smyrlis, the ND MPs who sit on the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Participation was almost universal, with 1–2 justified absences, and the discussion lasted more than two hours covering everything. Greek–Turkish relations and Turkey’s broader role, Libya after the announcement of resuming EEZ talks with Tripoli, energy issues, the situation in the Middle East, and the role of the U.S. were all on the table. I’m told the conversation took place in a good climate. After all, if there’s one thing that can be credited to Gerapetritis, it’s that he regularly briefs the parties and, in this case, ND’s MPs. Drought – nightmare – elections Let’s leave current affairs aside now for an issue that, as it unfolds, if not properly assessed and addressed in the next 12–18 months, will explode in the government’s hands, right in the middle of the election period. This is the drought, mainly in the capital. Even with the most optimistic estimates and forecasts—meaning, if it rains or snows more than it did this year and last year—we will just barely make it through 2026, but not 2027. According to experts, the problem is dire. The government has held some talks about whether PPC should take over municipal water companies (or share responsibility), but beyond this the major issue is Athens itself. Immediate solutions are needed there, because as I’m told, they won’t know what to do. Water rationing in Athens in 2026—or 2027? Blackrock and PPC and Athens Airport Let’s leave behind the unpleasant and move on to the pleasant, which are business-related, though they may not materialize, since we’re talking about multibillion-euro deals — and such deals are never easy. So, during these days when Blackrock representatives were in Athens and met with many key officials, they expressed serious investment interest in both PPC (Public Power Corporation) and Athens International Airport “Eleftherios Venizelos.” I find both prospects difficult, not least because they’re not strictly government matters, but still, note the strong interest of a powerful investment organization like Blackrock, which maintains excellent relations with the Trump system in the U.S. The businessmen who go to Dubai for… stem cells And since Piri Reis, drought, Blackrock, etc. are heavy topics, let me switch to something lighter. The entire social scene of Athens, along with certain well-known businessmen, has recently been traveling feverishly to Dubai. Not to enjoy the luxuries the Arab destination has to offer, but because in Dubai they administer stem cell treatments freely, without much procedure or bureaucracy. Stem cell therapies are said to rejuvenate the body and, in any case, are believed to help with everything from baldness and cataracts to osteoporosis and diabetes. Gossip has it that, from the business world, the most frequent travelers to Dubai for stem cell treatments are two prominent and successful businessmen, both residents of the southern suburbs, both known from time to time for their fondness for the opposite sex, and who happen to have very (very) young wives. One is highly successful in the shipping sector and impresses with how well he maintains himself past seventy. The other, nearing seventy, is very successful in commerce and retail, although his company’s stock performance has disappointed shareholders. The U.S. Interior Secretary, Elefsina, and the Great Port The visit of U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum to Greece last week — the first official visit by a member of the new Trump administration to our country — continues to leave ripples. Beyond the official announcements and smiling photo ops, there was also a hidden agenda behind closed doors. Because, as Konstantinos Karamanlis used to say, “there are things that are said but not done, and things that are not said but are done.” Moving on. In small meetings, I hear the American Secretary put on the table the issue of the Port of Piraeus and the Chinese company Cosco. This matter has been simmering for some time, and Doug brought it to the attention of the relevant authorities. I hear the Americans are looking for alternative solutions in logistics and supply chains. It may not be a coincidence that, as we recently reported, the U.S. state development bank DFC, which has already approved a €125 million fund for investments in those shipyards, will also be putting more money into further developing Elefsina. In light of the new perspective on Piraeus, the Americans’ aim through DFC is to make Elefsina a hub supporting shipping, the energy transition through cutting-edge technologies, the allied fleet, and the development of strategic logistics for commercial shipping, defense, and energy. The new Executive Chairman at PPA By the way, I hear from my sources that if not today, then in the coming days, the new Executive Chairman at PPA (Piraeus Port Authority) will be announced. He is already in Greece and intends to sort out outstanding issues at a peculiar time for the port and Cosco, with the Americans lying in wait. I’m also told that the contractually mandated investments have been delayed, and that may well become the next episode in U.S.–China relations. We’ll see. The “renaissance” of Stadiou Street brings Primark The large property on Stadiou Street — once home to the Fokas department store and later earmarked by Brown for conversion into a hotel — has apparently become a “bone of contention.” According to a fashion industry entrepreneur, the Israeli group backed out, leading e-EFKA to plan a restart of the leasing process. Since a hotel-use permit was ultimately not granted for the building, it is considered certain that the potential buyer will come from the broader clothing–fashion sector. This aligns with the “renaissance” of the area (starting from the beginning of Stadiou Street), with the upcoming opening of the Food Center/Arsakeio expected in early December, and the full renovation of Alpha Bank’s buildings (towards Klafthmonos Square) — developments that have not gone unnoticed by entrepreneurs. The same goes for 2–3 foreign brands investing in promoting Athens as a city-break destination and looking for buildings and facilities in the area. Indeed, according to the same entrepreneur, the well-known retail chain Primark has shown investment interest in entering the Greek market, specifically in central Athens (Syntagma–Omonia). The “clouds” and rebranding for Vardas The historic clothing company Vardas is facing a… barrage of foreclosures. Just yesterday, Wednesday, three auctions for company properties (offices, shops) in Pikermi, Chalandri, Kantza, and Thessaloniki were posted on the electronic platform. These auctions, initiated by private creditors (not banks or servicers), are scheduled for October 1 and 30, though they may be suspended before then. More broadly, the emblematic company, active since the late 1930s, is burdened with serious financial problems, like much of the sector due to successive crises. It should be noted that the foreclosures target General Clothing Construction S.A., which is in “liquidation,” with long-time head Theodoros Vardas as liquidator. According to its 2023 financial statements, the company had accumulated losses of €17.13 million, negative equity, and total liabilities of €46.8 million. It “faces liquidity problems and has overdue obligations to the State, which have been restructured and are being paid in installments totaling €1.36 million, while it has exhausted borrowing options since it is heavily indebted, under new agreements, but is not servicing that debt.” Moreover, on September 9, 2024, the company was served with a European Payment Order from the Wedding District Court in Berlin, Germany. “Following this, the company’s bank accounts were frozen and all staff dismissed. Despite this, management intends to continue operations through consignment sales via third parties,” it is stated. At the same time, however, the historic brand recently unveiled new signs as part of its own rebranding and continues to maintain a presence in the market under the name Varda, essentially through N & T Vardas IKE, run by the next generation — Theodoros Vardas’ daughters, Natalia and Tatiana. The company has 12 stores and an e-shop, and reports positive financial results with rising turnover and profits. 110 analysts and fund managers More than 110 analysts and fund managers — a record number, apparently — participated yesterday in an investor call for GEK TERNA’s new bond. It will have a 7-year maturity and is expected to offer an interest rate slightly above 3% (while today Greece’s 7-year sovereign bond yields 2.9%). The company aims to raise €350–500 million, with the public offering starting on Monday, September 23, and the bond scheduled to trade on the Athens Exchange on September 30. The bonds, with a nominal value of €1,000 each, will be covered 30% by retail investors. G. Gouroukos and the €1 million house in “the Village” A friend who was in Kimolos a few days ago overheard a conversation about shipowner Giorgos Gouroukos. According to what he told me, G.Y. bought a large house — a mansion, really — in Chorio. When I asked what the village was called, my friend explained that Kimolos is the only Cycladic island where the Chora (the capital) is referred to as Chorio (“village”). The price is said to have exceeded €1 million. The shipowner appears to have fallen in love with the island. He immediately made socially-minded donations, covering the costs for the restoration of parts of the main school building, while also donating all the air conditioners. I was also told he reached out to the Afentakeio Foundation of Kimolos, which is soon expected to open a Day Care Center for the Elderly. Aegean: The Israelis and cash flow One of Eftichis Vassilakis’ remarks stood out at the close of yesterday’s Aegean conference call with analysts. After stressing that he remains cautiously optimistic about performance in the coming quarters, he focused on the airline’s cash flows. The reference was clear, as Aegean’s stock came under pressure yesterday (closing down 2.84%) because some investors gave more weight to operating performance (flat sales year-on-year, EBITDA -2% annually), which was affected by competition (capacity increase by a significant number of airlines flying to Greece) and the crisis in the Middle East (suspension of flights to Israel, Lebanon, and Jordan in May–June), rather than the net result, which rose 24% year-on-year — mainly due to €22 million in FX gains from the euro’s appreciation against the dollar and lower fuel prices. It should be noted that according to results, net operating cash inflows amounted to €253 million at the end of June, while excluding lease liabilities, the group showed net cash reserves of €424 million at the end of June, up from €385 million at the end of 2024. The key point, however, is that Aegean has ahead of it the traditionally very strong third quarter, which — besides the strengthening euro and low fuel prices — includes peak summer season and, of course, the routes to Tel Aviv, Beirut, Amman, and Erbil, which were gradually restored from mid-July onward after being suspended in Q2 due to events in the region. To give an idea of scale, the airline’s CEO mentioned that Aegean had nine daily flights to that region, plus various connections from Athens to other destinations, all of which were lost during the suspension. Despite the difficulties, Aegean managed revenue growth above the market average in Q2 and now faces what looks like a strong Q3. Demand remains at satisfactory levels, with load factors at 85% in July–August, while average revenue per flight is expected to be only marginally lower in Q3. In this context, NBG Securities maintained its €19.20 price target for Aegean shares with an “outperform” recommendation — about 40% above current levels. Investments in port infrastructure – Priority on Alexandroupolis The newly established Hellenic Innovation & Infrastructure Fund (HIIF), which will act as the investment arm of the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP), has the advantage of enabling the government to push forward major projects implemented by market players and institutions. According to reliable sources, HIIF’s first major move will be in port infrastructure, especially the Port of Alexandroupolis, which seems to be heading towards a major Hub tender. This means the tender will not only include investments in the port but also in the airport and land for logistics. With initial capital of €303 million, HIIF aims to mobilize a total of €1 billion in investments. Why Credia Bank’s stock slipped The Malta Stock Exchange (MSE), headquartered in Valletta at the “Garrison Chapel” in Castille Place, saw HSBC Malta shares fall to an 18-month low of €1.31, as some expected 70% of the bank to be sold for €300 million. The fall of the Maltese bank does not explain yesterday’s sharp drop (-7.64%) in CrediaBank, which had actually managed to pay €200 million for that 70% stake in HSBC Malta. Additionally, Hellenic Bank’s stock is highly concentrated: 57.6% of its share capital is controlled by Thrivest and 36.16% by the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF). Since these two shareholders (93.7%) have no reason to sell and are not generally active in the market at present, yesterday’s decline likely had very short-term goals. After all, CrediaBank’s stock has gained +102% in the past quarter and +128% since the start of the year. TITAN is not doing well It could be due to the sharp slide in the dollar exchange rate (€1 = $1.1850). Or investors’ displeasure at a €75 million net profit loss from the sale of its Turkish subsidiary. Or the unfavorable international geopolitical environment. The fact remains: since February 10, when TITAN’s share hit a high of €45.8, things have worsened. On April 7 (“Black Monday” for markets), the stock plummeted to €35.6, later climbed back to €42.3 on May 28 when it cut a €3/share dividend, but never recovered — now hovering at €36.5. Meanwhile, on the derivatives market, more than 400 contracts are giving an additional discount of about 1% or more. Operating profits for H1 rose slightly (+2%), but group net profits fell sharply due to the loss from selling Adocim in Turkey, higher depreciation, and increased minority rights (Titan America). TITAN has slipped to 14th place on the Athens Stock Exchange in terms of market capitalization (€2.8 billion). A lesson in hesitation and insecurity A sudden order to buy 2.6 million Alpha Bank shares appeared at the end of yesterday’s session and then…disappeared from the terminals within seconds. This is indicative of the mood that prevailed yesterday at the Athens Stock Exchange. Tomorrow marks a triple witching day in the Derivatives Market (September triple witching — futures and options on indices and stocks expire simultaneously). With a lack of strong buying interest from abroad, the market is focused on short-term tactical moves and covering basic needs. Trading activity was high, at €245 million, of which €47 million were pre-agreed block trades. The General Index held the 2,020-point level, closing at -0.67%, but during the session it had alarmed the market with a drop of -1.17%, below 2,010 points. At the close, no banking stock was in positive territory, while among large-cap stocks notable declines included: Aegean -2.84% to €13.7, Ellaktor -1.96%, PPC -1.27% to €14, Elvalhalcor -1.25% to €2.76, Jumbo -1.08% to €31.4, and OPAP -0.97% to €19.48. Metlen reacted with gains of +0.60% to €52.7. The burden of private debt weighs on the Trump administration The U.S. federal debt exceeds $37 trillion. Household debt, however, has reached a record $18.7 trillion. This means that each adult in the U.S. owes about $63,000. Official data show that consumer loans surged by $16 billion in July, reaching $5.06 trillion. Over the past five months, consumer credit has increased by $103 billion. Revolving debt (credit cards) rose by $10 billion to $1.31 trillion, the highest since November 2024. Non-revolving credit, which includes auto loans and student loans, rose by $6 billion, reaching a record $3.75 trillion. The proportion of loans more than 90 days past due is increasing, especially in credit card and student loan debt. Notably, 10.2% of total student debt is over 90 days delinquent, based on Q2 2025 data. Explore related questions

Title: Why It’s Hard for Activists and Blockholders to Make a Difference in Banking

Full Content:
Activist investors and blockholders are unable to restructure and turnaround poorly performing banks, making it unlikely that they can enhance bank performance and contribute to financial stability. We argue that regulation and supervision hinder the flow of information needed to price risk effectively and as a result weaken the incentive and ability of activists and blockholders to turnaround poorly performing banks. We identify bank opacity due to regulation and supervision as the main cause of weak market discipline by banks (see Mehran and Spatt, 2024).[1] In a previous post, we noted that the regulatory environment in banking interferes with information production as disclosure of some information may be perceived by regulators as potentially causing bank runs. Weak market discipline due to regulation and supervision fuels the control market in bank restructuring, thus leading to larger institutions. In this post, we draw on examples of large investors in the banking industry. In 1989, American businessman Laurence Tisch and his family acquired 8.9 percent of the Bank of Boston. In 1990, they made further disclosures of large investments in Continental Bank, Baybank, and Equimark. Each of these institutions had lost nearly 70 percent of its value following the savings and loan (S&L) crisis.[2] The share acquisitions by the Tisch family were the largest percentage investment in large, regional banks by individual investors and institutions at the time. The media reported in 1991 that the family reduced its investments in two of the banks,[3] selling the investments at a loss. The Tisch family was not the only sophisticated investor to incur losses investing in bank stocks during a crisis. American hedge fund manager Bill Ackman invested about $1 billion in Citigroup for his firm, Pershing Square, following the 2007–2009 financial crisis. He concluded that Citigroup had already written down its bad loans and thus the bank’s stock price might be fair or even undervalued. Yet, the investment produced a loss of $400 million (see Partnoy and Eisinger, 2013).[4] The Tisch and Ackman losses were not exceptions.[5] Investments in bank assets during crises are often underperforming (see Baron et al., 2021).[6] Bank charter value can dissipate when banks are in difficulty, even outside a crisis. Surprisingly, quickly restoring value even by a capital infusion or by changing the bank’s management is not easy. (The demise of the New York Community Bank provides a recent example.) Once risk is priced and opacity is partly removed, even government protection is not likely to bring back a bank’s lost charter value (at least in the short term). Equally important is that news of large, sophisticated investments in banks often has a muted price impact. While blockholders have invested in weak banks, their presence is uncommon, and their impact is inconsequential. This is contrary to the view that, to protect their stake, large investors could be effective monitors and might exert pressure on management in poorly performing firms and influence firm corporate policies (see Shleifer and Vishny, 1986).[7] Yet, investors have little influence on corporate restructuring and other bank policies, particularly during a crisis period. The focus of corporate restructuring is often about assets, capital structure, and labor, approaches which are not mutually exclusive. Any change in these methods, particularly in acquisition and disposition of assets, takes time and could require regulatory approval (see Adams and Mehran, 2003).[8] Potential acquirers are likely to opt out if they think that they might face regulatory opposition on quick asset restructuring. Blockholders also are less willing to invest in a share of a bank if they cannot get a fair assessment of the value of the company. The loss-sharing agreement of failed banks between acquirers and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) supports this argument (see Bennett and Unal, 2014).[9] Bank valuation is hardly accurate as risk often is not effectively priced. Remaining unclear is whether regulators are aware of bank weak spots and, if they are, whether they would undertake corrective actions [see (Gallemore, 2016)[10] and (Mehran and Spatt, 2024)[11]]. Thus, the nature of bank assets and the role of regulation and supervision imply that very few blockholders invest in banks and attempt to turn around banking firms while they are in difficulty. The implication is that market discipline in banks would not benefit from the presence of sophisticated activist investors, unlike for non-financial companies (see Haubrich and Thomson, 1998).[12] Another regulatory hurdle might seem to weaken the ability of blockholders and activist investors to control the banking firm’s operation. The reason was noted in the Tisch family disclosure: The purpose behind acquiring a large block of shares in the banks was purely for investment and not for control. The statement of purpose for investment was intentional as the banking rule at the time prohibited investments of more than 5 percent if the intent were to control the bank. Also, blockholders were required to contact the Federal Reserve Board for any additional investments beyond 5 percent. Investment beyond 5 percent with control intent effectively invites supervision of the investors by the Federal Reserve. Allowing regulators to examine investors’ financial data and being subject to supervision arguably is a big deterrent to becoming a large blockholder in a bank, particularly when it might be difficult to prove the intent as discussed later. The cutoff, while set arbitrarily, was intended to ensure the stability of bank operations in the presence of activist investors. Ensuring operational stability and preventing potential abuse through ownership control is also an issue in other settings, as when thrift institutions convert from mutual to stock ownership (see Cole and Mehran, 1998).[13] Thus, blockholders’ ability and incentive to pressure management is limited, and the reward from doing so might be insufficient partly due to the banking rule on control. The 5 percent cutoff could be considered small, if investors’ desire to redirect the bank’s strategic direction or force out the management team. The Federal Reserve Board changed the cutoff to 10 percent on January 30, 2020.[14] The objective was to improve the flow of investment in bank equity and thus enhance banking firms’ capital. In the same spirit, following the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC allowed private equity firms to invest in equity of distressed banks (see Ross, et al., 2021).[15] Overall, which group of banks, large versus small, is most likely to be affected by the control rule, if at all, is unclear. To study the market assessment of lifting the ownership cutoff to 10 percent, we conducted an event study. An announcement effect was estimated for listed banks from March 29 to March 30, 2020. Five groups were created based on bank book-asset size at the end of the last quarter of 2019, and announcement returns were calculated for banks in each group. If weaker banks were insulated from market discipline, lifting the control threshold to 10 percent would make it easier for activists to influence governance of banks, and the gain would likely to be captured in equity prices. The announcement effect for the three groups with the largest book-assets is significant and positive, while banks in the two small asset groups suffered losses. Explaining the findings is difficult, particularly in the case of small banks. If the rise in the cutoff would have increased the likelihood of acquisition of small banks, then their stock price should have increased due to the present value of the acquisition premium. The loss then could be the result of interference on bank operations by future activist investors. The gain to large banks is likely due to potential merger and acquisitions and new investments in bank equity. Although there are reports of block acquisitions in small and community banks since the 2020 relaxation of the control role, there is little evidence of significant share acquisitions of large banks. Also, while 217 instances of activism were reported between 2019 and 2024, only a few large institutions were a target, such as Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, and State Street. Bank of America agreed to some minor changes in its governance. The other institutions are in effect custodians with very little commercial banking activities, and they agreed to some cost cutting (see for example, Benoit, 2014).[16] Activist investors have little influence in large banks in Europe as well (see Sweney and Makortoff, 2021).[17] Overall, most activist investors have targeted small and community banks (see Graf, 2023).[18] As expected, most of the demands of activist investors are for changes in governance rather than operations of banks (see Graf and Clark, 2024).[19] Thus, in light of the influence of regulators and supervisors on bank governance, the potential impact of activist investors on bank performance and stability is likely limited. This is not the case for activist investors in non-financial firms (see Gow, et al. (2023).[20] Thus, activist investors in banking probably are just as uninformed about their ability to influence bank governance as they are about the potential for windfall gains in distressed bank stocks, at least in the short term. The takeaway is that regulation and supervision are the most likely reasons that large investors are unable to influence bank operations. Institutional investors hold most of banks’ equity, and the trend is continuing. For example, at the end of 2024, institutions held about 76 percent of the shares of large banks in the U.S., and the percentage is higher for the largest commercial banks. Among the largest holders are BlackRock and Vanguard, which hold large blocks of shares in major banks, such as JPMorgan Chase. Vanguard held 9.74 percent, and BlackRock 6.89 percent at the end of 2024, according to a 2025 proxy filing with SEC. Both institutions held more than the control threshold of 5 percent in the bank at the end of 2019. While below the 10 percent threshold, these holdings raised concerns among regulators about the potential influence of large institutional investors to control and thus direct bank governance in ways that might be anticompetitive or even adversely affect the goal of financial stability. The FDIC, for example, reached an agreement with Vanguard on investment passivity last year.[21] The consequences of high institutional ownership on bank conduct are complex. Institutional ownership induces common ownership. While common ownership is considered very large in the banking industry, there is no evidence that it is anticompetitive (see Gramlich and Grundl, 2020).[22] Further, the evidence suggesting that institutional holdings induce anticompetitive behavior outside the financial industry is inconclusive (see Gerardi, et al., 2023).[23] Thus, much more work on the topic in the banking sector might be needed to draw public policy lessons. For example, common ownership has been shown to prompt more disclosure by non-financial firms (see Park et al., 2019).[24] But, it is unlikely to enhance more disclosure by banking firms for a number of reasons: presence of a significant amount of soft information in banks, proprietary nature of borrower information (see Bhattacharya-Chiesa, 1995),[25] risk sharing (see Dang et al., 2025),[26] and reluctance of banks to disclose any information without knowing how it would be perceived by supervisors and regulators. A potential area of financial stability concerns that has not received attention by regulators and academics is concentration of holdings of bank credit by institutional investors (see Mehran and Mollineaux, 2012).[27] How institutions would manage their bank credit holdings is an important financial stability issue, particularly in a crisis period. To our knowledge, this issue has not been studied by regulators. To underscore the benefit of effective banking activism on financial stability, we also focus on banks rather than investors. Due to weak economic conditions in New England following the S&L crisis, the Bank of Boston (established in 1784) and Baybank were forced to merge in 1996 to operate more effectively. The new entity, BankBoston, was acquired in 1999 by FleetBoston Financial. That, too, was absorbed, by Bank of America in 1999, an entity that exists today due to the financial protection of the U.S. taxpayers because of its size. Thus, when activism does not exist or has little impact in the banking industry, particularly in a crisis period, the control market could function as a substitute. However, the control market produces bigger institutions with larger supervisory challenges, a result that is also favored by regulators and supervisors as it transfers the assets of weaker institutions to stronger banks, thus lowering potential cost of the FDIC fund in the short term (see Prescott (2024) for an example).[28] However, larger institutions impose a higher cost on the economy in the event of their failure. Thus, fostering effective activism could reduce the extreme events that increasingly seem routine. Regulation and supervision have weakened the influence of activist investors and blockholders on bank governance and conduct as well as on financial stability. Further, no evidence yet exists that an increase in the permitted level of block ownership from 5 percent to 10 percent has had any measurable impact on bank conduct. While more activism has been evident in the past five years, instances were not likely to be related to changes in 2020 control ownership, as a similar trend existed outside financial firms. Moreover, increased activism in the banking sector was mostly targeted at smaller institutions and with no clear evidence of having made banks more valuable or healthier. Arguably, activism and block ownership are critical to the functioning of the U.S. capital market and businesses. But bank supervision and regulation have made these tactics ineffective. More disclosure and more timely disclosure by regulators could lift the imposed opacity and could make activism more vibrant (see Mehran and Spatt, 2024). This post comes to us from Hamid Mehran, a financial economist, and Chester Spatt, the Pamela R. and Kenneth B. Dunn Professor of Finance at Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School of Business.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Media startup Minute Media, backed by BlackRock BLK and Goldman Sachs GS is betting big on that trend with its Sept. 9 acquisition of VideoVerse, an Indian AI company valued between $200 million and $250 million. The deal gives Minute Media, owner of sports content brands The Players' Tribune, Sports Illustrated, and 90 Minutes, access to technology that automatically extracts highlights and builds content packages from live sports footage. According to TechCrunch, VideoVerse's platform already works with the Indian Premier League, Women's Premier League Cricket, FIFA+, Nippon TV, and Cubber TV. Don't Miss: Founded in Mumbai in 2016 by Vinayak Shrivastav, VideoVerse initially built AI tools for industries outside sports. One early product flagged smoking and drinking scenes for India's film certification board, while another identified objects for e-commerce platforms. Shrivastav said that the turning point came in 2016 when Hotstar, now owned by Jio, sought solutions to detect action points in cricket matches. "In 2016, Hotstar [which is now owned by Jio] was growing, and they were looking for a solution that could identify certain action points in sports and primarily in cricket," Shrivastav told TechCrunch. Over time, the company abandoned its other projects and focused entirely on AI tools for sports broadcasters. VideoVerse now operates as a software-as-a-service platform, charging clients based on the hours of footage processed. Trending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share. The company has grown to $65 million in revenue with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization margins between 35% and 40%, according to TechCrunch. VideoVerse Chief Strategy Officer Prateek Sharma told TechCrunch that the company has launched new AI tools that enable clients to define custom highlight rules. For example, a broadcaster can create automated clips of every three-pointer made by a specific player in a basketball game and instantly publish them to social media, TechCrunch reported. The platform also added AI-powered translation features to help leagues and broadcasters expand global fan engagement. While some processes incorporate third-party models, Sharma said VideoVerse relies on its proprietary model to identify the most important moments in matches. See Also: Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years — This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It Minute Media CEO Asaf Peled told TechCrunch that the acquisition is the largest in the company's history in terms of both size and value. Minute Media has raised $260 million, reaches more than 200 million monthly users, and supports nearly 500 publishers through its business-to-business content distribution platform. "With the VideoVerse acquisition, we can go to customers and pitch the AI suite, which is helpful for content creation. Then we can add our distribution and monetization capabilities on top of it to get more value out of the content," Peled said. Peled added that the company wants to target U.S.-based leagues with VideoVerse's tools to meet rising demand for highlight-driven mobile sports coverage. Reports, like an IBM study, indicate that sports fans are consuming games differently. While the company is not currently raising capital, Peled said it may look to secure additional funding in the coming quarters to pursue further acquisitions.

Title: Meta’s new Ray-Ban smart glasses have an integrated display and gesture-based controls
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/09/17/metas-new-ray-ban-smart-glasses-integrated-display-gesture-based-controls/

UPDATED 22:55 EDT / SEPTEMBER 17 2025 by Mike Wheatley Meta Platforms Inc. is racing ahead of its competitors in the virtual reality and augmented reality worlds with the launch of a new and more sophisticated pair of Ray-Ban branded smart glasses. It debuted alongside a new technology called Hyperscape, which enables Meta’s VR headset Quest to replicate real-world spaces in a virtual environment. Meta founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg took to the stage late today at the company’s annual Meta Connect event, where he showcased the company’s next-generation smart glasses. They’re called the Meta Ray-Ban Display, and unlike the original Ray-Ban Meta specs, they come with a built-in display on the right lens. It’s visible only to the wearer, and meant to show various applications, notifications and directions. The smart glasses can be controlled by a special wristband called the Meta Neural Band, which picks up on the user’s gestures. There’s an integrated AI assistant that allows for voice controls so users can navigate through social media applications and browse the internet, and the specs also feature a built-in camera, speakers and microphone. Meta Ray-Ban Display is a notable upgrade that makes it possible for smart glasses to do pretty much any task that can be done on a smartphone, and if it can popularize the concept it could be a game-changer for the company. For years, Meta has been forced to reach its users through third-party devices such as Apple Inc.’s iPhones, Google LLC’s Android phones and Microsoft Corp.’s Windows computers, but with the Ray-Ban Display, it now owns the hardware as well as the software. Onstage, Zuckerberg spoke about all of the different things users will be able to do with Meta Ray-Ban Display that couldn’t be done with the company’s original smart glasses. The most important thing is the display, which allows users to view posts in their Facebook feed and messages on apps like WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as live translations. The Neural Band that ships with the device is similar to something like a Fitbit fitness device, and its purpose is to give users a way to navigate apps in Ray-Ban Display using small hand movements. It uses a technology known as electromyography, which picks up on the signals sent between the brain and the hand when performing gestures, Zuckerberg explained. He also mentioned that it’s water-resistant, just like the smart glasses, and has 18 hours of battery life. It should be noted that Meta Ray-Ban Display lacks some of the features seen on Meta’s prototype Orion smart glasses, which were shown off by Zuckerberg at Connect 2024. The Orion came with augmented reality lenses that could overlay graphics directly on the lens, and had an eye-tracking system to understand what people are looking at. Meta Ray-Ban Display, on the other hand, only has a small display integrated with what is otherwise just a standard lens. The good news is that consumers will be able to get their hands on Meta Ray-Ban Display soon. Zuckerberg said it’s going on sale in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., France, Italy, Spain, Austria, Belgium, Australia, Ireland, UAE, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands at the end of this month, with a price tag of $799. It’s also going to launch in Brazil and India “soon.” Those who don’t find the idea of an integrated display to their liking may want to check out the improved version of Meta’s displayless Ray-Ban Meta glasses. The company’s original smart glasses are getting a better battery that lasts up to eight hours, which is almost twice as long as before. There’s also a new “conversation focus” feature that amplifies the voice of whoever the wearer is speaking to, so they can hear them more clearly in noisy environments. It utilizes the specs’ integrated microphone to pick out the speaker’s voice, while artificial intelligence algorithms filter out the background noise, Zuckerberg said. In addition, Ray-Ban Meta is adding support for German and Portuguese language translation, but it will come at a higher cost, with the new version priced at $379, up from $299 for the older model. There’s a third pair of smart specs too. Meta said it has partnered with Oakley Inc. to create the Oakley Meta Vanguard (above) which is designed for “high-intensity sports.” It was first announced earlier this year, and features Oakley’s characteristic wraparound design and integrates fitness applications like Garmin and Strava, so wearers can ask Meta AI questions about their training performance. It has an IP67 rating that certifies its dust and water resistance and comes with a 12 megapixel, 122-degree camera that’s fitted on the nose bridge, enabling it to shoot videos at 3K resolution. It also supports new capture modes including slow-motion, time-lapse and hyperlapse, which will be available on the company’s other smart glasses too. Zuckerberg said Oakley Meta Vanguard has a battery life of about nine hours, and will cost $499 when it goes on sale next month. Moving away from specs to Quest, which is Meta’s flagship VR headset, there wasn’t any new hardware on show, but the older model is getting what looks to be a fascinating new capability in the shape of Hyperscape. Zuckerberg first spoke about Hyperscape at last year’s Connect, and it’s now being made available in early access. With Hyperscape, Quest users can scan whatever physical space they happen to be in and then ask the device to recreate that environment in VR. Though the capture process only takes a few minutes, during which users just walk around the room or space and make sure everything is videoed carefully, the actual creation process will take a “few hours,” Zuckerberg said. It uses technologies including Gaussian Splatting, cloud rendering and high-bandwidth streaming to recreate an immersive, photorealistic replica of any physical space, with the new Horizon Engine enabling better graphics and faster performance to generate more realistic virtual worlds than ever seen before. On stage at Connect, Zuckerberg demonstrated a few renderings of real-world locations, including Gordon Ramsey’s kitchen (above) at his home in Los Angeles, The Octagon at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas, Chance the Rapper’s House of Kicks, and a room that’s filled with the social media influencer Happy Kelli’s extensive Crocs shoe collection. While users will only be able to enjoy the spaces they create alone for the time being, Zuckerberg said the company is working on allowing users to invite others into their digital spaces via a private link, and hopes to add this capability in future. The Hyperscape is being rolled out gradually on Meta’s Quest 3 and Quest 3S headsets, and will be available to users aged 18 and older.

Goldiam has responded swiftly with a U.S.‐origin casting model, a globally accepted and compliant approach that effectively mitigates tariff exposure:  Through its U.S. subsidiary, Goldiam now casts raw gold into unfinished jewellery pieces within the United States.  These castings are then shipped to India for finishing, polishing, and diamond setting.  The final jewellery is re‐exported to the U.S., where it qualifies for tariff exemptions under U.S. Customs rules. Because the gold is bought and casted in the U.S., the product retains U.S. origin status. As a result, no tariff applies to the gold component, and instead 5.5% duty is levied on the incremental value addition (diamonds and labour).

In 2024, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board reduced the Federal Funds Rate from 5.375% to 4.375%. Today, after an extended pause, they cut it again from 4.375% to 4.125%. More importantly, the Fed signalled two additional rate cuts in 2025, which would bring the Federal Funds Rate down to 3.625% by year-end, still slightly ahead of the neutral rate. There is more room to cut rates in 2026. Historically, when the Fed lowers rates, capital tends to shift out of safe assets such as U.S. Treasuries and bank deposits into riskier assets, including equities, private equity, venture capital, and emerging markets. The anticipated rate cuts in 2025 and in 2026 are expected to boost the valuations of risky assets. As a result, India should expect stronger capital inflows—particularly in Q4, when large global asset managers finalize allocations. This comes at a time when the Indian economy is demonstrating resilience, even in the face of headwinds such as the Trump administration’s imposition of a 50% tariff on Indian exports. Overall, India stands to benefit from a “double engine” of global liquidity easing and strong domestic fundamentals. Vikram Kasat, Head - Advisory, PL Capital. “The Fed Cuts, Wall Street Yawns Wish Granted - Like a dog chasing cars, Wall Street didn’t know what to do with itself once it finally got its rate cut. 2025 now marks the 3rd year since 1996 where rate cuts have happened with the S&P 500 at record highs The Recession That Never Was - The base case remains for a 25bp rate cut even though inflation is still running well above the 2% target based on the latest data. US headline CPI and core CPI were up 2.9% YoY and 3.1% YoY, respectively, in August. The official reason is growing evidence of labour market weakness US commercial banks’ total loan growth has risen from 1.5% YoY in mid-March 2024 to 4.6% YoY in early September 2025, while commercial and industrial (C&I) loan growth is up from a negative 2.6% YoY to 4.1% YoY over the same period - For such reasons it is entirely possible to make the argument that the US economy could be in the early days of a new cyclical rebound Nifty 25330.25 Nifty has decisively closed above the high of 25250 Support Levels 20HMA: 25209 40HEMA: 25130” EaseMyTrip partners with Hoi for India's first Smart Kiosk Rewards Program at major airports, offering travel benefits to passengers.

KPI Green Energy's green bond listing marks a milestone in sustainable finance for India's renewable sector. Renisha Chainani, Head of Research of Augmont, writes - Gold and silver prices continued to decline as a result of the dollar’s rise, after the U.S. Federal Reserve dropped interest rates by 25 bps, as anticipated, and signalled two more cuts this year as the job market deteriorated. · Chair Jerome Powell, meanwhile, expressed caution about additional easing, characterising the action as a risk-management strategy in reaction to a deteriorating labour market. The central bank will evaluate the future trajectory of interest rates “meeting-by-meeting,” he continued. · Due to persistent geopolitical concerns, Fed easing expectations, and robust central bank demand, gold has increased 40% so far this year. · The Bank of England and the Bank of Japan are anticipated to maintain policy stability this week, while the Bank of Canada also reduced its policy rate by 25 basis points. Technical Triggers · Gold Oct Futures seems to have topped out, and if it sustains below $3700 (~Rs 109,500), then we could only see further profit booking up to $3650(~Rs 108,000) and $3600 (~Rs 106,500). · Silver Nov Futures also seems to have topped out around $43, the next target is $41(~Rs 123,500). Sell on rallies The Nifty IT index surged 0.92 per cent to 36,780.85 points in morning trade, with all constituent stocks advancing as investors responded positively to the Federal Reserve’s 25 basis point interest rate cut announced overnight. Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group. The U.S. Fed’s 25 basis points rate cut is expected to have a measured impact on Indian markets. Softer U.S. yields enhance the relative appeal of Indian assets, which could draw interest from global investors into emerging markets. But the wide anticipation of at least a 25 bps cut was already factored in by the market to a great extent. That said, a more decisive driver for market sentiment would be the progress on the U.S.–India trade deal, which would ease some pressures by lowering tariff barriers. Domestically the ongoing momentum is being supported by GST reforms, while the prospect of an agreement with the US. Further, the Fed projections of an additional 50 basis points cut in 2025 ahead, coupled with the previous stated factors would greatly ease the situation and FII positioning for Indian markets. Still, in the near term, sectors with exposure to international borrowings and export-oriented industries could benefit, providing selective opportunities.

With US being a large market for exports, the fed cut post the implementation of tariffs will drive momentum in exports by bringing in some relief to the business. In terms of gold, the prices declined in the domestic as well as international markets after setting a new high in India before the Fed rate cut. It is expected that the gold prices in India will further rise though but this can be cushioned if the rupee gains strength against the dollar. Going ahead, we expect gold prices to be elevated with lower U.S yields making the metal more attractive to investors. In the domestic market, the demand is likely to remain steady even with mild price fluctuation, given the festive and wedding season. Prices could hover in the range of INR 1,10,000 to 1,12,000/10 gms in the domestic market and USD 3600 to 3700/Oz in the international markets in the near term.” China’s exports of refined oil products in August rose 8.5% year-on-year, according to customs data, but slowed from July when it recorded the highest monthly total since June 2024. - Reuters The rupee depreciated 16 paise to 88.01 against the US dollar in early trade on Thursday, as traders assessed the US FED outlook following a rate cut. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points, marking its first reduction of the year. This decision reflects a cautious approach to supporting the labour market amid increasing employment risks. The dovish stance is expected to lower borrowing costs and encourage consumer spending in the U.S. markets, which could lead to gains in equities, bonds, and real estate. However, some volatility may persist due to internal divisions. In India, the Fed’s actions could attract foreign capital, strengthening the rupee and benefiting stock indices like the BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty. This favourable environment may help ease inflationary pressures and provide the RBI room for adjustments, although exporters might face challenges from currency strength. When combined with domestic factors, including the RBI’s earlier interest rate reductions, specifically a 50 basis point cut in June 2025 and another cut in April, as well as GST rate rationalization and various measures to boost consumption, the outlook for India’s economy appears strong. Potential GDP growth is projected to remain steady at around 6.5% to 6.7% for FY2025/26. Given these favourable conditions, several sectors, including Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI), Information Technology (IT), Metals, and Domestic Consumption (FMCG, Retail, Durables), are positioned for potential gains.

Retail Participation in Cash Segment – A Sharp Decline Retail investors once dominated direct equity trading, but their share in NSE’s cash market has dropped to 34.2% in FY25-26 (till August). This is a sharp fall from the pandemic peak of 45% in FY20-21, when retail enthusiasm was at its highest. Current levels are comparable to 2015-16, highlighting a gradual retreat from direct market dominance. 2. Why Retail Investors are Withdrawing Pandemic Euphoria Faded: During COVID, easy apps and abundant liquidity brought millions of new investors. But many came for quick gains and exited after facing cycles of poor returns. Shift Towards Indirect Routes: Instead of trading themselves, many retail investors now prefer mutual funds, insurance-linked products, and PMS where professionals manage money. Regulatory Tightening: SEBI has raised margin rules, introduced stricter norms, and curbed speculative trading in F&O. Losses in F&O: Data shows most new entrants lost money in F&O, and sharp corrections in many mid- and small-cap stocks further discouraged direct participation. 3. Where Retail Money is Moving Mutual Funds & Systematic Plans (SIPs): Steady inflows suggest retailers are now choosing professional fund managers over self-trading. Insurance & PMS: Increasing reliance on structured, long-term wealth management solutions. Indirect Exposure to F&O: Retailers’ footprint in futures & options rose from 23% in FY15-16 to 27.7% in FY25-26 (till August). 4. Key Risks and Lessons for Retailers Chasing Quick Profits Backfires: Many investors entered for short-term gains but faced losses. The lesson: discipline matters more than thrill. High-Risk Speculation Curbed: Stricter rules may reduce short-term excitement, but they are designed to protect investors from reckless losses. Market Reality Check: Small and mid-cap stocks have fallen 30-40% from peaks, versus only 4-5% in the broader index. This proves that investing without understanding fundamentals can be dangerous. 5. Outlook – A More Mature Market Ahead Experts believe that although curbs may dampen high-risk speculation, they will foster a healthier, long-term investing environment. With retail investors moving towards mutual funds and institutions playing a stronger role, India’s market is slowly shifting to a sustainable growth path. Future success for retailers lies in: Understanding fundamentals rather than speculation. Diversifying via funds instead of only direct stocks. Adopting discipline and patience rather than chasing momentum. Aluminium prices expected to stay high in 2025 due to a weaker dollar and stable Chinese demand.

Bulls Stay in Control, Key Levels to Watch Post Fed Rate Cut The US Federal Reserve delivered a widely anticipated 25-basis-point rate cut on Wednesday. With the US being the world’s largest economy, this decision has global market implications and early cues are already reflecting in positive US indices and Gift Nifty, hinting at a positive opening for Nifty today. Nifty 50 extended its winning streak on Wednesday, gaining 91.15 points (+0.36%) to close at 25,330.25. The index continues to exhibit strong bullish momentum, backed by robust volumes. Technically, the spot remains well above its 9-, 20-, and 50-day EMAs, with the RSI (14) reading at 67 — inching toward the overbought zone. While this does not guarantee a reversal, traders should watch for potential consolidation or a healthy pullback towards the psychological 25,000 level. Such dips could present attractive buy-on-dip opportunities if the bullish bias sustains. On the upside, immediate resistance lies at 25,400 — a breakout above this zone could open doors for 25,500–25,600 levels. On the downside, 25,250 acts as the first line of support, followed by 25,100. For Thursday’s session, the expected range is between 25,470 on the higher side and 25,160 on the lower side if 25,250 fails to hold. In the institutional flow space, FIIs continued their selling streak with net outflows of ₹989.81 crore, while DIIs stepped in aggressively by pumping in ₹2,205.12 crore which provided strong support to the market’s bullish undertone. The U.S. Fed’s 25-bps rate cut marks a pivotal policy shift, lowering borrowing costs and reviving global risk appetite. Growth-sensitive sectors such as housing, tech, and small caps stand to benefit, though banks may face margin compression. A softer dollar also improves the prospects of stronger FII inflows into India. Coupled with consistent DII support and stable technical underpinnings, this development strengthens the case for continued market upside—so long as global cues remain favorable. FII Caution vs DII Confidence FIIs remain cautious, having offloaded ₹11,330.08 crores in the cash market month-to-date. However, their strategic additions in index futures (₹4,727.78 crores) and options (₹6,739.97 crores) reflect hedging activity rather than outright bearishness. Counterbalancing this, DIIs have infused ₹32,892.91 crores, supported by resilient retail SIP flows and confidence in India’s long-term growth story. This steady domestic support has anchored sentiment and offset external nervousness. Open Interest Signals Open Interest data indicates firm resistance around the 25,500–26,000 strike, where rising call OI suggests sellers may assert pressure. At the same time, concentrated put OI at 25,150–25,000 highlights strong defensive positioning, reinforcing the support base. The balance of OI shifts suggests cautious optimism, with market participants hedging while staying positioned for an eventual breakout. Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty 50 are likely to open gap up, as trend in GIFT Nifty suggests a positive start for the broader index. Asian markets were trading mixed in early trade.

Title: NVIDIA Invests $5B in Intel to Co-Develop AI and PC Chips
URL: https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/news/nvidia-invests-5b-in-intel-to-codevelop-ai-and-pc-chips
Time Published: 2025-09-18T00:00:00Z

September 18, 2025 — In a landmark move for the tech industry, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) announced a multi-year collaboration to co-develop AI infrastructure and personal computing products that blend their respective strengths in GPUs and CPUs. At the heart of this collaboration is NVIDIA NVLink, which will tightly connect NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing platforms with Intel’s x86 CPU ecosystem. The goal: to deliver cutting-edge solutions for data centers, enterprises, and consumers. Intel will design and manufacture NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs, which NVIDIA will integrate into its AI infrastructure platforms. These processors will be optimized for hyperscale data centers and enterprise-grade AI workloads. On the consumer side, Intel plans to launch x86 system-on-chips (SoCs) that integrate NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets. These RTX SoCs are designed to power a wide range of PCs, offering world-class CPU-GPU integration to handle modern workloads from gaming to AI-powered productivity. As part of the collaboration, NVIDIA will invest $5 billion in Intel’s common stock at a purchase price of $23.28 per share. This deal remains subject to standard regulatory approvals. Jensen Huang, NVIDIA’s founder and CEO, highlighted the significance: AI is powering a new industrial revolution and reinventing every layer of the computing stack — from silicon to systems to software. At the heart of this reinvention is NVIDIA’s CUDA architecture. This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel’s CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem — a fusion of two world-class platforms. Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing. Lip-Bu Tan, Intel’s CEO, emphasized the shared vision: Intel’s x86 architecture has been foundational to modern computing for decades — and we are innovating across our portfolio to enable the workloads of the future. Intel’s leading data center and client computing platforms, combined with our process technology, manufacturing and advanced packaging capabilities, will complement NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing leadership to enable new breakthroughs for the industry. We appreciate the confidence Jensen and the NVIDIA team have placed in us with their investment and look forward to the work ahead as we innovate for customers and grow our business. This partnership signals a reshaping of the semiconductor industry landscape, as rivals-turned-partners align to meet surging AI demand. For developers, enterprises, and end-users, it promises more tightly integrated hardware that can handle the growing complexity of AI-driven applications. ©2025 C# Corner.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us AI chip startup Groq confirmed Wednesday that it raised a fresh $750 million in funding at a post-money valuation of $6.9 billion. This topped the rumored numbers when word leaked in July that Groq was raising. At that time, reports suggested that the raise would be about $600 million, at near a $6 billion valuation. Groq, which also sells data center computing power, previously raised $640 million at a $2.8 billion valuation in August 2024, making this more than double the valuation in about a year. Groq has now raised over $3 billion to date, PitchBook estimates. Groq has been a hot commodity because it is working on breaking the chokehold that AI chip maker Nvidia has over the tech industry. Groq’s chips are not GPUs, the graphics processing units that typically power AI systems. Instead, Groq calls them LPUs, (language processing units) and calls its hardware an inference engine — specialized computers optimized for running AI models quickly and efficiently. Its products are geared toward developers and enterprises, available as either a cloud service or an on-premises hardware cluster. The on-prem hardware is a server rack outfitted with a stack of its integrated hardware/software nodes. Both the cloud and on-prem hardware run open versions of popular models, like those from Meta, DeepSeek, Qwen, Mistral, Google and OpenAI. Groq says its offerings maintain, or in some cases improve, AI performance at significantly less cost than alternatives. Groq’s founder, Jonathan Ross, has a particularly relevant pedigree for this work. Ross previously worked at Google developing its Tensor Processing Unit chip, which are specialized processors designed for machine learning tasks. The TPU was announced in 2016, the same year Groq emerged from stealth. TPUs still power Google Cloud’s AI services. Groq says it now powers the AI apps of more than 2 million developers, up from 356,000 developers when the company talked to TechCrunch a year ago. The new round was led by investment firm Disruptive, with additional funding from BlackRock, Neuberger Berman, Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners, and others. Existing investors, including Samsung, Cisco, D1, and Altimeter, also joined the round. Topics Venture Editor Founders: land your investor and sharpen your pitch.

Title: UK shows Trump how much they need ‘special relationship’ with US

The British monarchy cranked up the pageantry for President Trump Wednesday, paying tribute to the “Special Relationship” between the US and UK at its most fraught point in more than half a century. On the first full day of Trump’s unprecedented second state visit across the pond, he and first lady Melania Trump got the royal treatment in the form of a personal greeting from King Charles III; Queen Camilla; Prince William, the heir to the throne; and Catherine, Princess of Wales — followed by the largest military ceremonial welcome ever. From a carriage procession to a 200-piece military band and an extravagant banquet in 11th century Windsor Castle, Wednesday’s agenda seemed tailor-made to please Trump, a well-known admirer of both the British royals and pomp and circumstance. “A lot of things here warm my heart,” President Trump told reporters after landing in London on Tuesday, describing King Charles, who is undergoing cancer treatment, as “my friend.” Forgotten, at least for one day, was recent sparring between Washington and London over trade relations, free speech, Big Tech, how to deal with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the response to Israel’s invasion of Gaza to destroy Hamas. Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more. Please provide a valid email. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. But reality will be waiting when Trump holds a closely watched bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the latter’s country residence, Chequers, on Thursday. The presidential visit is the climax of a charm offensive begun seven months ago, when Starmer presented Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting him to the UK at a time when the alliance seemed strained over the war in Ukraine. Since then, Starmer has been further damaged by controversy over immigration and political scandal, having fired Ambassador to the US Peter Mandelson just last week following the emergence of embassaing emails between the envoy and late convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Top of the agenda will be economic relations, after a proposed agreement to eliminate tariffs on British steel exports to the US was put on hold hours before Air Force One touched down at Stansted Airport. Wednesday’s state banquet invitees included the CEOs of British economic mainstays Rolls-Royce, BAE and GSK, along with American executives Tim Cook of Apple and Larry Fink of BlackRock, highlighting again the important business ties between the two countries ahead of the crunch talks. The UK hopes to secure deals worth more than $10 billion during Trump’s two-day visit, but may have to swallow some scoldings in exchange. Both Trump and Vice President JD Vance have attacked British laws on free speech grounds, slamming the UK’s Online Safety Act and warning publicly that freedom in Europe is “in retreat.” “If you are running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you,” Vance told a room of stunned diplomats at the Munich Security Conference in February. In recent weeks, the UK has seen fresh protests, with more than 100,000 joining a weekend anti-immigrant “Unite the Kingdom” rally in London, at which Tesla and X CEO Elon Musk appeared via video link to call for Starmer’s ouster. “You can’t – we don’t have another four years, or whenever the next election is, it’s too long. Something’s got to be done. There’s got to be a dissolution of Parliament and a new vote held,” Musk said, warning that the British public are “scared to exercise their free speech” today. “You’re in a fundamental situation here. Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die, that’s the truth I think.” Advertisement

Title: Jerome Powell on signs of an AI bubble and an economy leaning too hard on the rich: ‘Unusually large amounts of economic activity’

Time Published: 2025-09-17T22:29:07Z

Eva is a fellow on Fortune's news desk. For months, Wall Street commentators have fretted that the artificial intelligence boom looks like a bubble, with capital spending – which some analysts estimate could reach $3 trillion by 2028 – fattening a few mega-cap firms, while lower-income workers suffer from a slack labor market. On Wednesday, they got validation from an unlikely source: the chair of the Federal Reserve. Jerome Powell said the U.S. is seeing “unusually large amounts of economic activity through the AI buildout,” a rare acknowledgement from the central bank that the surge is not only outsized, but also skewed toward the wealthy. That imbalance extends beyond markets. Roughly 70% of U.S. economic growth comes from consumer spending, yet most households live paycheck to paycheck. That demand picture has taken on a shape that analysts call K-shaped: while many families cut back on essentials, wealthier households continue to spend on travel, tech, and luxury goods—and they continued to do so in August. For now, the inflation recovery depends heavily on this dynamic remaining in fragile stasis. It’s a fix that works well until it doesn’t, if it could be described as working at all.“[Spending] may well be skewed toward higher-earning consumers,” Powell told reporters after the Fed’s latest policy meeting. “There’s a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest that.” That skew has become increasingly obvious in markets. Just seven firms — Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla — now make up more than 30% of the S&P 500’s value. Their relentless AI capex is keeping business investment positive, even as overall job growth has slowed to a crawl. Goldman Sachs estimates AI spending accounted for nearly all of the 7% year-over-year gain in corporate capex this spring. The comments underscore a widening concern at the Fed: that while headline GDP growth is holding above 1.5%, the composition of that growth is uneven, unlike previous booms in housing or manufacturing. Powell pointed to “kids coming out of college and younger people, minorities” as struggling to find jobs in today’s cooling labor market, even as affluent households continue to spend freely and companies funnel cash into cutting-edge technologies. The imbalance reflects what Powell described as “a low firing, low hiring environment,” where layoffs remain rare but job creation has slowed to a crawl. That dynamic, combined with the concentration of economic gains in AI and among the wealthy, risks deepening inequality, and complicates the Fed’s attempt to balance its inflation and employment mandates. That disconnect risks widening the gap between Wall Street and Main Street. While affluent households continue to spend freely and tech titans pour billions into data centers and chips, revised jobs data show the economy added just 22,000 positions in August, with unemployment edging up to 4.3%. “Unusually large” AI investment may sustain top-line growth, Powell suggested, but it’s doing little to lift the broad labor market.“The overall job finding rate is very, very low,” he said. “If layoffs begin to rise, there won’t be a lot of hiring going on.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Democrats are still figuring out how to handle Zohran Mamdani: From the Politics Desk

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, a newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. In today’s edition, Ben Kamisar breaks down the split among prominent New York Democrats on Zohran Mamdani, seven weeks out from the mayoral election. Plus, Andrea Mitchell examines how Britain laid out the red carpet (and more) for President Donald Trump. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner Zohran Mamdani scored endorsements this week from key members of the New York Democratic establishment in his bid for mayor, but he’s still waiting on two of the biggest names from his city. Gov. Kathy Hochul and state Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie announced their support for Mamdani in recent days, while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries — both New York Democrats — are continuing to keep some distance from the democratic socialist. The split shows how the Democratic Party’s leaders haven’t fully settled on how much to embrace the energy bubbling up among progressives in New York City and elsewhere, after Mamdani scored an upset victory in the June primary. Mamdani’s newfound backers have in part framed their support as a sign of the party coming together. In a New York Times op-ed, Hochul wrote that while she’s had “frank conversations” and “disagreements” with Mamdani, she believes he is focused on the key issues that matter to New York City residents. As he endorsed Mamdani today, Heastie cast him as an optimist promising a better direction for New York City. “I do think this city is clamoring for something new and different,” Heastie said. “He has a romantic view of what this city can be and should be. And sometimes people want to be romanced.” Meanwhile, the lack of support from Schumer and Jeffries for Mamdani has rankled some progressives. Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland blasted the non-endorsements during a recent address to Iowa Democrats, leading Jeffries’ spokesperson Justin Chermol to tell The New York Times that “confused New Yorkers are asking themselves the question: Chris Van Who?” Schumer told reporters yesterday that he met with Mamdani last week for a “good conversation.” And Jeffries downplayed any potential concerns from the left. “I haven’t had a conversation with any member of Congress who’s expressed frustration to me as it relates to the New York City mayoral race,” he told reporters. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., told NBC News in an interview that the lack of an endorsement from Democratic leadership is “a little perplexing.” “Look, it is hard for me to understand how the Democratic leadership is not supporting the candidate who won the Democratic primary, or the candidate who has gotten 50, 60,000 people volunteering for his campaign, has created enormous excitement, gotten new people to register to vote. How do you not support that candidate?” Sanders said. Read more from Ben → In the aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s assassination, President Donald Trump and his allies have threatened to bring the weight of the federal government against what they refer to as the “radical left.” But the suggestion that a secret network of violent left-wing extremists was behind the killing stands in contrast to the evidence that law enforcement officials presented on Tuesday in Utah, where Kirk was fatally shot. There was no indication presented that the suspect, Tyler Robinson, was a member of a group or that he fell under the sway of a particular leader. The investigation is ongoing. Experts told NBC News that the Trump administration appears to be using Kirk’s assassination as an excuse to crack down on left-wing individuals and groups. While administration officials have yet to detail their plans, statements by Miller and others raise questions of who exactly would be targeted, how, and what effect this might have in stifling political dissent. Read more → In a relationship strained by tariffs, the war in Ukraine and starvation in Gaza, America’s British cousins rolled out more than just a red carpet. President Donald Trump’s second state visit, a special honor rarely, if ever, accorded a foreign leader, began with a ride in a horse-drawn carriage, a military parade and a “flypast,” as the Brits call an Air Force “flyover.” During a tour of Windsor’s historic artifacts, a clearly awestruck president declared, “That’s the real deal.” The palace laid out a white-tie state dinner on a table more than 51 yards long decorated with 139 candles, 1,452 pieces of cutlery and five crystal glasses at each setting. The president could be forgiven for occasionally breaking protocol by patting King Charles on his back and walking in front of the monarch while reviewing the troops, as he did with Queen Elizabeth in 2019. He also told Princess Kate on their first greeting, “You’re beautiful, so beautiful.” The serious business of the visit is business. The pomp and circumstance was aimed at softening up Trump to improve the U.K.’s tariff deal with the U.S. Invitees to the lavish dinner included the CEOs of BlackRock, Apple, Nvidia, the Blackstone Group, Bank of America and OpenAI. What Great Britain can offer that few other countries can is the royal touch. That’s especially important with a prime minister, Keir Starmer, who is adept at flattery but less in line with Trump’s politics than Nigel Farage, leader of the rival Reform UK party. The Windsor grounds were also a relatively safe space for a visit uninterrupted by thousands of anti-Trump demonstrators in London, except for the projection of Trump-Epstein images on the castle walls on the eve of the president’s arrival. It’s a high bar for other trading partners planning their own state visits for Trump. One such competitor is China’s Xi Jinping, next in line for a possible Trump visit. The two are planning a call on Friday when an invitation to Beijing is expected to be proffered and quickly accepted. That worries some foreign policy experts, including a former U.S. national security adviser and prominent foreign diplomat. They note that Xi can parade even more military might than Great Britain. Who knows what economic benefits could result. That’s all From the Politics Desk for now. Today’s newsletter was compiled by Adam Wollner and Bridget Bowman.

Title: Bitcoin Has Taken Gold’s Role In Today’s World, Eric Trump Says

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Eric Trump on Tuesday described Bitcoin as a “modern-day gold,” calling it a liquid store of value that can act as a hedge to real estate and other assets. According to reports, the remark came during a TV appearance on CNBC’s Squawk Box, tied to the launch of American Bitcoin, the mining and treasury firm he helped start. Based on public filings and company summaries, American Bitcoin has accumulated 2,443 BTC on its balance sheet. That stash has been valued in the low hundreds of millions of dollars at recent spot prices. The firm mixes large-scale mining with the goal of holding Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, which it says will help it grow both production and asset holdings over time. Eric Trump’s comments were direct. He told viewers that institutions are treating Bitcoin more like a store of value than a fringe idea, and he warned firms that resist blockchain adoption. The tone was strong at times, and the line about Bitcoin being a modern equivalent of gold was used to frame American Bitcoin’s role as both miner and holder. Eric Trump has said: bitcoin is modern-day gold — unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) September 16, 2025 American Bitcoin moved toward a public listing via an all-stock merger with Gryphon Digital Mining earlier this year, a deal that kept most of the original shareholders in control and positioned the new entity for a Nasdaq debut. Reports show that mining partner Hut 8 holds a large ownership stake, leaving the Trump family and other backers with a minority share. The listing brought fresh attention and capital to the firm as it began trading under the ticker ABTC. Market watchers say the firm’s public debut highlights two trends: mining companies are trying to grow by both producing and holding Bitcoin, and political ties are bringing more headlines to crypto firms. Some analysts point out that holding large amounts of Bitcoin on the balance sheet exposes a company to price swings, while supporters argue it aligns incentives between miners and investors. Based on coverage of the launch, investors have reacted with both enthusiasm and caution. Supporters praise the prospect of a US-based miner that aims to be transparent and aggressive about building a reserve. Critics point to governance questions, possible conflicts tied to high-profile backers, and the usual risks of a volatile asset being held on corporate balance sheets. Eric Trump’s remark that Bitcoin has taken gold’s role in today’s world reflects both his belief in its value and American Bitcoin’s strategy of mining and holding. Whether that view sticks will depend on how investors and institutions respond in the months ahead. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

These deals will create more than 7,600 high-quality jobs, revitalise communities, and accelerate growth in sectors of the future. These 7,600 jobs will be in all areas of the United Kingdom: 1,000 new jobs in Belfast and 6,000 more roles from Glasgow to Warrington, the Midlands and the North-East. This investment surge will deliver real opportunities for working people — from apprenticeships in clean energy to careers in biotech and AI. This unprecedented package reflects the scale of ambition shared by both nations and the UK’s position as a global leader in the future-facing industries prioritised under the UK’s Modern Industrial Strategy. It comes alongside the world leading Tech Prosperity Deal, which will be signed tomorrow [Thursday] and a new major deal to turbocharge the build-out of new nuclear power in both countries. A £100 billion investment pledge from Blackstone over the next decade into the UK £3.9 billion investment from world leading investment firm, Prologis, to strengthen its current investment at Cambridge Biomedical Campus and including a major upgrade to Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal, supporting growth in life sciences and advanced manufacturing and creating local jobs in surrounding areas including Northamptonshire and Cambridgeshire. Palantir to invest up to £1.5 billion to help make the UK a defence innovation leader and create up to 350 new jobs. £150 million investment from American company, Amentum, creating more than 3,000 jobs across Glasgow to Warrington and the Midlands, expanding its UK workforce by over 50%. US Engineering firm, STAX, has committed £37 million to expand their UK operations and pioneer emission reducing technology at ports around the country. When we back British brilliance, champion our world-class industries, and forge deeper global alliances — especially with friends like the US — we help shape the future for generations to come and make people across the country better off. These investments are a testament to Britain’s economic strength and a bold signal that our country is open, ambitious, and ready to lead. Jobs, growth and opportunity is what I promised for working people, and it’s exactly what this State Visit is delivering. These record-breaking investments will create thousands of high-quality jobs across the UK — from clean energy to advanced manufacturing. It’s a huge vote of confidence in our economy and a clear sign that our Plan for Growth is delivering for working people. Working closely with the US strengthens our global position and delivers real results for British businesses. Tomorrow [Thursday], at Chequers, major UK and US investors will meet the Prime Minister and President Trump to discuss how both countries can go further to deepen economic ties and unlock new opportunities for collaboration. This State Visit marks the largest investment package ever associated with a visit of its kind, surpassing previous records set by the Chinese and Korean State Visit in 2015 and 2023 respectively. The UK-US relationship is economically balanced and mutually beneficial. Alongside the record-breaking inward investment package, today UK companies are also making significant commitments to invest the US market. Leading British pharmaceutical company, GSK, are investing nearly £22 billion ($30 billion) into US R&D and manufacturing over five years, including $1.2 billion in new facilities and AI, creating hundreds of skilled jobs and strengthening UK-US life sciences ties. UK tech company, Urenco and US nuclear company, Radiant, signed a £4 million deal to supply advanced HALEU fuel to the US market. BP plans to invest over £3.6 billion ($5 billion) annually in the US for the next five years, building on $160 billion already invested and supporting 30,000 jobs nationwide. UK tech giant, Sage, committing £1.6 billion ($2.3 billion) in operational spending in the US over three years, reflecting strong market growth and 40% US investor ownership. OakNorth are investing over $5 billion into the US market over the next three years, helping create thousands of new jobs across the country. Rothesay, the UK’s largest specialist pensions insurer, has invested over $10 billion in the US across sectors including US Public Finance (including healthcare and higher education), Residential and Commercial Real Estate and Infrastructure Revolut is set to invest over $500 million in the United States over the next 3-5 years to accelerate its expansion and support its ambition to scale as a bank for American consumers. Our investment ambitions for the expansion of Cambridge Biomedical Campus and Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal are backing two of the UK’s most critical sectors: life sciences and logistics. This demonstrates our commitment to fostering innovation and delivering the sustainable infrastructure that underpins the UK’s long-term economic growth. The US State visit reflects the unique strength of the UK-US partnership and our shared determination to drive economic growth and prosperity. The energy resilience and national security of both nations depend on continued leadership and advances in energy and technology – the focus of this visit. Commitments by both governments to back and invest in these industries help drive Amentum’s continued growth and investment in innovation, jobs and skills on both sides of the Atlantic. These investments will not only create jobs but also boost productivity, drive regional development, and equip people with the skills needed for the industries of the future. The “record-breaking” investment pledge of £150 billion refers to the largest total value of new confirmed inward investment commitments ever announced in connection with a UK state visit. It includes forward capital commitments by US firms including £90bn from Blackstone which is in addition to the £10bn that they have previously announced that they will deploy in the UK to support datacentres but which they have reaffirmed as part of a total investment pledge of £100bn over the next decade. However, if we take into consideration commitments from UK firms, banks and financial institutions to invest into the US, alongside UK Central Government commitments to buy around £60 billion ($82 billion) from US companies over the next five years then the overall total commercial package amounts to around £280 billion. Please see below for a list of all the investments announced as part of the State Visit: US to UK commitments X-Energy and Centrica plan to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors with a follow-on UK-wide programme targeting a fleet of 6GW of nuclear power. According to the companies, the Hartlepool project would generate enough power for up to 1.5 million homes and create up to 2,500 good jobs. They estimate the overall programme could deliver at least £40 billion of economic value for the UK and US, with £12 billion specifically for the North East. Last Energy and DP World plan to establish one of the world’s first micro modular nuclear power plants, backed by £80 million in private investment, to unlock a clean power supply for the expansion of DP World’s London Gateway port and business park. Amentum confirmed a £150 million investment in the UK and the creation of over 3,000 new jobs – increasing its UK workforce by over 50% over the next four years. These will be created in regions across the nation, helping create prosperity and a skilled workforce in places such as West Cumbria, the North West, the North East, the Humber, Glasgow, Suffolk and Bristol. Phillips 66 is currently investing more than £110 million per year to maintain and enhance the Humber Refinery. The company plans to keep investing in this important facility to boost fuel production, help secure the UK’s energy supply, and create hundreds of construction jobs. Prologis has announced UK investment intentions to create valuations totalling $5.2 billion (£3.9 billion), supporting the expansion of Cambridge Biomedical Campus in the South East and Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal in the Midlands. These projects focus on life sciences and logistics — two critical drivers of national growth — and will support thousands of jobs across the UK. Google has announced the opening of its data centre in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, as part of a new £5 billion investment in the UK. AI cloud computing company CoreWeave will be investing £1.5 billion in AI data centre capacity and operations in the UK – bringing total investment in the UK to £2.5 billion over the past year. As part of this investment, CoreWeave is partnering with British firm DataVita in Scotland to build one of Europe’s largest, most efficient AI data centres. It will deliver advanced compute powered by renewable energy, whilst creating local jobs and contributing to the local economy.

September 17, 2025 17:00 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: U.S. Healthcare System Seriously Threatened by Private Equity Takeover
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/u-s-healthcare-system-seriously-threatened-by-private-equity-takeover/
Time Published: 2025-09-17T20:00:00Z
Full Content:
Editor Health Paul A. Philips The health of many Americans is seriously under threat because private equity firms are taking over hospitals. These private equity firms have taken over some 450 hospitals across the United States. Private equity firm Steward had acquired over 37 hospitals in the United States alone. Besides hospitals, reports state that the takeover has extended into the acquisitions of 750 nursing homes, 200 emergency set-ups, 5,779 doctor’s practices and two-thirds of the country’s air ambulances. In this growing takeover trend, over the last 10 years, these private equity investors have paid out around $1 trillion in the last 10 years. Succinctly put by Massachusetts State Senator Cindy Friedman: “Private equity is the complete opposite of the delivery of healthcare…” She goes on to say “… make money, leave, make it however you want, make it for people who are interested in making money, and then you have got healthcare, which is all about delivering care to people. The cost is not the first thing. The delivery care is the first thing. And those two things do not mesh.” In other words, because of an increase in financialization, the effectiveness of healthcare has been significantly compromised due to private equity involvement, making a number of cost-cuts in healthcare services that, in effect, put profits over the genuine welfare concern of patients. The increase in financialization overseen by its financial actors with main street corporations has been allowed to happen due to deregulation that had taken place decades ago. -This is one of a number of examples whereby corporations ‘eat each other up’ through takeovers and buyouts. Eventually there’s only a tiny handful of giant corporations left who practically own everything through monopolization. Consider the likes of behemoth corporations like BlackRock, Blackstone and Vanguard… -As a result, the services, as in healthcare, are not as good due to cost-cutting and there’s little in the way of competition to choose from as an alternative provider. For instance, some financial overseers might work out that in a ward the number of nurses could be cut from 9 to 6 to save money or make more profits… and that’s not the only thing they would be looking at to cut back… The reports on specific incidents in relation to this are astounding: Taking the cases of three Connecticut hospitals, Manchester Memorial, Rockville General and Waterbury Hospital. Each hospital had been bought up by private equity backed Prospect Medical Holdings. Staff members of these hospitals had come forward and were interviewed. From interviewee responses a pattern unfolded. All staff repeatedly said that Prospect Medical Holdings did everything they could to save money, to the point of extremity and in every aspect. Patient care deteriorated as a result of a lack of spending on essential resources. For example, Romana, a staff member working in an operating room commented on how medical supplies had been halted. The supplies grew scarce, to the extent that the staff were left scrambling to find essential equipment at the operating theatre. There were incidents where some staff ended up purchasing equipment. Staff had also bought food for their patients or otherwise that would have gone hungry… Anne-Marie has worked as a nurse at Manchester Memorial for more than 3 decades. She told her interviewers that it was the total dedication of her colleagues that kept the hospital from falling apart. Carmen, working as a secretary at Waterbury Hospital, said that Prospect Medical Holdings ignored advice on maintaining buildings. -Because of the years of neglect, there were incidences where ceilings had literally come apart, resulting in buildings coming down. Fortunately, no one was harmed. Other appalling conditions had been reported. For instance, in a trauma room, because of structural neglect, buckets had been placed to catch water drips from ceilings at offices where computers were just missing the falling drips… Patient care deterioration at Waterbury was evidenced by having recorded the highest rates of patient readmissions in Connecticut state 2019. These three hospitals have now been stripped. They have come to their death and demise: Leonard Green & Partners (who had owned Prospect at the time) had sold off the land where the three hospitals resided as a real estate investment. The leasing company who then took over leased the land at a much higher rate, resulting in “debt and destruction” in the wake of this. For example, Rockville Hospital started losing so much money that they couldn’t afford to fully take care of their outpatients. As a consequence, Prospect, still holding on to these hospitals, has filed for bankruptcy. The future of these three hospitals will now be decided by a Texan bankruptcy judge. -This scenario is not atypical as it is happening to a number of hospitals all over the United States, as reported by Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy. In other words, these private equity firms are sucking the life out of hospitals and resources to financially take care of their investors, while patients and affected communities are left stranded. They then go on to destroy the hospitals. Wall Street Apes @WallStreetApes made a recent post claiming that in recent times around 50 hospitals nationwide have fallen victims in the above way. No doubt there will be the demise of more hospitals to come. Finally When this is allowed to happen, you can be pretty sure that it’s because of a corrupt system. -A case where moral bankruptcy precedes financial bankruptcy. Nothing is more important than your health. It’s the greatest investment you could ever make, but private equity sees things differently. The politicians allow it to happen because they have an involvement. Welcome to the ‘donor class!’ They bankrupt hospitals and line their pockets with millions of dollars as a result. Not just with hospitals and healthcare, there are other cases where Private Equity is not your friend. Take the case of Private Equity’s involvement with the buyout of utilities. The result for the people of America is that their utility bills go up by hundreds of percent, as it has, for example, in California. Then there’s a decrease in energy efficiency, while more blackouts occur, public buildings such as schools have been known to suffer more power cuts… Private Equity continues gutting the country, while lining the pockets of the select few investors.

ByAntonio Pequeño IV, Forbes Staff. Lyft shares rose as high as 14% Wednesday to a three-year high after the rideshare company announced a partnership with autonomous ride-hailing service Waymo. Lyft shares traded up 12.8% to $22.60 about 20 minutes before market close Wednesday. The surge in share price brings Lyft’s stock to its highest point since May 2022, when it dramatically fell from a post-COVID lockdown boom the year prior. The Lyft and Waymo partnership brings Waymo’s robotaxi service to Nashville, adding on to the company’s service in the cities of Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Francisco, Atlanta and Austin. Lyft will provide vehicle maintenance, infrastructure and depot operations under the agreement. Riders will be able to use Waymo’s robotaxi service first through the company’s app and later through Lyft’s app as the Nashville service grows.

Shares of Uber, Lyft’s ridesharing competitor, fell 4.2% at 2:30 p.m. EDT, erasing gains made in the last week of trading. Uber’s stock is up more than 53% this year. Lyft’s stock has been on a tear since the company announced its second quarter earnings in August, when it missed analyst expectations on revenue ($1.6 billion) and earnings per share ($0.10), but posted $4.5 billion in gross bookings—an all-time high that represented a 12% increase year-over-year. Waymo is looking to expand the market for its autonomous rides next year, with plans to bring its service to Washington, D.C., Miami and New York City. It has also been testing in cities like San Diego, Las Vegas and Houston. Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana told The New York Times podcast “Hard Fork” in August “we’re currently giving hundreds of thousands of rides every week and, in all likelihood, by the end of next year, we will be offering around one million rides per week.” Waymo has received $12 billion in investments from parent company Alphabet and other investors, and could see $300 million in ride revenue this year, according to a Forbes estimate. Waymo Is A Trillion-Dollar Opportunity. Google Just Needs To Seize It. (Forbes)

Title: Build Agentic Workflows with OpenAI GPT OSS on Amazon SageMaker AI and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore
URL: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-agentic-workflows-with-openai-gpt-oss-on-amazon-sagemaker-ai-and-amazon-bedrock-agentcore/

AWS Blogs OpenAI has released two open-weight models, gpt-oss-120b (117 billion parameters) and gpt-oss-20b (21 billion parameters), both built with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) design and a 128K context window. These models are the leading open source models, according to Artificial Analysis benchmarks, and excel at reasoning and agentic workflows. With Amazon SageMaker AI, you can fine-tune or customize models and deploy with your choice of framework through a fully managed service. Amazon SageMaker Inference gives you the flexibility to bring your own inference code and framework without having to build and maintain your own clusters. Although large language models (LLMs) excel at understanding language and generating content, building real-world agentic applications requires complex workflow management, tool calling capabilities, and context management. Multi-agent architectures address these challenges by breaking down complex systems into specialized components, but they introduce new complexities in agent coordination, memory management, and workflow orchestration. In this post, we show how to deploy gpt-oss-20b model to SageMaker managed endpoints and demonstrate a practical stock analyzer agent assistant example with LangGraph, a powerful graph-based framework that handles state management, coordinated workflows, and persistent memory systems. We will then deploy our agents to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, a unified orchestration layer that abstracts away infrastructure and allows you to securely deploy and operate AI agents at scale. In this solution, we build an agentic stock analyzer with the following key components: The following diagram illustrates the solution architecture. This architecture illustrates a multi-agent workflow hosted on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime running on AWS. A user submits a query, which is handled by a pipeline of specialized agents—Data Gathering Agent, Stock Performance Analyzer Agent, and Stock Report Generation Agent—that are each responsible for a distinct part of the stock evaluation process. These agents collaborate within Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, and when language understanding or generation is required, they invoke a GPT OSS model hosted on SageMaker AI. The model processes the input and returns structured outputs that inform agent actions, enabling a fully serverless, modular, and scalable agentic system using open-source models. Customers who want to customize their models and frameworks can deploy using serverful deployments, but this requires access to GPUs, serving frameworks, load balancers, and infrastructure setup. SageMaker AI provides a fully managed hosting platform that takes care of provisioning the infrastructure with the necessary drivers, downloads the models, and deploys them. OpenAI’s GPT-OSS models are launched with a 4-bit quantization scheme (MXFP4), enabling fast inference while keeping resource usage low. These models can run on P5(H100), P6(H200), and P4(A100) and G6e(L40) instances.The GPT-OSS models are sparse MoE architectures with 128 experts (120B) or 32 experts (20B), where each token is routed to 4 experts with no shared expert. Using MXFP4 for MoE weights alone reduces the model sizes to 63 GB (120B) and 14 GB (20B), making them runnable on a single H100 GPU. To deploy these models effectively, you need a powerful serving framework like vLLM. To deploy the model, we build a vLLM container with the latest version that supports GPT OSS models on SageMaker AI. You can use the following Docker file and script to build the container and push it to a local Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR). The recommended approach is to do this directly from Amazon SageMaker Studio, which provides a managed JupyterLab environment with AWS CLI access where you can build and push images to ECR as part of your SageMaker workflow. Alternatively, you can also perform the same steps on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance with Docker installed. After you have built and pushed the container to Amazon ECR, you can open Amazon SageMaker Studio by going to the SageMaker AI console, as shown in the following screenshot. You can then create a Jupyter space or use an existing one to launch JupyterLab and run notebooks. Clone the following notebook and run “Option 3: Deploying from HF using BYOC.” Update the required parameters, such as the inference image in the notebook with the container image. We also provide necessary environment variables, as shown in the following code. After you set up the deployment configuration, you can deploy to SageMaker AI using the following code: You can now run an inference example: For our stock analyzing multi-agent system, we use LangGraph to orchestrate the workflow. Jupyter notebook for the code is located in this github repository. The system comprises three specialized tools that work together to analyze stocks comprehensively: For local testing, you can use a simplified version of the system by importing the necessary functions from your local script. For example: This way, you can iterate quickly on your agent’s logic before deploying it to a scalable platform, making sure each component functions correctly and the overall workflow produces the expected results for different types of stocks. After you have developed and tested your LangGraph framework locally, you can deploy it to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore handles the heavy lifting of container orchestration, session management, scalability and abstracting the management of infrastructure. It provides persistent execution environments that can maintain an agent’s state across multiple invocations. Before deploying our stock analyzer agent to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, we need to create an AWS Identity and Access Management IAM role with the appropriate permissions. This role allows Amazon Bedrock AgentCore to invoke your SageMaker endpoint for GPT-OSS model inference, manage ECR repositories for storing container images, write Amazon CloudWatch logs for monitoring and debugging, access Amazon Bedrock AgentCore workload services for runtime operations, and send telemetry data to AWS X-Ray and CloudWatch for observability. See the following code: After creating the role, you can use the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Starter Toolkit to deploy your agent. The toolkit simplifies the deployment process by packaging your code, creating the necessary container image, and configuring the runtime environment: When you’re using BedrockAgentCoreApp, it automatically creates an HTTP server that listens on port 8080, implements the required /invocations endpoint for processing the agent’s requirements, implements the/ping endpoint for health checks (which is very important for asynchronous agents), handles proper content types and response formats, and manages error handling according to AWS standards. After you deploy to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, you will be able to see the status show as Ready on the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore console. After you create the agent, you must set up the agent invocation entry point. With Amazon AgentCore Runtime, we decorate the invocation part of our agent with the @app.entrypoint decorator and use it as the entry point for our runtime. After you deploy the agent to Amazon AgentCore Runtime, you can invoke it using the AWS SDK: After invoking the stock analyzer agent through Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, you must parse and format the response for clear presentation. The response processing involves the following steps: The system also includes error handling that gracefully handles JSON parsing errors, falls back to plain text display if structured parsing fails, and provides debugging information for troubleshooting parsing issues of the stock analysis response. This formatted output makes it straightforward to review the agent’s decision-making process and present professional stock analysis results to stakeholders, completing the end-to-end workflow from model deployment to meaningful business output: You can delete the SageMaker endpoint to avoid accruing costs after your testing by running the following cells in the same notebook: You can also delete Amazon Bedrock AgentCore resources using the following commands: In this post, we built an end-to-end solution for deploying OpenAI’s open-weight models on a single G6e(L40s) GPU, creating a multi-agent stock analysis system with LangGraph and deploying it seamlessly with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore. This implementation demonstrates how organizations can now use powerful open source LLMs cost-effectively with efficient serving frameworks such as vLLM. Beyond the technical implementation, enhancing this workflow can provide significant business value, such as reduction in stock analysis processing time, increased analyst productivity by automating routine stock assessments. Furthermore, by freeing analysts from repetitive tasks, organizations can redirect skilled professionals toward complex cases and relationship-building activities that drive business growth. We invite you to try out our code samples and iterate your agentic workflows to meet your use cases. Vivek Gangasani is a Worldwide Lead GenAI Specialist Solutions Architect for SageMaker Inference.

Title: Honeywell, Caterpillar CTOs say AI can ease labor, skills gaps in manufacturing

John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. Honeywell says that 20% of the company’s software code is written by GitHub Copilot and other AI-assistant coding tools. But, does that mean that the industrial giant’s embrace of AI has corresponded with a 20% reduction in that team’s workforce? No, according to Suresh Venkatarayalu, the chief technology officer and president of the company’s software-focused division, Honeywell Connected Enterprise. “What has changed is the type of developer skill sets,” said Venkatarayalu at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference held last week in Park City, Utah. With less time needed to write code, Honeywell’s software developers can perform more complex work, including spending more time in the field with customers to solve their system integration needs. For decades, the industrial sector has been embracing automation technologies that have made it easier to move goods across the factory floor, perform quality control inspections, and monitor machinery to predict when a fix may be in order before any breakdowns occur. Workers have also gotten more access to AI-enabled tools, helping recommend when supplies need reordering, predict demand from customers, and help handle repetitive back-office tasks. AI represents yet another new way to rethink manufacturing automation. Many are still early in their adoption journey, with only 29% using AI or machine learning at the factory or network level, and just one out of four having deployed generative AI at that scale, according to a survey of 600 executives from large manufacturing companies by consultancy Deloitte. Jaime Mineart, SVP and CTO of construction and mining equipment manufacturer Caterpillar, joined Venkatarayalu during the panel discussion and shared leaders need to change how their workers engage with technology. That might include classes in prompt engineering, so they know how to get the most out of large language models, specialized training in how to work alongside robots, or lessons on how to glean insights from the data streaming from a more connected manufacturing ecosystem. “It’s huge change management,” Mineart said. The biggest challenges that they will need to solve will be related to both labor capability and labor availability, she added. Venkatarayalu sees things slightly differently. In the U.S. and other developed markets, he believes that there is a labor shortage. But in higher growth regions, the problem is more focused on the skills gap. “The only way to offset the labor shortage and a skills shortage is to augment with something, and that something is AI,” said Venkatarayalu. A survey conducted by the National Association of Manufacturers last year found that nearly 60% of manufacturers report that their inability to attract and retain employees is their top challenge. A separate study by Deloitte and The Manufacturing Institute last year showed that 1.9 million U.S. manufacturing jobs could go unfilled over a decade if the talent woes aren’t addressed. Meanwhile, the median tenure of a manufacturing worker has slipped from 5.9 years in 2014 to 4.9 years in 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Mineart said automation and AI can help move workers away from less safe, duller, and more repetitive tasks. “Those are jobs that robots, robotics, and technology can really do very, very well, alongside that human capability and that human creativity to get more productivity and safer work sites,” she said. Caterpillar and Honeywell share some similarities in that they are both over a century old and are on the Fortune 500 (Caterpillar at 64, Honeywell at 119). But their AI journeys are evolving in different ways. Honeywell, which is in the process of splitting itself into three different companies, has launched new generative AI features for customers including an AI assistant to automate tasks for operators and production workers and has inked partnerships with Google, Chevron, and Qualcomm to collaborate more on AI innovation. Caterpillar’s revenue is getting a boost from the data center boom that’s leading to stronger sales of the company’s generators. It has also pledged $100 million over the next five years to upskill workers on evolving technologies, including AI. “When you think about bringing manufacturing back into the United States, we have to reimagine how we are going to do that,” said Mineart. John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. Momentum continues to build for quantum. While the most promising advancements for quantum computing look to be at least a few years away, excitement for the developing field is accelerating as seen by a Wall Street Journal report last week that quantum computing startup PsiQuantum raised $1 billion from investors including BlackRock and Nvidia’s venture-capital arm to bring the company’s total valuation to $7 billion. There’s been quite a bit of funding action in the space in recent weeks, with Honeywell’s quantum computing company, Quantinuum, and Europe’s IQM Quantum Computers both disclosing funding rounds earlier this month. WSJ also separately reported on IBM’s efforts to lead in the space, which includes a partnership with chip maker AMD to develop “quantum-centric supercomputers.” Automation is more popular than augmentation for Anthropic’s Claude. Anthropic, the AI startup whose CEO warned that the technology could wipe out 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs in five years, published a broad report this week that found that 77% of enterprises’ usage of Claude AI software was focused on automation, with just 12% for augmentation (which includes improved collaboration and learning). Peter McCrory, head of economics at Anthropic, told Bloomberg that it wasn’t clear whether the increase in automation was due to “new model capabilities that are expanding the set of things that get automated, or if it’s people being more comfortable with large language models and becoming more willing to delegate certain tasks to Claude.” As OpenAI spends big, questions begin to swirl on the startup’s monetization strategy. Wall Street cheered the news of Oracle’s $300 billion cloud deal last week, an OpenAI halo that’s also lifting the valuations of key investor Microsoft, AI chip maker Nvidia, and Broadcom, the latter seeing a stock pop after it was reported that OpenAI placed a $10 billion order for its custom AI chips. The thesis of all this investment is that enterprises and individual customers will spend on AI at exponentially higher rates than they are today, to justify the hundreds of billions of dollars that OpenAI is putting into AI infrastructure. That’s not necessarily a guarantee, with studies and surveys beginning to call into question the success of generative AI pilots and very few paying individual customers. While nearly two billion individuals use AI, only 3% of them are paying for premium services, which includes ChatGPT, according to a study by Menlo Ventures. AI skills are becoming a job requirement A report on the Group of 7 nations found that 78% of all tech roles now include at least some AI skills and that seven of the 10 fastest-growing tech roles are related to AI. The highest in-demand roles that saw the largest year-over-over growth are AI risk and governance specialist (234%), NLP engineer (186%), AL/ML engineer (145%), AI business consultant (134%), and AI infrastructure engineer (124%), according to a study published by the AI Workforce Consortium, a group of ten large employers that includes Google, Intel, Cisco, Microsoft, and SAP. Beyond merely hiring new talent for those roles, AI Workforce Consortium is also advocating for more upskilling, saying that tech skills like prompt engineering, conversational AI, and generative AI require “immediate” intervention to cater to the job market demand. “I think there has been a gap, for quite some time, between higher education and corporations,” Fran Katsoudas, Cisco's chief people, policy and purpose officer, tells Fortune. Those gaps were initially focused on soft skills, including learning how to collaborate on a project or respectfully disagree. Now, corporations will need to take that same college-to-work skills gap playbook and apply it to AI. “Part of the challenge is when companies think about training or education, we make it very individualized,” adds Katsoudas. “Enterprise education has to be more team- and roll-based.” Courtesy of The AI Workforce Consortium Hiring: - Jefferson Center for Mental Health is seeking a CIO, based in Wheat Ridge, Colorado.

Title: End Quarterly Earnings Forecasts But Not Quarterly Reporting
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelposner/2025/09/17/end-quarterly-earnings-forecasts-but-not-quarterly-reporting/
Time Published: 2025-09-17T18:53:00Z

ByMichael Posner, Senior Contributor. President Donald Trump has proposed reducing the frequency of corporate financial reporting requirements from four reports a year to two. He made the same suggestion in 2018. Trump justifies this idea by saying, “This will save money and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.” He is only half right: the reduced reporting will indeed save companies money. But at the same time, it will reduce transparency, denying investors, government regulators, and the public access to essential information that is of broad public concern. This is yet another example of the administration’s efforts to roll back data collection and dissemination on a wide range of topics. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has required publicly traded companies to file quarterly financial reports since 1970. These reports provide a snapshot of financial performance, a collection of unaudited financial statements, such as balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements. These numbers help investors assess a company's growth, profitability, and financial health. But in the wake of the president’s announcement, the SEC now says that it is prioritizing his proposal “to further eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens on companies.” This is the latest in a series of administration steps aimed at reducing government oversight of corporate actions. It’s important to separate the two different aspects of the corporate reporting process. The first is the role these reports play in generating data that investors use to make quarterly earnings forecasts. These forecasts reinforce the investment model for many on Wall Street, prioritizing the maximization of short-term shareholder profits at the expense of a company’s long-term value. Extending the reporting period from three to six months will do very little to correct this investor-driven short-termism, which disincentivizes C-suite executives who wish to invest in environmental and social safeguards. In 2018, Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett wrote an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, which rightly called for the end to quarterly earnings forecasts. They wrote, “in our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability.” But they also stressed that this “should not be misconstrued as opposition to quarterly and annual reporting.” Rather, they emphasized that, “[tr]ansparency about financial and operating results is an essential aspect of U.S. public markets.” Dimon and Buffett are not alone in this assessment. FCLTGlobal, a non-profit that began as a joint initiative of BlackRock, McKinsey, the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Fund, and others, also promotes longer-term thinking in finance. A report they published in 2017 argues that the publication of “[q]uarterly earnings remains essential in providing investors with the transparency they need and in keeping management teams accountable for their performance.” FCLTGlobal suggests that instead of reducing reporting requirements, companies should be encouraged to incorporate long-term goals in their public reporting and to discuss the progress they are making toward these goals each quarter. The second reason for doing these reports, called 10-Q filings, is to provide investors and the public with information on a range of topics that enhance corporate transparency and provide a measure of accountability. This is more important than ever in the current political moment, when the Trump administration is relaxing federal ethical standards and enforcement of laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. On their own, quarterly financial reports cannot reverse this current trend, but they can provide a hedge against the most egregious conduct. To paraphrase former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, “Sunlight is the best disinfectant.”10-Q reports are divided into two parts. The first includes financial statements, disclosures about market risks, analysis of the company’s financial situation by management, and discussion of its internal controls. These disclosures give individual and institutional investors the information they need to make informed investment decisions. The second part of these reports covers a range of other topics that helps investors and the public identify potential risks, such as whether there are legal or default proceedings pending against the company, or the unregistered sales of equity securities. Not surprisingly, this is information that company leaders often are not eager to disclose. Under the law, they must. This provides all of us with an important source of accountability. As the Wall Street Journal has reported, the President’s proposal is likely to meet resistance from investors. The Journal wrote, “Institutional investors such as pension funds and hedge funds typically crave more information on the companies they follow, not less.” And as T. Rowe Price has observed, even longer-term investors benefit from quarterly reports, “because these short-term progress reports increase our confidence in our ability to predict a company’s long-range outcome.” In an era of increasing corporate power and declining regulatory oversight, maintaining robust quarterly reporting requirements isn’t just good policy—it’s essential for market integrity and public accountability.

The portfolios, aimed at both private wealth and institutional clients, will combine public and private market exposure across multiple asset classes. September 17, 2025 PGIM and Partners Group formed a strategic partnership to construct multi-asset portfolios for individual and institutional clients. PGIM operates a $1 trillion credit platform that includes public fixed income and private credit investments, in addition to managing a large commercial real estate portfolio. Partners Group specializes in private equity and infrastructure investments. The two firms plan to create a suite of investment products focused on broad diversification across public and private markets and multiple asset classes. These investments will be available as either stand-alone options or as parts of defined contribution plans and insurance portfolios. “Given our unique position as an insurance-backed asset manager and one of the top global asset managers for defined contribution plans, we are well-suited to provide solutions that are differentiated and scalable across various client segments,” said Stuart Parker, head of global wealth at PGIM, in a statement. “Our partnership with Partners Group deepens our firm’s ability to provide clients with market-leading, innovative and comprehensive multi-asset investment solutions that meet their evolving needs.” A statement from David Layton, CEO of Partners Group, noted: “Today, we combine our transformational investing approach with the ability to tailor flexible portfolio solutions to meet a broad range of investor requirements. This partnership with PGIM stands testament to that and is another important step in broadening access to private markets for a range of end clients.” Related:Wealth Management Invest: The Role of Secondary Markets in Private Wealth with Coller Capital’s Jonathan McEvoy The partnerships add to a trend of asset manager team-ups to deliver products that blend exposures to public and private assets. Last fall, Partners Group formed a partnership with alternative asset manager BlackRock to launch a model portfolio encompassing private equity, private credit and real assets. Those models were aimed at investors with qualified purchaser status. Other asset managers, including Goldman Sachs and T. Rowe, KKR and Capital Group, Blackstone and Vanguard, have teamed up over the past year to build and launch model portfolios, SMAs and evergreen funds that combine public and private market exposure. This is happening as both private wealth investors and their financial advisors increasingly see alternative assets as a must-have in clients’ investment portfolios—a report by FUSE Research Network published in January projected that by 2029, alternative assets in the U.S. wealth management channel could rise to $3.03 trillion, or at an annualized compound growth rate of 17%.

Title: Rick Rieder Overhauls BlackRock Bond Team as HPS Clout Grows

(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. is revamping its massive fixed-income division around new investment strategies and artificial intelligence, as the unit’s leveraged finance business moves under an executive team from the firm’s newly acquired HPS Investment Partners. The changes mark a new vision for the group and reflect the credit market’s “dramatic and transformative” evolution, Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, said in an internal memo seen by Bloomberg. The move also underscores the growing clout of the private financing solutions group led by HPS’s top executives — a key business for the firm as it expands in private and alternative credit and competes with the likes of Blackstone Inc. and Apollo Global Management Inc. BlackRock’s leveraged-finance business will remain under the stewardship of David Delbos and Mitch Garfin, but will be folded into the PFS business from global fixed income, according to the memo. The PFS franchise is overseen by Scott Kapnick, Scot French and Michael Patterson, the HPS leaders who completed the $12 billion sale of the private-credit specialist to BlackRock in July. A representative for the company declined to comment. It’s the latest move in a sweeping plan to re-wire BlackRock. Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink is staking a big part of his company’s future on private markets and his ability to combine them with the public stock and bond strategies and ETFs that have powered the firm’s rise. BlackRock has spent billions to become a major player in alternative and private assets and data, and the HPS purchase turned it into a private-credit behemoth nearly overnight. Rieder, who met last week with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the role of Federal Reserve chair, laid out new investment plans for BlackRock’s fixed-income group in the memo. It will build out core fixed-income portfolios and plans to develop a so-called core-plus-related solution that is “more powerful,” he said. As part of the changes, Rieder said Russ Brownback will become deputy CIO of global fixed income. David Rogal, meanwhile, has informed the company that he intends to explore opportunities outside the firm, Rieder said. Bank of America Corp.’s David Koh will join BlackRock in a newly created role as chief investment strategist, he added. Rieder’s group plans to start a fixed-income hedge fund dubbed TriaXial, he said. It also intends to develop a higher-income version of BINC, a popular active bond ETF with $12.3 billion in assets that Rieder manages. He is responsible for roughly $2.4 trillion in total, according to the firm’s website. “Technology will be a significant part of the work,” said Rieder. “The ability to use AI, machine learning and new data” will help develop new tools to improve investment returns. --With assistance from Laura Noonan and Jeremy Hill.

Title: Watch These Alphabet Stock Price Levels After Google Parent Joins the $3 Trillion Club

Full Content:
Alphabet (GOOGL) this week became just the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, boosted by a favorable legal ruling and optimism about the company's prospects amid the AI boom. The tech giant joined Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) in the exclusive club. Alphabet shares surged in recent weeks after a federal judge ruled that Google doesn't have to sell its Chrome browser to remedy an antitrust case. Investors have also cheered the integration of Google’s AI tools across its ad and cloud business. Alphabet shares were down 1% at around $248 in early-afternoon trading Wednesday, leaving the company's market cap hovering near $3 trillion. Despite today's decline, the stock has gained about 17% since the start of September and is up 30% since the start of the year. Below, we dial into Alphabet’s technicals and point out key price levels worth watching out for. Since breaking out from a saucer pattern in late August, Alphabet shares have continued to trend sharply higher this month. While the relative strength index confirms bullish momentum with a reading nearing 90, the indicator also warns of heated conditions, potentially leading to short-term price fluctuations and profit taking. It’s also worth noting that the price formed a spinning top candlestick pattern in Tuesday’s trading session, signaling indecision among buyers and sellers. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast where the stock could be headed if the rally continues and also point out key support levels worth monitoring. Investors can forecast two possible bullish price targets on Alphabet’s chart by using the measuring principle, a technique that analyzes chart patterns to project future price movements. To apply the analysis, we calculate the distance of the saucer pattern from its low to high and add that to the formation’s top trendline value. When calculating the distance in points, we add $60 to $201, which forecasts a target of $261. ($60 + 201). Alternatively, we can measure the distance as a percentage change, which projects a target of $286.53. (applying a 42.55% increase to $201). The first support level to eye sits around $215. This location on the chart may attract buying interest on a fill of the stock’s antitrust news-driven breakaway gap. Finally, selling below this level could see Alphabet shares retest a key floor at $201, currently situated just under the rising 50-day moving average. Investors may look to accumulate shares in this region near the saucer pattern’s top trendline, which may flip from prior resistance into future support.

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed at midday ahead of a highly anticipated decision on interest rates from the Federal Reserve. The Dow advanced, but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell. Workday (WDAY) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 after activist investor Elliott Investment Management said it took a more than $2 billion stake in the human resources software provider and complemented management on its strategy. Lyft (LYFT) shares soared after Google parent Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Waymo announced an expanded partnership to bring robotaxi service to Nashville starting next year. Shares of rival ridesharing giant Uber (UBER) slumped. U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba (BABA) climbed following a report China Unicom will purchase its artificial intelligence semiconductors. Nvidia (NVDA) shares slid following a report China has blocked the sale of the U.S. company's AI chips to tech companies there. A number of other chipmakers and AI investor favorites, including Broadcom (AVGO), Oracle (ORCL), and Palantir (PLTR), also lost ground. Oil and gold futures edged lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro but lost ground to the pound and yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were higher.

Listen to the Stepchange Show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you listen to podcasts. Welcome to the third episode of the Stepchange Show—where we explore the technologies and systems that have transformed human civilization. Every time you stream a movie, send a text message, scroll a feed, or chat with your favorite AI, you’re touching an invisible, physical empire. We call it the cloud, but it isn’t in the sky. It is astonishingly physical—alive in over 12,000 buildings around the world, consuming almost five percent of U.S. electricity, and running through cables laid across the ocean floor. This is the story of data centers. From the humming punch-card rooms of the 1930s to the Cold War projects that accidentally birthed the internet, and onward to the gigawatt-scale AI factories of today, data centers have quietly become the industrial engine of our era. Six companies—NVIDIA, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta—now dominate global markets in part because they command this infrastructure, just as railroads, steel, and oil once defined the fortunes of the last century. Data centers are the machines behind the modern world. They shape commerce, media, communication, and now artificial intelligence, and raise profound questions about energy, water, and climate. Join us as we uncover the physical reality of our digital world. Four main parts: Part I — Early Mainframes and the Birth of the Internet - 00:00:00Part II — The Utility of the Cloud and the Hyperscalers - 01:16:13Part III — The COVID Acceleration + AI Frenzy - 02:32:48Part IV — Themes & Reflections - 03:40:10 Chapter times:00:00:00 - The Invisible Empire of Data Centers00:03:11 - IBM Punch Cards: The First Nerve Center00:17:12 - SAGE: Connecting the Mainframes00:27:27 - The APARNET: The Cold War Births the Internet00:49:15 - The .Com Boom: The World Gets Wired01:16:13 - AWS: The Utility of the Cloud01:36:25 - Google: Warehouse Scale Computers01:58:28 - Microsoft: From Software to Services02:18:19 - Facebook: Sharing the Blueprints02:32:48 - COVID: Five Years of Growth in 18 Months02:45:53 - AI: The Dawn of the AI Age, Powered by NVIDIA02:53:46 - Power & Water: The Gigawatt Problem03:10:48 - Chips & Data: The New Cold War03:19:18 - Climate: The Emissions of Data Centers03:33:43 - Present Day Scale: Compute, Storage, and Communication03:40:10 - Themes: Our Takeaways and Reflections Thank you for joining us for the third episode of Stepchange.

I love how back to school kind of feels like the beginning of a new year. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:00:11): It does. I always thought this time of year was the actual new year. Anay Shah (00:00:16): I like that. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:00:28): Welcome to the third episode of the Step Change Show. We're here to cover the stories of human progress. We want to understand the technologies, systems, and infrastructure that shape our world. I'm Ben Eidelson, a co-founder of Step Change Ventures, a fund that invests in the companies that are accelerating today's biggest step changes. I'm based up in Seattle, Washington. Anay Shah (00:00:46): And I'm Anay Shah, fellow co-founder of Step Change Ventures, based in Los Angeles, California. Today we're going to be telling the story of the hyperscale-up of a recent infrastructure: the story of data centers. Every time you stream a movie, send a text message, call a car to pick you up, or talk to what feels like a fully formed computational consciousness, you are touching an invisible physical empire. We call it the cloud, but it isn't in the sky. It lives somewhere very, very real. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:01:20): It lives in nearly 12,000 buildings worldwide, consuming almost 5% of electricity in the U.S. It also lives inside these garden-hose-sized cables that are laid across the darkest parts of the ocean floor. Today we are going to tell the story of this invisible infrastructure—a story that begins in the humming and clattering punch card rooms of the early 1900s, winds through the Cold War projects that accidentally birthed the internet, and leads to the gigawatt-scale AI factories the size of Lower Manhattan that are being built today. Anay Shah (00:01:50): The U.S. stock market is worth around $60 trillion, made up of over 4,000 companies. But there are just six companies at the top—Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta—that make up 30% of that market. They are today's railroads, steel, and oil companies, building the modern industrial engine of our time. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:02:12): This is the story of data centers. But before we do, just one quick note: We have all of the research links and notes for this episode up at StepChangeShow. And if you are listening to this and you think of a friend or colleague who might enjoy it, please send it over their way. All of this is a new endeavor for us, and we appreciate it getting into the hands—or rather ears—of folks who may dig it. All right, so data centers. Anay Shah (00:02:36): So Ben, I was recently reading an article saying these new technologies are saving work for everyone nowadays. Pretty soon we'll have nothing to do at all. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:02:44): That's right. I think they were saying that we have some new electronic brain that's going to make most workers obsolete. Anay Shah (00:02:49): Right. But the CEO behind one of these technologies quickly countered, saying that it was a way to save time, not replace jobs. He said it was a small tool to help great minds benefit mankind. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:03:00): Was this the CEO of Anthropic, OpenAI, or maybe Google? Anay Shah (00:03:04): You might think so, but no. This was Thomas J. Watson Sr., the original leader of IBM. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:03:11): So, IBM, the computational powerhouse of the last century. Long before we had the Googles, Amazons, Metas, and Microsofts, there was Big Blue IBM. And long before IBM ever built an electronic computer, they were doing computation of a different sort. Anay Shah (00:03:32): And if you walked into a large company back in the 1930s, you might find yourself in one of their windowless rooms, humming and clattering like a small factory. There'd be long rows of metal cabinets, whirring gears, and clerks feeding stacks of stiff paper cards into these behemoth machines. Each card was a sliver of information: an employee's hours, an invoice, maybe a customer's address. But together, they formed the first centralized nerve center for corporate data. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:04:05): And I think that's why we argue that those rooms, with those cards of information being processed on these devices that were doing computing, are the first real data centers. Anay Shah (00:04:17): That machine has quite an interesting history, born to solve a government problem: the problem of the U.S. census. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:04:26): It's wild. The 1880 census data was collected in 1880, and it took seven years before it was tabulated. They realized it just was not working at human computation scale anymore. Anay Shah (00:04:37): And so one man, Herman Hollerith, had an invention to solve this. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:04:42): He observed the way railroad conductors checked tickets, noting that these were papers with punched-out holes that ultimately stored and represented information. If you could build a machine that could count the number of punch holes, you could then do computation at scale without needing humans to count markdowns on a form. Anay Shah (00:05:05): That's right. These cards stored information, and then you could have machines compute off of them. The 1890 census was the machine's first big break. Even with a population 25% larger than the decade before, it was completed in two years instead of more than seven years, and it came $5 million under budget. That's not something a new technology could typically achieve for a government. So, fast forward to Watson. He sees the punch card machine and understands what it can do. By the mid-1920s, he's convinced. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:05:37): So by 1924, he rebranded the company International Business Machines. Anay Shah (00:05:42): A much more fitting name than CTR. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:05:47): Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company. Anay Shah (00:05:50): "There is no limit for this tabulating business," he told his executives in 1927. He doubled down, selling off all the other less promising lines of business and pouring the company's resources into the tabulating division. They designed a proprietary 80-column IBM card that only worked on IBM machines, which became the IBM card—a sort of early-days lock-in where customers who wanted to use the machines had to buy the cards. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:06:22): Everyone obsesses over the Gillette razor blade business model, but the IBM card was not only how you did the computation, but it also stored information and became your record-keeping method inside businesses running on these IBM machines. Anay Shah (00:06:35): Once you put invoices, time cards, and all of that information onto the IBM card, you're not migrating it off. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:06:41): It's on a piece of paper. Anay Shah (00:06:42): Yeah, that's right. So now you've produced a very steady stream of revenue alongside selling the tabulator machine. The timing for this was perfect. This is the late '20s, early '30s. The New Deal brought in a massive government focus around record-keeping. In 1935, the Social Security Administration signed a contract with IBM, requiring millions of their cards and machines to process benefits and print checks. One of their New York plants was soon printing 10 million cards per day. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:07:14): It's amazing. Anay Shah (00:07:15): And within a couple decades, most large companies had punch card rooms. They had various machines they used to sort, tabulate, and store financial information, payroll information, employee information, customer information—everything you could think of. In order to manage that, they'd hire clerks and technical specialists to operate and maintain it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:07:36): It's easy to take for granted, but this was the first time a company, its accounting, and its invoicing could be calculated at this scale. Think about what was going on in this era: companies were starting to scale in new ways. More global trade was also starting to happen. Thomas Watson Sr. ended up very interested in diplomacy, traveling around the world trying to preach that commerce across borders would create peace. Unfortunately, this backfired. He did a lot of commerce with Germany in the lead-up to the Holocaust, and there are many stories around IBM's computational power being used to help Germans with record-keeping. Ultimately, this product was foundational to so much of the scale of this era, including the scale of war. Every time there was a war or a big government project, regardless of which country was fighting, they needed IBM machines to do calculations. Anay Shah (00:08:34): This was the way to process and store information. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:08:38): But it was all still cards and mechanical switches, ultimately. Anay Shah (00:08:42): And rooms full of paper. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:08:44): Rooms of paper. So everyone was running on punch cards. What was this thing? What was this room? What should we call it? Anay Shah (00:08:50): This is where we're going to put our stake in the ground and say the earliest data centers came out of the IBM punch card data center. The easiest way to understand it is: it's a physical space or a collection of facilities designed to house and operate an organization's data and computing infrastructure. You can think of it as primarily storing information, computing information, and over time, connecting and allowing for the communication of information. At its basic core, a data center in the evolution we're going to talk about from the mid-1900s to the present day is the physical space around storage, computing, and connectivity. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:09:33): At this moment, IBM was already a growing company of import, right? Doing global international business. By 1945, they had around 25,000 employees and annual revenue of approximately $140 million. But something was about to change, and that was also coming out of the war. World War II was this big moment of government investment in R&D. One of the things they often found themselves doing was calculating artillery firing tables, which took into account the wind speed, weather, and all these different factors to figure out where they should shoot artillery. There were teams of human computers, clerks who were doing mechanical calculation to figure things out. But that was a bottleneck. So the army funded a team at the University of Pennsylvania to build the first real electronic computer, a machine that could crank through those calculations an order of magnitude faster. That became the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, also known as ENIAC. Anay Shah (00:10:33): This was all about math. It was focused on calculating numbers and producing mathematical results that would help them, in this case, be more efficient in war planning. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:10:44): Yeah, I mean, they didn't have the... Anay Shah (00:10:45): TI-83 or the games that go on it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:10:48): It, or the games that go on it. They didn't have Tetris. So they needed a calculator that could go faster than the people who were a bottleneck at this point. The ENIAC had no mechanical parts that slowed its operation. It took up nearly a 2,000-square-foot room, but it did operate over 1,000 times faster than any previous computational device. It could execute 5,000 additions per second. At this time, IBM, with its commercial product—the quickest punch card machine—could complete just four additions a second. So it wasn't an order of magnitude faster; it was three orders of magnitude faster. Anay Shah (00:11:25): Four additions per second to 5,000 additions per second. This seems like something mathematicians and CEOs privy to this would think, "Oh, I can see the future." But no. A distinguished Harvard mathematician dismissed the idea as foolishness, saying there would be no big market for computers. He believed that the country would need maybe half a dozen, mainly for military and scientific research. Our friend Thomas J. Watson Sr. said general-purpose computers had nothing whatsoever to do with IBM or IBM's mainline of equipment and profitability. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:11:59): But Watson's stubbornness to stay wedded to the past was only matched and maybe outdone by his son's stubbornness to push the company forward. Anay Shah (00:12:09): Runs in the family, but takes a different shape. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:12:12): This is a father-and-son story for the ages. Thomas Watson Jr. eventually fought in the war, came back, and was ready to take his seat as a leader inside IBM. He viewed electronics as the future of the company, and this became the intergenerational battle for the control of IBM. Thomas Watson Jr. saw that there was a future for the company in electronics and wanted to push it that way. Anay Shah (00:12:38): There's some interesting parent-child psychology where you can see him completely frustrated and angry that his father's not going to jump on what he thinks is very clearly the future. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:12:50): IBM did do a wartime project with Harvard mathematician Howard Aiken that was a kind of hybrid electromechanical vacuum-tube machine. They followed that with their first machine that they really wanted to demonstrate to the public after the war. This was called the Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator (SSEC). This was in 1948. They showed that in a Madison Avenue showroom, right in the middle of Manhattan, so that people could walk by and see this thing computing. Anay Shah (00:13:20): And to see this thing, these machines were still the size of rooms. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:13:25): And it was fast, not by today's standards, but by those days, it was very fast. It didn't have any memory in the sense that we were used to computers today having memory, but it had this punched paper tape as a form of storage. Despite Thomas Watson Sr. not liking this as the new business, he didn't mind the company getting some PR points for it. They'd send reporters down to watch the machine do computation. This is the moment when the press said, "Pretty soon no one's going to have a job to do as a result of this electronic brain." Anay Shah (00:13:54): The electronic brain that would displace workers. And so, in 1951, IBM's longtime customer, the U.S. Census Bureau, went with Univac instead of IBM tabulators for its next census. Thomas Watson Jr. recalls this moment, saying, "My God, Univac is smart enough to start taking all the civilian business away!" This is really what shakes IBM to once again reinvent itself. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:14:22): You go back to 1880, 1890. This whole invention was for the census problem. And that problem gets harder: more people, more things you want to know about people, and more factors you want to track. And so, that is actually a perfect test bed for computation at this time. Here comes the ENIAC team, now commercialized with Univac, and that wakes IBM right up. Anay Shah (00:14:41): And this company's been growing, right? IBM, in 1940, was doing about $45 million in revenue with 12,000 employees. And a decade later, they're doing $250 million in revenue with 30,000 employees. And if you're betting the company on a new direction, things could go south for a lot of people. It's a big responsibility for Watson Jr. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:15:02): And they pushed forward. And so, out of these early computer experiments, they finally built their first commercial product, which was the IBM 701 Electronic Data Processing Machine. This is the first real machine where they thought, "Hey, we're going to build more than one of these, and we're going to sell some of them. We're actually going to try and make this into a business, not just a research project." Anay Shah (00:15:20): And as we'll see with some of the companies closer to the present day, they had an installed base of customers; they had a sales machine. And so, they started this business line, and within five years, they had 85% of the computer market. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:15:34): That's right. So, that team that invented the first vacuum tube computer in the ENIAC and then the Univac, they got outrun by the better commercial go-to-market sales machine that, if you remember, IBM was founded with. So, who was buying these things, and how many did they sell? Well, the 701 was still a pretty bespoke product. They sold 19. These were going to National Labs, the Weather Bureau, and a lot of aerospace firms that were doing a lot of calculations. And the whole business model was actually not around buying these machines; it was an extension of the tabulating business model that IBM had always had, where they wanted you to lease the machine, rent it, and buy punch cards. Anay Shah (00:16:08): We got hardware as a service. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:16:10): Exactly. It was a beautiful business model. The era of the '50s for IBM was going from this research-centered product to what I'd consider their Model T. So, in this era, they built the first disk drive. They started using tape in addition to punch cards. They wrote Fortran, which is the first real kind of modern programming language where you could write words, and it would get translated into computer instructions by the end of the decade. In 1959, they launched the IBM 1401, which was available to thousands of companies. And they ended up selling around 12,000 of those machines. They exited the decade with a real... Anay Shah (00:16:45): computing business, and they're dominating the market. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:16:48): So, that first machine shipped 19 systems. They had another machine that shipped 123. After that, they had the first transistorized Model T. The 1401 crossed over 10,000 units. From 1950 to 1962, IBM's revenue rose tenfold, from $260 million to $2.6 billion. And their headcount went from 30,000 employees to almost 130,000 employees. Woo! Anay Shah (00:17:12): And so, what else is happening right now? We're in the 1950s; World War II has ended. The Cold War is getting colder. And we find that the Soviet Union's long-range nuclear-armed bombers are able to cross the Arctic and reach American cities in a matter of hours. So, this makes the decision window to detect and intercept down to two minutes. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:17:36): It's easy to forget, but the Cold War was primarily a technological arms race. Who's going to get there faster if something's going down? If the Soviet Union launches these bombers, how quickly can we respond, know about it, and then respond? And our Air Force and our defense systems were not designed for that speed. Anay Shah (00:17:53): Yeah, every threat forced a technology upgrade, forced our government to respond, to invest. We had a laboratory project at MIT that, in 1951, could process live radar data in real time, proving that automation could close this gap that we were seeing in national security. The challenge was: how do you take this radar research prototype and turn it into a 24/7 machine that can operate at government scale? And this is a moment that became the largest computing project to date. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:18:23): Thomas Watson Jr. saw this, and he knew that they needed to win this contract. IBM actually had a policy of essentially making only 1% profit on any defense work, which they kept throughout this. But they said this would push them to the future. And so, the contract awarded in 1954 became one of the largest contracts ever, worth more than $500 million in 1950s dollars. Around $5.5 billion in today's dollars. And so, how did it work? What did it do at full deployment when they got there in the 1960s? It was a network that spanned 27 different centers, where each center had a pair of special IBM computers designed for this. In case one of them was being serviced or down, the other one would become primary. So they built redundancy into the network. And the scale was unprecedented. In total, it was 56 computers. These were acre-sized floors, with multi-megawatt power draw to these systems. And they were connected—connected over early modems. This was the moment that really drove the production of the modem, where you could actually have data sent over telephone lines. And so, they would lease special lines between these centers. Anay Shah (00:19:32): And these centers have characteristics that we're going to talk about more. You have redundancy built into this; you have building-level scale; you've got multiple facilities networked together. These end up being a lot of the same characteristics that drive data center growth and evolution decades later. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:19:52): That's right. And I feel like there's the scale of it, but I think the connectivity of this system is the difference. You have storage; you have compute, which was happening; but now you had connection and communication, because you want this center over here to respond to information that was computed over there. And so, this moment in history—the SAGE system, I think—is the first real time that machines were communicating with each other. Pretty big moment. Anay Shah (00:20:17): So, once we're able to do this in government, it's going to catch the eyes of other industries. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:20:23): The airlines had seen the SAGE project take off, and they were sitting there with a new problem on their hands. This was the '60s. Air flight was booming, and the way that reservations got processed was absolutely insane. You would call your travel agent; your travel agent would call the airline; and the airline would have to run clerks around, pulling cards out to book a seat. Supposedly it took up to 90 minutes. Anay Shah (00:20:49): Well, you had to figure out who had the middle seat in Row 17. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:20:52): Who had the middle seat, exactly. Anay Shah (00:20:54): How were you going to figure that out without looking up the card? Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:20:56): As American Airlines scaled to a real operational scale, it started to break down. So, they reached out to IBM, and they kicked off this project that would be known as Sabre. It was essentially a commercial version of the SAGE system. Two IBM mainframes were purpose-built, and would be connected over phone lines. Those systems would house the source of truth around the reservations. And there would be terminals. These weren't terminals with screens; these were terminals with paper where you'd still have a travel agent, but they would be querying over the terminal what seats were available. And things would be booked automatically. So, it would go from 90 minutes to seconds at a terminal. And it removed the clerk in the middle. This set the stage for e-commerce. This was the first time, I think, you were buying something over a computer. Anay Shah (00:21:44): You had 90 minutes to do a reservation, now down to seconds. And this scaled American Airlines operations by the mid-'60s to be able to do a full 40,000 reservations per day. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:21:55): Insane. This system continues to this day to be part of the backbone of airline booking. It's quite an amazing foundational moment where commerce is happening between data centers. And so, they were running airlines; they were doing these major government projects. Businesses were now buying the 1401 machine off the shelves. But there was a different problem. Entering the mid-'60s, all of these mainframes had their own accessories. There was no compatibility. So, in 1964, they launched the System/360. And that turned this chaotic, messy, ad hoc world of different mainframe models into a platform. It was essentially one architecture; you could choose how powerful you wanted... Anay Shah (00:22:38): it to be, buy your base package, and then feature it up based on what you need. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:22:42): That's right. And so, for facility planners, they could now plan a room and a facility, and then be able to scale up the machine as needed. I believe roughly $5 billion of investment in R&D was spent in this era. Anay Shah (00:22:55): Another "bet the company" moment. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:22:57): And it worked. They were shipping thousands per month of these devices in the '60s. And so, if you zoom out and look across the '50s and '60s, as we talked about earlier. From the '50s to '62, they scaled to $2.6 billion. By 1970, they were doing $7.5 billion in annual revenue and had a team of 270,000 employees. Anay Shah (00:23:19): In today's dollars, that's $62 billion in revenue. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:23:23): And the market noticed. IBM was king at that moment. In 1970, IBM accounted for 6.8% of the total U.S. stock market. It almost feels like an unprecedented thing to say that today Nvidia is currently 7% of the U.S. stock market. Anay Shah (00:23:44): These mainframes became part of the zeitgeist. They became part of a cultural milieu because they were often nicknamed "the glass houses." You'd have the mainframes and their operators in an enclosed room. And as we mentioned before, you'd have windows and glass walls around it because you wanted to show off how automated your systems were, how advanced your company was. There was a recognition that these "glass houses"—these mainframes—were powering the billions of dollars of revenue from their enterprise customers. And so, the security, the operational control, the climate control, and cleanliness... It was all part of this cultural moment where mainframes and these early data centers became a meaningful part of how our society and economy ran. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:24:34): If any company was using it effectively, they had more demand for use than they had supply for the computer. And so, oftentimes, people would be sitting there waiting for their information to come back, for their computation to run. Sometimes it would be a day or longer, so the utilization was pretty high. But there was this long interactive latency problem. And an invention that echoes through in multiple ways to this day changed the fundamental way that computing was thought of: from this single-threaded "I'm only working on one problem at once" to "No." The job is to make sure my hardware is as utilized as possible. As a machine, I don't care whether or not it's the same problem from the same person. I just need to be calculating. Anay Shah (00:25:20): I need to be operating all the time to utilize my capacity. It can be for this problem; it can be for that problem. You can slot them in and out; it doesn't matter. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:25:29): That's right. And so, a team at MIT in the early '60s developed what was called CTSS, the Compatible Time-Sharing System, and turned it onto the campus in 1963. And so, students could sit there with electric typewriters and interact with this machine, multiple users at the same time, and feel like they had control over the computer. Anay Shah (00:25:52): It felt like it was your own. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:25:53): And this was a huge moment. This was the first time there were logins, users, files, and instant feedback. And so, it was revelatory to be there in the mid-'60s, experiencing that after the idea of a computer was just this operated thing by someone else. Anay Shah (00:26:09): That's right. You had to queue up, get in line, hand over your data to the operators—the specialists—who would then go and do their thing, and you would sit and wait. Now you're interacting. It's you and the computer. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:26:22): And the way this worked was that you didn't obviously have monopoly control over the computer. The computer was switching what problem it was working on, depending on what free cycles it had. The human perception is, "Oh, how can a computer do that?" Well, the computer is operating at a much faster frequency than we're able to realize. Even if it's something as simple as responding to a keystroke, there are plenty of milliseconds in between my keystroke and your keystroke for the computer to respond and then switch back to the other problem. And as we'll see later in this story, this notion of intelligently slicing up the hardware and utilizing it becomes the backbone of everything in how the cloud and data centers are architected today. And it started with this timesharing innovation. Well, we had these mainframes that had taken over the business world, and timesharing. So, multiple people could be on a campus connected to that mainframe, feeling like they had their own computer. They were still fully disconnected from anyone else in the world. They were still islands onto themselves. So yes, now on this island, multiple people could be there, but it's not like you could go visit the next-door island. What are we missing? Anay Shah (00:27:27): It's something we take quite for granted. Many people in different places, but working on the same system at the same time. Now remember, we are in the late 1950s, in the Cold War, and Eisenhower wanted to ensure that the U.S. would not be blindsided by a technological surprise. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:27:47): There's this particular moment right when everyone looked up in the sky and for the first time, a man-made thing was floating in space, and that's Sputnik. The fact that the Russians beat us to the skies with Sputnik kicked off, I think, a level of panic from a geopolitical standpoint that's hard to connect to today. Anay Shah (00:28:07): And so, after the panic of Sputnik, Eisenhower created the Advanced Research Projects Agency, or ARPA. And in those years, ARPA was pouring money into space, into missiles, into computing. And we wanted to ensure, in this nuclear-armed world, that weapons could not destroy a centralized command system. And so, the network itself needed to be decentralized. This need to ensure reliability combined with a slightly more mundane problem that Bob Taylor faced when he was at his office in the Pentagon: he was working at three terminals. He had one machine connected to MIT, another connected to UC Berkeley, and a third for a different research system altogether. And he could talk to any of them, but never at the same time. So he was rolling his chair back and forth, and he's quoted saying, "We ought to find a way to connect all of these different machines." He told his boss. After a 20-minute meeting, Taylor walked out with a million-dollar budget and a simple mandate: to make it happen. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:29:10): And we won't go into every moment and step because the ARPANET itself is quite a story. But I think a couple of innovations set the stage for the Internet in a really important way. One is the concept of packet switching. If you think about a phone line, AT&T built its whole business on this idea: you're going to connect a phone call between two people, and there's going to be a circuit that connects those two phones together. This is called circuit switching. But there's this crazy idea: if you want that resilient system so that if one node goes out, the next thing doesn't go out, you need to route things around in different ways and not be dependent on the one route you have. So, you need to have more of a spiderweb-like network to say, "Well, from here to here, there are actually five, or ideally 50 or 5,000, ways to get between those two points." And to do that, you need a flexible communication system. And so, the idea is to break up information into packets—little pieces of mail that would get sent from one node to another. Different packets could even take different routes, but on the other side, someone would reassemble them into the message. Anay Shah (00:30:15): It's the same singular message, broken up into many, many different pieces and routed through many, many different pathways. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:30:24): It's funny, I hadn't thought about this until we connected to the timesharing story, but it's actually about better utilization of the network. In a circuit-switched mode, you have this direct line; you and I have a direct line together, and you have a direct line to someone else. That line is usually empty. It's pretty hard to fully utilize and build out the circuit-switched thing because the phone call ends, and you think, "Okay, now it's just sitting there unused." In packet switching, packets are finding their way through this wild world. So, a lot of skepticism obviously came from AT&T, which said, "If you want to have two computers talk to each other, we'll build the phone lines, and you can run them." But a crack team that had kind of spun out of MIT—this company, Bolt, Baranek and Newman—latched onto this packet switching model and ran forward. And the core thing that they needed to build was what was called the Interface Message Processor, or IMP. This was ultimately the router that would sit in front of the host machine. Universities like MIT and Berkeley would have these mainframes. But to connect those machines together, there would need to be these nodes that would sit in front of them and be able to build this network. And so, BBN used a Honeywell minicomputer that was fridge-sized, cost about $80,000, and built the logic around packet switching and rolled this out. There were a lot of engineering heroics that went into getting the first machine ready. But then it was time. Anay Shah (00:31:47): Almost 55 years ago, a small group of grad students gathered at UCLA to wait for the machine to be rolled off the truck, champagne in hand, and were able to celebrate the arrival of the first IMP. The second one was delivered to Stanford weeks later. And the prophetic first message, as the story goes, was meant to be "login," right? You now have users that can log in, but after inputting the first two letters, it crashed. And so, the first message was simply "lo," "lo." Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:32:19): So close to "lol." And, of course, what is a network with two connections? Pretty limited. But then they rolled out UC Santa Barbara and the University of Utah, and then they were just rolling out new IMPs to the large universities, month over month. Anay Shah (00:32:34): And these became nodes—almost a new node every month. And then every new node that came on the network amplified the value. Because now it's not just bidirectional communication; it's multilateral communication. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:32:47): So, they were building all this logic to do the resilient routing, to do the discovery of devices, and everything that you needed to do that. And of course, the original pitch was, "Hey, we've funded as a government all these expensive computers at all these research universities. Let's drive utilization." Maybe one team has a special program for doing something; another team has a special program for doing something. Let's let the departments connect. Anay Shah (00:33:07): One unexpected application really bubbled to the top that the researchers discovered. Quick, asynchronous messages were often more valuable than logging into someone else's system to run the code. And in 1972, ARPA's Bob Kahn said, "Everyone really uses this thing for electronic mail." And the network's purpose had quietly shifted from sharing machines to connecting people in the form of email. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:33:36): It's wild how as soon as you have enough connectivity, it's always the killer app. The killer app is always people communicating at a distance. Anay Shah (00:33:45): That's right. People wanting to do what we are biologically programmed to do, which is connect with other humans. And as sophisticated as these machines were, it was the simple act of asynchronous communication that became the killer app. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:34:02): And more people wanted it. There were new ways to connect within your local network over these terminals, so then you could connect into the broader network. It was no longer just about wanting access to a terminal to access the machine on your campus; it was about wanting a terminal so you could email your friends at the other campus. Sounds like an early social network that we'll get to later. And so the expansion continued. By 1972, there were 29 nodes. By 1975, over 50. Anay Shah (00:34:27): And some of these connections weren't just from university to university. We were now leaping oceans. It was clumsy, but we were able to go over the Atlantic Ocean from a node in Virginia to the one in Cornwall, England. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:34:41): There was some story where they came back from some conference in England and someone had left their electric shaver behind. Anay Shah (00:34:47): It was the middle of the night, so in England it was 3 o'clock in the morning. But he knew that his colleague was a workaholic, so he sent off a message at 3 o'clock in the morning, England time, to see if this person was awake. And he was. He saw that he was logged on and he's like, "Hey, did I leave my electric razor there?" Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:35:01): "Can you get my razor, please?" And it all worked. It was phenomenal. So, by the early 1980s, other research networks started to pop up in the US and elsewhere. People were like, "Oh, this ARPANET thing is pretty cool. We're going to build our own." There was DECnet, there was an IBM Net, there were various nets that companies and other research groups started to stand up. They had a new challenge: "We want to talk to everyone on any of these networks, and how are we going to do that?" And these IMPs were not designed for that. They had presumed there was only one network they were trying to build out. And so Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, who were involved in ARPANET, figured out what they needed to build was a common language to figure out addressing: where to send a packet of mail. And then also, the control protocol for sending information, to make sure duplicate packets weren't sent. And so this became TCP/IP: TCP for the Transmission Control Protocol, and IP for the Internet Protocol. You can think of IP as solving the addressing problem. You might be familiar with your IP address, which then communicates through routers what you're looking for, and who you're trying to get the packet to. And then TCP is the reliable way that a packet gets acknowledged. "Hey, this little chunk of information has arrived." It's like certified mail. Anay Shah (00:36:16): Like signing for my package. I have an address, so the package knows where to go. And then I signed for it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:36:21): "And I don't need you to send me the package again, because I got it." And so this combination became the backbone for connecting all of these networks together, and ultimately the backbone for the next stage of not the ARPANET, but the Internet – a network of networks. In 1983, they took every ARPANET host and said they needed to move to TCP/IP. That switch, on January 1, 1983, became the framework for the modern-day internet: many networks, all speaking the same language, able to connect. Anay Shah (00:36:54): And that's where we have the advent of the .com, .edu, and .gov, because we now had standard protocols for multiple nets to communicate together. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:37:06): 20.3.1.72 doesn't have the same ring as pets.com. Anay Shah (00:37:11): Pets.com, an important one, but we're not quite there yet. No, but by the mid-1980s, as Ben mentioned, there were multiple nets now connected. And ARPANET itself was showing its age. By 1990, it became apparent that the ARPANET needed to be decommissioned. But the work it had done, the ideas of decentralized networking, packet switching, and open protocols had firmly taken root. Research institutions and large organizations had firmly established how to exchange messages. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:37:41): So they were able to send files back and forth, maybe send each other's research papers and data sets. But this was not a thing with a web browser yet. We needed a structure around documents. And so Tim Berners-Lee, a researcher at CERN in Switzerland, proposed the document structure that would become the application-layer infrastructure of the World Wide Web. Anay Shah (00:38:01): And so the network that started off as a Cold War research project in response to looking up at the sky and seeing the Russians launch Sputnik, had now become the public and commercial Internet – an open highway for data, and the foundation upon which we would build the modern data center economy. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:38:18): So we now have this expanding network, but the computing on this network was still this terminal-based interaction between a terminal and a mainframe that then connected to the network, or a terminal and a minicomputer which connected to the network. And I think it's worth saying a bit more about minicomputers, which were both what became that IMP device and also a primary source of connection. These were not something that you'd buy for your house. They still were the cost of maybe a car when they first came out, but they were much more accessible than a big IBM mainframe, a room-sized computer. And so the company, Digital Equipment Corporation, or DEC, launched the first minicomputers in the mid-60s. A lot of what innovated on the minicomputer was software like Unix, C programming, and sockets, and all these foundational innovations that would later echo through to today. But there was room for a computer that a normal person could buy. Anay Shah (00:39:11): On one fateful day, January 1975, the cover of Popular Electronics magazine showcased the Altair 8800, a machine you could buy at home for $439, or $1,500 souped up, to run your own code. And there were a few hobbyists that went to the newsstand and picked up this magazine. Two in particular saw the cover and decided to do something about it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:39:42): And so Bill Gates and Paul Allen, famously, when they were at Lakeside High School in Seattle, they had access to a computer and a terminal, and they would spend hours and hours programming. But that's different than having one in your own house that you can play with. And so when they saw this come out, it was immediately clear that this was a moment when computing had gotten cheap enough that a normal person could afford their own personal computer, or PC. Anay Shah (00:40:06): And you could see that if the first one was released at $450, it was only a matter of time before that would become accessible to more and more people. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:40:16): Microsoft formed immediately to sell a BASIC compiler for this device. The Apple II launched in 1977, which kicked off the PC wave for many folks, and it paired with VisiCalc in 1979. So, all of a sudden, you had a killer app – a spreadsheet – that wasn't just for home use, but now had a corporate function, driving the purchase of these PCs. And so someone could model a budget without needing to connect to the mainframe down the hall. Anay Shah (00:40:43): I can stay at my desk and run my finance operations. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:40:47): That's right. And IBM, while not the first here, was actually pretty quick to realize there was a problem for them. Right. If everyone is doing all the computation on their desk, they're not going to need the mainframe down the hall anymore. The glass house had been shattered. So they kicked off a skunkworks project. It was actually pretty amazing. They isolated it outside of the New York region, down in Boca Raton. They said this team would use off-the-shelf parts to design an IBM PC. In 1981, they built and launched the IBM PC, and they licensed MS-DOS from Microsoft, which had been founded six years earlier, as the core operating system. They thought hardware was the business, but time would show them to be incorrect. A bunch of IBM-compatible devices, including Compaq and others, flooded the market through the 80s. So prices fell. Hardware became a commodity, and Microsoft, with DOS and then Windows, became the Wintel duopoly that ultimately took the mindshare and market from IBM. Anay Shah (00:42:00): That's amazing. You got Lotus 1-2-3 dominating spreadsheets. You've got WordPerfect. I remember using that for word processing. And then Microsoft comes along and says, "I'm going to bundle all this into Office" and really took the cake. So productivity was through the roof, and we were able to do more personally than we could ever do before. And the way we collaborated? It was that magic floppy disk. We were able to hand that back and forth and keep on rolling. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:42:21): And that's great, right? Until it's not. Anay Shah (00:42:24): Until it's not. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:42:25): You want to work with someone across a big building? You're going to run them a floppy disk? And what if they have a different version? It's a mess. I think the "personal" in personal computing started to become a hindrance here. So we needed to connect these devices as well. Enter the invention of Ethernet and IBM's Token Ring, which wired the floors and connected these PCs into a corporate network. And a new set of companies emerged. Novell, building NetWare, actually turned a server into a hub for shared disks and printers. You had a PC on your desk, and if there was a printer room and you wanted to print, you'd have a different computer. That was a specialized PC that we'd call a server, connected to that printer or to shared storage. Now we were able to access files and print over a network. A whole company, Novell – which at some point was actually the second-largest software manufacturer after Microsoft – Anay Shah (00:43:23): Wow. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:43:23): was booming in this era. Microsoft, doing what they do very well, responded by building a network-connected operating system – eventually Windows NT and other services – so that you could do it all within Microsoft's ecosystem. Anay Shah (00:43:37): So throughout our conversations, a lot of the OGs in this industry pointed to this moment as the introduction of the client-server era. What does that mean? Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:43:46): It means an application was really split in two. You had your computer sitting there on your desk running as the client and accessing a central database or a server in the back room. A bunch of technologies came up to support this, from Unix servers to ERP systems to Windows NT. But now, all of a sudden, you would think about an application as networked from design, where you'd have local client software that could use the best capabilities of the local PC, connected to the server. Not across the world, but the server in the server room, on site. Anay Shah (00:44:20): What was that server down the hall or in the other room or across the world? Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:44:25): Most notably, this was the era when the architecture of the personal computer was adopted. This included the x86 (Intel-based) architecture or the Sun workstation architecture. Increasingly, those would become the servers that could run these applications. This was a notable shift, again, from the IBM mainframe era. It got to the point where someone selling your company an application would sell you an appliance, which was really a package of the software and the hardware together. So you ended up with a sprawl of different appliances that were being managed, all serving different functions, all written with their own bespoke software and operating systems. So, while the functionality was amazing, people became very inefficient. Anay Shah (00:45:10): Up until this point, there was a culture and an ethos among data processing professionals that put conservation as the highest ethical principle. To waste a CPU cycle or a byte of memory was embarrassing. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:45:23): I think part of it was that they had gotten cheap enough; these servers, which would have been $10,000 a month to rent just 10 or 15 years prior, had now gotten cheap enough. And it wasn't unreasonable to have them sitting there idle at the same time. In a macro sense, this inefficiency later created the space and value for the evolution of time-sharing into virtualization, where we asked, "Why can't we run these applications on one box? Why do they all need their own box sitting there waiting for a command?" Anay Shah (00:45:49): That's right. If a box was not being maximally utilized by a single client, share the box. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:45:56): We will do a whole episode on how that came to be. But this was still an era of deep innovation, particularly concerning redundancy. You had RAID arrays, which provided redundant storage, and backup tape libraries that were off-site, because you still had these massive points of failure. Your company server, which might be your system of record for your customers, was sitting there in the closet. I heard from someone who ran some of it at REI at one point that they had a flood near their headquarters, and they were like, "Well, the website's going to go down, we're going to lose all this business." So this model was not designed for scale and redundancy in a major way. So, to make this moment concrete – of just how computing power and connectivity was starting to shift – let's talk about a deeply innovative retail company that, no, is not Amazon. We're talking about the OGs of major retail and scale. It's Walmart. Anay Shah (00:46:50): That's right. So, you're at the register at your neighborhood Walmart location: you scan the toothpaste, the barcode beeps. Within seconds, a satellite dish behind the store sends that transaction to the sky and over to Bentonville, Arkansas, where they're hosting their mainframe computer to record the sale. A few minutes later, a massive data warehouse would update how many tubes of toothpaste you had just bought. Then, perhaps before the end of the day, Procter & Gamble's factory would receive an update that they needed to make more toothpaste. This was the cutting edge of retail in the late 80s, and Walmart made a massive decision to take this a step further, truly driving innovation across the retail industry. They invested $24 million to build their own private satellite network linking all Walmart stores to headquarters. This was fairly unprecedented at the time, right? Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:47:43): It was the largest private satellite network. Anay Shah (00:47:46): That had been built, and it created a unified, real-time machine. So any single event that happened within the Walmart ecosystem rode on this private network, enabling them to mine their data in a way that was unheard of before. By mining their sales data – which could now be collected in real time across all Walmart stores over their private satellite network – they discovered that when hurricanes approached, the sale of Pop-Tarts increased 7x over their normal rate. Having spent a summer working in Bentonville, Arkansas, I can tell you this is deep in their DNA. They are constantly looking at signals like this. Specifically, they discovered that it was the Strawberry Pop-Tart that was most in demand before a storm. This led to the legendary insight of meteorologists predicting a severe weather event, and Walmart stocking their affected stores with pallets of Strawberry Pop-Tarts. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:48:43): It makes me wonder if the reverse is possible. It's like, instead of checking the weather, you go to Walmart to see if the Strawberry Pop-Tarts are there, because it's such a reliable system. Like, I know that they're watching the weather, but I mean, there's some crazy innovation here. Both the satellite link, and then Walmart, supposedly, was the owner of the first commercial 1-terabyte enterprise data warehouse they built with a company called Teradata. They were just maniacal about making sure all the sales and customer data flowed into one place. By 2001, just nine years later, that one-terabyte warehouse had grown to 70 terabytes. Anay Shah (00:49:14): Wow. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:49:15): Right. So this was just an explosion of connectivity inside the enterprise, even while there was the personal computer. Some people had fun with their computers at home. I remember playing on an IBM XT as a kid, and some early programming and early games. It was not like most people had a real personal use case. We're still talking about a corporate-centered world. So we talked about the rise of PCs and the growing client-server LAN inside a company. We talked about these data centers; we talked about Walmart's satellite network. But what was happening now, going into the early 90s, with this whole ARPANET/NSFNET Internet thing? What was happening outside the office? Anay Shah (00:49:55): Yeah, and perhaps what was happening under the ground. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:49:58): So the first network that was available to all these researchers was the evolution of this into the NSFNET. It became the de facto US internet backbone. Anay Shah (00:50:07): This network was connecting 2,000 computers in 1986 and expanded to over 2 million by 1993. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:50:15): It was no longer just researchers who wanted to do stuff with it. So, the design and topology was a high-speed national backbone that had, at this point, gone to a T3 line (at 45 Mbps) that connected a small number of regional networks. So, kind of like a central hub-and-spoke model. These regional networks would then connect to universities, labs, and nonprofits. But this was not designed for commercial scale. Anay Shah (00:50:39): In fact, it was prohibited, according to their terms of use, to have commercial traffic running on that backbone. It was specifically designed for research, education, and government data. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:50:50): So, I think some private commercial network could happen inside just a regional hub, but not across that whole big backbone. So you did not have the beginnings of what could be a commercial internet. If two regional networks – say, New York and Philadelphia – wanted to connect, they had to flow back up to that NSFNET backbone. There was no neutral point where they could connect and exchange. So this was the moment when commercial ISPs and telcos started to see, "Okay, this internet thing is interesting, this packet-switched model." People wanted to do new things with this. Maybe it was trying to get out of the lab into commercial use. How were we going to connect? What were we going to do? Anay Shah (00:51:29): In 1992, a group of network providers were sitting in Virginia, drinking a beer, and decided to connect their networks outside of Tysons Corner. This specific group of engineers was from Metropolitan Fiber Systems, the local telco. They chose Tysons Corner outside of Washington D.C. because there was a dense network of defense contractors and early providers, which were heavy users of the current internet. They famously set up in a repurposed parking garage to become the de facto on-ramp for new ISPs. When you think about an important hub, you wouldn't typically think of a parking garage, but it was the right place at the right time. It turned into what was called Metropolitan Area Exchange East – East Coast. So MAE-East is what formed. And if you connected into MAE-East, that meant you had the internet at your doorstep. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:52:27): This became the hub for the internet. If someone sent an email from London to Paris, it most likely went through MAE-East. Anay Shah (00:52:35): Within a couple of years, roughly half the world's internet packets were flowing across the MAE-East parking garage. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:52:43): And I think this is something we'll see again and again, which is that the Internet forms around hubs. It's not always obvious why that became the hub specifically, other than it did first. And there's just this gravitational pull of connectivity. This wasn't new to the Internet; this was something that we saw with telcos. There's this concept called carrier hotels. You're in a city like New York, and you had two different carriers that were trying to connect with each other, right? Think Sprint and AT&T. Instead of having to connect all throughout the city in multiple spots, they would all show up in a neutral zone called a carrier hotel and build their connectivity infrastructure there. Anay Shah (00:53:21): You'd be able to tap into each other's long-haul routes, their local fiber routes, without having to build their own intercity footprints individually. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:53:31): And so May east was the first sort of flavor of this, where they would all come in and connect. Ultimately, a device — think a switch — that is connecting. Okay, you're coming in, plugging in your ISP traffic; here I'm plugging in mine. Now users across our ISPs can connect, and it's just one big switch room. The problem is, the Internet is scaling, and you don't necessarily want to all be bottlenecked on one switch. It's not the most secure thing. And if you're, I don't know, eventually building a video streaming service or you make a deal between two ISPs, you don't necessarily want everyone else to be in on that deal. And so you saw the evolution of this model to a different model that became known as MeetMe rooms. These are neutral physical rooms where an ISP or someone trying to hook into an ISP can provide their boxes and their connectivity, and then those two can connect directly. Anay Shah (00:54:20): So, a bring-your-own-box method. Instead of everyone connecting through the existing box, you BYO your box for the deal you want to do in the private MeetMe room. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:54:30): That's right. Something sounds funny about BYO to the private MeetMe room, but we're talking about ISPs connecting for data. Anay Shah (00:54:38): The farthest thing from a non-platonic conversation as you could be. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:54:44): And so, sure enough, this all worked. The NSF kind of officially sanctioned this method and designated these NAP points — Network Access Points. The first one, May east. They designated Sprint to run a NAP in New Jersey near the transatlantic cable landing points, one in Chicago, and one in San Francisco. Then they eventually added Mae west in San Jose. Anay Shah (00:55:06): And these MeetMe room models started to take off. The carrier hotels, you had One Wilshire, a large building on the west side of Los Angeles, which were law offices, and gave way to a single floor that could host hundreds of carrier routers and thousands of cross-connects, eventually making it one of the most valuable space per square foot on the entire West Coast. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:55:29): It's so funny. It's like this ugly building or just relatively nondescript architecture, and you're like, "What's going on in there?" Law offices make sense. And now this is where the West Coast Internet is coming through. Anay Shah (00:55:40): That's right. And we'll talk a little bit later about undersea cables, but they come in and want to find their shortest path to One Wilshire. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:55:48): And the business model was pretty genius for this. These telco hotels, these MeetMe rooms, ultimately provided power, cooling, and cross-connect, and they would charge rent. The dot-com boom to come would boost this model to new heights. Anay Shah (00:56:03): And it provided an elastic infrastructure that Internet companies in the dot-com boom and after could leverage, including, as we'll see soon, hyperscalers, where you could flexibly increase and decrease your capacity because they were specialized in providing all the necessary infrastructure to host the connectivity. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:56:25): So all of this infrastructure being set up to commercialize the Internet, to provide a scalable backbone, to enable the private market of ISPs and telcos and others to invest in making the Internet faster. And we now have the World Wide Web. The NSF has actually funded a little project called Mosaic, which is the first user-friendly web browser. We have personal computing. Enter the mid-90s and the dot-com boom. Anay Shah (00:56:53): Let's boom! Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:56:54): The ISPs are ready to build the network. All we need are the users. Anay Shah (00:57:00): And boy, are they coming! In May of 1995, Bill Gates writes the famous Internet tidal wave memo: "The Internet is the single most important development to come along since the IBM PC." And it was that same year that Netscape went public. Why was Netscape so significant, Ben? Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:57:21): I think it's significant for two reasons. One is it kicked off the accessibility of the Internet. It turned the Internet from this network for researchers to share files to this browser that you could download, install, and access the web, opening all of that up. And then it was that from a product perspective. But that also captured the economic perspective and interest: "Is there a thing here? Is there a new industry, a boom that you can make your millions or billions off of?" Its journey from founding to IPO in such a short cycle kicked off a mania. Anay Shah (00:57:56): It kicked off another mania in the business world, which was: having barely any revenue or profits, you could hit a multi-billion dollar valuation, which is what they did. And the web exploded. You had 23,000 websites in 1995 to over 10 million by the year 2000. Global users climbed to over 350 million. Nasdaq tripled in two years. If you put a dot-com at the end of your name, just kind of like you put 'AI' at the end of your name today, you could raise millions on an idea and a slide deck. And in 1999 alone, you had more than 400 Internet companies going public, pulling in $40 billion. What a liquid IPO market that we could only dream of! Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:58:40): Today Microsoft hits all-time highs in the stock market. The energy was manic, right? Founders in their 20s would become paper millionaires overnight. Engineers were hopping jobs for stock options. This is the rise of the Aeron chair, the foosball tables, and the new economy where the rules of things like revenue no longer apply to business. Anay Shah (00:58:59): But it wasn't just applications; it was infrastructure as well. Carriers spent half a trillion dollars on fiber and wireless. You had these colocation companies expanding at breakneck speed. This company called Exodus Communications was the world's largest web hosting provider at the time, providing server colocation. Its revenue went from 12 million in 1997 to 250 million two years later. It peaked at a $32 billion market cap three years after that. It was laying the infrastructure in the ground and building the applications above it in a period of unprecedented growth. Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:59:37): And so to launch a startup, you had to build a site, a service, and a database. You needed money way ahead of time to buy the servers to stick in the colo box. Anay Shah (00:59:48): Wait, so you're saying, in order for me to launch a web business, I had to buy hardware? Ben Shwab Eidelson (00:59:53): Exactly. You had to take most of your venture capital dollars and spend it on servers even before you knew if anyone wanted to go to your website to begin with. Anay Shah (01:00:02): So you couldn't test your idea out, you couldn't A/B test, you couldn't do a landing page that drew in a... Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:00:07): waitlist, couldn't do any of that. Anay Shah (01:00:09): Wow, what a different world! Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:00:11): So all these new servers are trying to run on the new backbones that are being laid to power this boom. The traffic still at this point met at only a handful of public exchange points. Networks are plugged into these shared boxes at places like May east that we just talked about. That can only scale for so long. Anay Shah (01:00:30): You'd start to hit choke points, and May east, one of the earliest network access points, became one of those major choke points. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:00:38): We needed different models for companies, ISPs, non-ISPs, to connect. You had DEC kicking off Palo Alto with the Palo Alto Internet Exchange, a non-telco neutral spot. Then you had the founding of Equinix where they took that model and scaled it with their first site in Ashburn, Virginia. Anay Shah (01:00:59): Ashburn is the Wall Street for data centers. In 1999, Equinix launches their first data center under this new model in Ashburn, Virginia, right next to May east, the choke point. But the original network access point isn't. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:01:13): This, near D.C.? I've never been there. Have you been to Loudoun? Anay Shah (01:01:16): I grew up right outside of D.C. on the other side of the river. Loudoun county is on the Virginia side. It's rural farmland. It's past Dulles Airport. There's really nothing there. But it's proximal to a large East Coast population, the undersea cables and May East. And you actually had AOL choose Loudoun county in the mid-90s to set up a huge dial-up campus. So they laid fresh fiber and drew even more carriers into the region. And May east had grown so large it outgrew the parking garage it was in. So the Exchange relocated to Ashburn. So you've got this unassuming farmland outside of Dulles Airport. And it was really catalyzed by a couple things. Outside of AOL pioneering the new site, it was policy-led. So Loudoun county ruled that data centers could be treated like ordinary office parks. They eliminated all these special use hearings and provided incredible tax breaks over time to attract data centers into this network. Coupled with that, Dominion Energy, seeing what was coming ahead, offered some of the lowest industrial rates to string high-voltage lines to this empty land to bring power and fiber together to create the new data center model which Equinix pioneered in Ashburn and became the largest Internet hub on planet Earth. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:02:42): So it's the combination of perhaps for a moment, cheap land (not so much anymore), fiber and connectivity, cheap and accessible power, and favorable policy. One interesting policy story that I heard on this: Apple was looking for where to put a new site in the late 2000s, 2009. Apple's obviously building more services, needing more storage, and building more data centers. So they run a process, and it turns out that North Carolina gives them a better deal. So Virginia fights back and in reaction passes major tax breaks to say that if you're building a data center, basically if you're building anything more than $150 million of investment, you're going to employ more than 50 people — no tax. Anay Shah (01:03:22): You, of course, are. If you're building a data center, of course. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:03:24): Of course. Yeah, you can't build a data center for $150 million. Anay Shah (01:03:27): Local policy, as you mentioned, is so important. Federal policy actually played a big role here. In 1996, we passed the Telecommunications Act. And one of the main things it did was force the incumbent telcos — which were regional monopolies from the AT&T breakup — to lease their physical network (their copper pairs, their fiber) to their competitors. So prior to this, a data center was a private enterprise tied to a single carrier because the carriers only used their own fiber. Now it enabled carrier-neutral sites. So you could become a tenant of a data center and choose from multiple fibers provided into that building. And it opened up an explosion of choice for tenants and for this carrier-neutral model. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:04:11): And so this is a flywheel of a deregulation environment to build this because once they have the tax incentives in, it becomes a major source of economic prosperity for the region. Now, we'll fast forward later on in the story to today, and maybe hitting some of the first real pushback. Anay Shah (01:04:27): And similar to Frankfurt, Amsterdam, London, Tokyo, the biggest hubs are where you can find cables and carriers and connect the most networks with the least amount of friction possible. And it's this flywheel that continues to make Ashburn the largest home of data centers in the U.S. And what a time! Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:04:47): In the first six months of 1995, Internet traffic was doubling every 100 days. The telcos were convinced that you couldn't overbuild. You just needed all the fiber you could put down. Anay Shah (01:04:56): WorldCom and these other telcos, they just poured billions into this. And the idea of overbuilding — not possible, particularly in this Internet boom, right? But by 2000, how much of that installed fiber was actually being used? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:05:11): It was only about 3% — 3% was lit up. So they just laid down fiber, the shards of glass that were just sitting there empty. Anay Shah (01:05:19): So to give you a sense of the amount of fiber miles laid during this period, you could go around the circumference of the Earth 5,000 times. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:05:27): Wow. So this was all over land, right? But how would you connect to Europe? Anay Shah (01:05:31): Ah, and that overbuild, you're right, was not just limited to land. Nearly all intercontinental Internet traffic rides on undersea cables, which I'd kind of heard of, but I didn't really have a full appreciation for the fact that bundles of glass threads are wound into a garden hose structure and laid down on the ocean floor all over the world. So imagine a planet stitched together with hair-thin strands of glass tucked into an armored hose and laid across the darkest parts of the ocean. That's the undersea cable system, and it's the real physical Internet that connects the continents. So 99% of international data still rides on these cables, not satellites. That's racing pulses of light through fibers thinner than the human hair. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:06:23): The story arguably starts way back in the 1850s, when we had the first telegraph cables crossing the Atlantic. They brought those across steamships and landed the first link in 1866, able to send news for the first time across the ocean. Anay Shah (01:06:38): So instead of weeks, you could get the news in minutes. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:06:41): Yeah, you're not sending the news via ship, you're sending it via electrons. Anay Shah (01:06:44): Amazing! Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:06:45): Fast forward to 1988, and we land the first transatlantic fiber-optic cable. It runs between the U.S., the U.K., and France, and it kicks off this new era of cross-continental capacity. By the late 90s, as this boom was happening, you can imagine the funding routes going into wiring all of this up. Anay Shah (01:07:07): You lay all this cable down with specialized cable ships that survey the seabed, unspool the cable, and then near shore they bury it underneath to protect it from anchors and storms, and then raise it up through some nondescript concrete box. This garden hose has optical repeaters that boost the light every 50-100 km, so you can sprint thousands of miles without fading. Then you get to land, and these concrete bunkers have the cable hop up into terrestrial fiber and then run straight to your One Wilshire or any of your nearby hubs that then connect you onward. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:07:44): What a wild thing. You have a garden hose-shaped thing moving all this data. What do we actually mean? Well, modern cable, as an example, one laid in 2018, can move 250 terabits per second. To conceptualize that, you can send 6,000 HD movies in one second, or about 20% of global internet traffic can go in one garden hose. How is this working? Well, at the beginning of using fiber optics, you would shine a laser down and blink your zeros and ones. But we've moved from doing that with one wavelength to doing what's called wavelength division multiplexing. That's a fancy way of saying we use the rainbow; we're using multiple. Usually, it's around 80 to 120 different colors that can go down the same cable at the same time. The other thing is we've added more fibers. So instead of there being a pair of fibers, we now have up to 12 to 16 pairs of fibers. And then the last thing is called coherent optics. This is a way of modulating the amplitude of the light. So instead of it just being on and off, you can actually have multiple steps. All of this adds up to today, probably 250-300 terabits maximum capacity in one hose. There are hundreds of hoses around the world. And I think the other thing that's really cool about this is the thing that was laid was the glass. We keep increasing the capacity of the glass because the glass is the glass—resilient infrastructure. It's kind of like railroads. It's like we're still using the tracks. Anay Shah (01:09:07): From long ago, even if the engine gets upgraded. And just like we've been talking about with this network effect, when you bring more networks in, it increases the value and the speed. And so that's a big reason why Ashburn, as we talked about, hardened. Once hundreds of carriers and thousands of cross-connects land into a single place, moving it is impossible. And so if you need to reach Europe fast from the East Coast, you're going to colocate where the undersea cable is already coming. You've got New York, New Jersey, Virginia, tying to Cornwall, England, and to Marseille. You've got the Red Sea and the Mediterranean corridor connecting into Djibouti as a critical touch point. You've got Miami as a key touch point into Latin America. Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan are key corridors into Asia Pacific. Mombasa and Lagos now light up Africa's East Coast. Hundreds of cables have converged that have connected the entire world. And this then forms the network of data centers that we have built and will continue to build through this story. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:10:16): And so the boom continues, right? Anay Shah (01:10:19): No, there was something like the bust to that boom. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:10:23): That's right. And by 2001, everything collapsed. Advertising folded, startups folded. Exodus, that we talked about earlier, filed for bankruptcy, had nearly $6 billion in debt. PSINet, one of the largest ISPs, had already collapsed. So, was this the death of the internet and the death of the value of all of this fiber that was laid? Clearly not. It was the death of a particular moment and an overbuild and a bubble. But in fact, the actual infrastructure that was built out would prove immensely valuable as services that mattered matured and business models matured. In other words, I'd say the application layer of this era died, but the infrastructure lived on and would eventually thrive. Anay Shah (01:11:03): So the dot-com tide went out. But the overbuilt assets were exactly what we needed for the next chapter. And it included infrastructure that we can't live without. The carrier hotels, the fiber, the data centers, the glass in the ocean didn't disappear. It just changed owners, and there was a fire sale, right? Assets were being sold at a fraction of the cost. A few key actors survived, and a few new ones stepped in. Equinix survived the crash. They doubled down on the real asset that they had, which was interconnection. That neutral meet-me room turned into a marketplace where competitors paid you to be neighbors because the value was in the speed, the reliability, and the flexibility that these carrier hotels provided. Meanwhile, private equity swoops in, as they will in every bust cycle, and reframes the category. So, one in particular buys a couple dozen distressed facilities around the world, turns it into a vehicle called Digital Realty Trust, takes it public as the first pure-play data center REIT, and treats compute space like real estate. These weren't high-tech moonshot assets they were buying. They're bringing patient capital in to standardize the shell, finance it cheaply, and get long leases, which becomes a blueprint for the next two decades of data center buildouts. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:12:30): In addition to the sobering economic environment of 2001 from the bust, there was also September 11. These financial institutions were still operating in this moment, having their key servers trading information connectivity with banks in their offices or right near their offices. So when 9/11 happened, the Verizon 140 West Street Central Office, one of the largest telecom hubs in the city, was blasted with debris, and dust flooded the equipment rooms. Tens of thousands of voice and data circuits were knocked offline immediately. Most of those circuits were powering exactly that: brokerages, market data providers, the trading floors, low-latency connectivity to the stock exchange and clearinghouses. So imagine the market is just disconnected now in a flash. And this cascaded. Engineers worked night and day to bring things back online. I was looking into Morgan Stanley's experience. They saw their whole trading system go down. They had a disaster recovery site in New Jersey, but they didn't have the same level of connectivity and data feeds. So it took them a few days. They ran new fiber through building basements, patched hubs into another telco hub that was still operating to restore capacity so they could trade when the stock exchange opened on September 17th. And I think coming out of this, there was a whole reshaping of the data center world to think about resiliency in a new way. I think it showed the physicality in the city of this connectivity right in this moment, where you could take for granted that you could take action on data over there, whether a trade or market data. Anay Shah (01:14:07): And it wasn't enough to have redundancy on another floor in the same neighborhood. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:14:12): Right. Anay Shah (01:14:12): We had to start thinking about an infrastructure build-out in different locations with different networks, facilities, and routes to really build true resilience and switch over to the point where now, if a data center goes down, there's automatic rerouting, and we don't see those same blips, although it happens from time to time. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:14:31): This early 2000s phase is a real maturing and growing up of the entire industry to realize that these servers and data centers are holding important financial data and need to be treated as such. But meanwhile, in consumer land, there's a glimmer of light, and it's a big one. This is the era that we move from that squeaky, squealy phone modem to broadband. Anay Shah (01:14:55): I remember touring for colleges, and some had Ethernet across the campus, and others didn't. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:15:01): I feel like getting broadband to our house was a radically different experience. It was like a different internet. Anay Shah (01:15:08): The image didn't load from top to bottom. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:15:10): Bottom, it would just fly through. And so this is when BitTorrent starts soaring. This is when Skype launches in 2003, and you can actually make VoIP calls. Anay Shah (01:15:18): Oh, Napster was possible. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:15:20): World of Warcraft launches in 2004. I remember that, taking the college campus by storm. Early web video products started to come out. Anay Shah (01:15:28): By 2005, you had a billion people online, about 16% of the planet. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:15:35): So all those folks prognosticating with excitement in the late '90s were not wrong. They were just off by five or six years. And so there's also the advent of CDNs. So Akamai's footprint exploded to provide more and more storage and replication and caching at the edge. Anay Shah (01:15:52): And so what exactly does this mean? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:15:55): It means at the places where your ISP is connecting, if someone's downloading an image—let's say you load the New York Times on your computer, and someone else does on their computer down the street—you don't both need to go all the way back to the New York Times home server for access to that photo. It's now been cached on a nearby CDN that's directly hooked up to your ISP. Anay Shah (01:16:13): So in the early to mid-2000s, you have the consumer coming back. Applications are flourishing. The internet is becoming a part of the fabric of society. And there are a handful of companies that survived the bust and captured this moment unlike any other. They not only built incredibly large consumer and enterprise businesses, but they actually became critical infrastructure companies that helped build the modern data center world. That is what we're seeing booming today. The place we're going to start with is the best place to buy books: Amazon.com. So whatever book you wanted to... Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:16:50): Find, from A to Z. In July 1995, Amazon launches. By '97, they IPO, and by '98, they are no longer just a bookstore. They're on their path to becoming the Everything Store. Now, it was not initially Bezos's and Amazon's intention to become the infrastructure provider of the world. But this high-growth moment of the late '90s set the stage for what they would need to build, not just for themselves, but for everybody. In those early days, they were running expensive, quote, unquote, reliable servers from the likes of DEC. Extremely expensive products—high-margin servers. Now, the problem is Amazon was not a high-margin business. They're trying to go for scale. They're selling things at whatever the cost was to pass through. They are a retailer trying to be the lowest-margin retailer out there. The cheapest way to get your book delivered to your doorstep. Anay Shah (01:17:45): So, running a retail business, they're always... Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:17:48): Tight on cash, so spending it on servers stopped making sense. So by 2000, they were spending so much on infrastructure they were worried this was going to bankrupt them. And so they kicked off a big project to rewrite all of Amazon.com onto Linux and to run it on much cheaper HP servers. Anay Shah (01:18:05): And this is when Amazon was famously a huge monolithic codebase. Every new category they launched, they had to work across their entire codebase. And it became this hairball. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:18:17): By, I think, around 2002, Bezos had had enough of that, and he issued the famous API mandate that internally every team had to expose functionality through hardened, documented service interfaces designed not just to be used by internal teams, but eventually potentially externalizable. Anay Shah (01:18:33): Classic Bezos. There are no exceptions. Every team must communicate through these interfaces. There were no backdoors, no direct threads, no direct linking. It didn't matter what that technology did. It would, without exception, be designed from the ground up to communicate externally to other teams. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:18:52): And if you didn't do this, what would happen? Anay Shah (01:18:54): If you didn't do this, you were canned. So, in this moment of reboot, it seems like the question that the company's leaders are asking themselves is: How are we able to scale our business like a software business and not like a furniture business? What if compute could scale with demand? And if we can do this for ourselves, why not rent it to the rest of the world? They were on the precipice of not just a technical breakthrough, but a business model breakthrough. Because for decades, running an online business meant these multi-year leases, these expensive servers, and over-provisioning to handle peak demand. And Amazon would go on to flip this on its head and fundamentally change internet businesses by saying you can rent a server by the hour and pay for only what you use. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:19:47): It is both deeply innovative at the time and also funny because we've had decades—a century—of doing this with our electricity bills in our own houses or water bills, right? This is utilities, utilities. You've always just paid for what you use. But what it continually enables is the driving down of cost and better utilization of centralized infrastructure. And Amazon had just lived through this painful period of having to rewrite their software and change their server architecture. And I think it was two things. One is: we never want to go through this again. A. B. No one should have to go through this again. And C, if we start to build the infrastructure for the world, that's going to accrue to our costs and our benefit. And there's going to be a flywheel here, just like any scale economies provider ever experiences. The bigger we get, the better. Anay Shah (01:20:39): That's right. And that utilization is such a key point. So, what happens in March of 2006? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:20:44): Amazon launches the first real AWS service: S3, or Simple Storage Service. Anay Shah (01:20:51): What does this Simple Storage Service do for me as a small internet business? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:20:56): It lets anyone put a blob of data on this non-physical disk and access it anywhere in the world. And that sounds simple in the name, but it was shockingly hard to put a blob—whether that was a megabyte, a gigabyte, or a terabyte of data—out there and have everyone around the world be able to access it quickly. Amazon abstracted everything away so that you could do that and just pay a monthly fee. You didn't have to build a server and plug in a hard disk and build another one that copied the data over and all these other things. It just gave you what you need as a developer. Anay Shah (01:21:32): So this enabled me to store information. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:21:35): Correct. Anay Shah (01:21:35): A few months later, what did they do? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:21:37): They launched the Elastic Compute Cloud, also known as EC2. Anay Shah (01:21:41): So I can store, and now you're telling me I can compute. How does this work? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:21:45): You can compute. And so what EC2 essentially was the ability to spin up computers—servers, as you saw fit. Now, what they were actually letting you spin up is what's called a virtual machine, where you can say, "I want to run Linux," or "I want to run Windows," or "I want to run some SQL Server OS," and I would have this virtual machine where I could deploy that, run it, and run whatever code I need to. And if I need a second machine, I push a button and get a second machine. If I need a third machine, a third machine. And I pay by the hour, by the machine, only for what I'm using. Anay Shah (01:22:16): This is outstanding. So I'm building a business, and I think I'm going to grow fast, but I don't know what traffic I'm going to get next month or in six months. And so I just raised a bunch of VC money. Now you're telling me I don't have to buy these expensive HP and Sun servers, and as I grow, I can just rent more compute and rent more space? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:22:37): Yeah, not just that, but I think the activation energy here was brought way down. Before there was the challenge of getting a server and getting space and all that. But in this model, now you just put down your corporate card, and you're off and running with the foundational building blocks that you need. Anay Shah (01:22:51): This is the Cambrian explosion for startups. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:22:53): Key to this is the utilization point. So many startups had bought servers that then never hit full utilization, or we talked about all these appliances sitting in the backroom closet not hitting full utilization. What enabled Amazon to drive utilization? It was the fact that, yes, they gave you a quote-unquote "server" to run your operating system on. They did not give you a server; in reality, they gave you a virtual machine. Not a machine, a virtual machine. Well, what is a virtual machine? A virtual machine is the flavor of the concept of a machine. And this goes back to a company, VMware, that was founded in 1998 by Diane Green and Mendel Rosenblum. Seid and I got to take operating systems in college from Mendel. And then Diane, as we get to later in the story, was running Google Cloud around the time I was leaving Google. So, legends in this field and in this industry. What VMware did is they made it possible to take a normal computer—whether it was a server or a PC, for that matter—and run virtual machines on that computer. And why that's typically hard is a computer is usually made to run one operating system at a time, and that operating system is managing applications and making sure that the computer doesn't crash. Well, if all of a sudden you have multiple machines running on a computer at a time and one does something that you can consider kind of unsafe—right?—that would stall out the machine or do something that they weren't supposed to do, that could break the whole model. But VMware's first product enabled an unchanged Windows and Linux to run side by side on the same x86 box. This accelerated to even more interesting use cases. So you can actually hot-swap VMs on machines at the same time. Let me give you a concrete example here. Let's say you're playing a game on a PC. It was as though all of a sudden, in the snap of a half-second, that game moved to another machine mid-frame. So this was actually designed to be able to hot-swap a virtual machine from one server to the next. Anay Shah (01:24:55): So it didn't matter that you didn't actually have your own server, because your virtual machine could float around as needed. So let's say that you have a hard drive crash. Well, you could have a snapshot running in the background and you could flip over to that one in real time. And so this notion of a virtual machine becomes the backbone for both the utilization point, because one physical server can be used to actually host multiple virtual machines, and a lot of the redundancy and fallback designs. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:25:24): And VMware wasn't the only one to do this. Eventually there was the open-source Xen project. That is what Amazon and AWS first used. This kind of thread becomes better and better over time as all the hyperscalers have figured out how to maximally virtualize everything that they do. Anay Shah (01:25:38): And so now, rather than me trying to run my pets.com and ensure that my product is getting to my customer and my website is doing everything... And then when it crashes, me having to stop everything, file the ticket, and pause business to fix the crash—that's just abstracted out to the specialists, to a business that is designed to solve this problem for me. And all I get then is continuous production, continuous service. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:26:08): And it gets cheaper for you every year. Anay Shah (01:26:10): It gets cheaper. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:26:11): The cost of S3 and EC2 has just gotten cheaper and cheaper and cheaper. It's an amazing business. And for many others, as we'll get into the story, building these data centers and the utility business is not their high-margin business. But for Amazon, this business has margins, which makes it a high-margin business compared to their retail business. Anay Shah (01:26:30): It's almost like if I were an airline spending all this time trying to figure out how to book a reservation, and then you gave me a program that could do it for me. I can now focus on serving the customer and serving more customers faster, and it explodes. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:26:45): Right. If you look at S3 in 2007, there were 10 billion items stored in S3. By 2009, that was about 64 billion. And by last year, 400 trillion items were stored in S3. Anay Shah (01:26:58): That's a really big number. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:27:00): It's a very big number. It's a lot of items. This powers the startup ecosystem and industry. Let's go back in time. So, what was driving the growth of all these numbers? Anay Shah (01:27:11): We're in Hackathon City. We're having happy hours with engineers and folks with ideas coming together. Now, if you have an idea, you can drop a credit card down, and you don't need to negotiate and buy hardware. No invoices, no contract, no sales calls. You're up and running within hours. AWS very brilliantly saw this as a pathway for short-term and long-term growth. In the short term, they can get a bunch of early-stage startups using their compute, and that's not going to amount to a lot of money. But some of them are going to grow, and they're going to be built on AWS. So they actually had a business model of giving out free credits at these happy hours, at these hackathons, to make AWS the default infrastructure platform to build a new company. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:28:03): I think it feeds through from that go-to-market to their product design. Their product design was deeply unopinionated about what you were going to do. It was to make it easy for you to get a server to go do what you want to do with it. Here's storage, as simple as it can be. These are the simplest Lego blocks you can build on. And so simple, in fact, that people then built what feels like the same business on top of them. Ever heard of Dropbox? Dropbox is just an S3 application for this whole early period. Anay Shah (01:28:31): It's storage. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:28:32): It's storage. Let's make it easy for syncing files from your computer to this new cloud thing, backing them up, syncing them, and sharing them with other people. Dropbox and S3 are intimately linked, and Dropbox is built to do exactly that. It wasn't until 2015 that they were like, "Okay, we should probably look at the cost of this." They eventually moved off of AWS to their own servers because all they are is the storage layer. So that's a rare case where it made sense. Anay Shah (01:28:59): That's all they are. They're still getting $11.99 a month for me. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:29:01): That's right. Good lock-in. The Dropbox AWS story is a classic one, but there's probably no better partnership to exemplify this time than the one that Netflix had with AWS. Anay Shah (01:29:14): Their ability to scale with these companies is really something to behold. In 2008, Netflix was still primarily a DVD-by-mail company. For those of us that remember, it had launched a streaming service as a side feature. The leadership knew that there was something here. But in August of 2008, Netflix suffered a major database corruption in its primary data center. For three days, it disrupted their DVD shipping and their streaming ability. It stopped their business. This was a huge wake-up call. The recovery was very painful for Netflix. They realized that their on-prem, vertically scaled systems were too fragile, and they couldn't recover quickly enough from major failures. The leadership decided they needed architecture that was designed to be more fault-tolerant, elastic, and globally available, because they had aspirations of being able to stream their future business all over the world. They concluded that they needed to focus on their core business. Building this out in-house was slow and costly. So Netflix actually became AWS's first marquee, all-in, public reference of a customer that scales. This proved to be vital. By 2015, Netflix was delivering billions of hours of content annually, almost entirely over AWS and their own CDN. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:30:33): They were running thousands of EC2 instances and had all of their videos, the canonical system of record, in S3 — like the actual videos that we are watching now. They did at some point realize that it was so important for them to own the latency and cost of that last mile of delivery—that edge. This is a perfect example of a use case for CDNs. They launched in 2012 what they call OpenConnect and the Open Connect appliances. This means that they would go into those "meet-me rooms" that we had talked about before and drop a Netflix peering box that would directly connect to your local ISP, and they would do this for free. Right? The ISP just says, "Hey, we have a lot of people trying to access Netflix. Let's make it better, faster, and cheaper." Anay Shah (01:31:17): It's a win-win. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:31:18): It's a win-win. They cut out the CDN that they were using at the time. Netflix saves money. Customers are happier. Everyone gets their videos faster. This way, when someone on the ISP accesses the newest popular movie, it's already close to them. Amazon doesn't actually even — they barely get hit in that moment. It's obviously running what's called the control plane for Netflix. Anay Shah (01:31:38): Yeah, because if I have to wait three or four seconds for that preview to load, I might not watch that show. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:31:43): You might churn. This is what powers streaming to this day. The same model is what enables others to enable streaming at scale. All of this — this whole Netflix case study — is the perfect flywheel and customer to show that AWS can scale with you, scale in a really challenging environment, be resilient, and power global reach. Netflix was not just a U.S. company at this point. Anay Shah (01:32:05): Yeah. For anyone that saw AWS and the cloud as a concept — as risky, unable to scale, or not enterprise-ready — Netflix helped debunk that for chief information officers around the world. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:32:22): They would just do whatever it took. I can't remember the exact story — I think this is from the Acquired episode — where Amazon would allow you to ask them to roll in a big truck, slurp up all your data into hard drives, then they'd bring it to their data center to plug in and dump all your data into your AWS instance. So, they figured out what was needed to close the enterprise customers. It's just amazing that someone known for selling books was able to so quickly build the brand around how to do this new, private, secure utility thing at scale. Anay Shah (01:32:54): So AWS continued to rethink what data centers are used for and how to build them out to serve the customer. Rather than having one mega-facility per market, they introduced the concept of Availability Zones, which became clusters of independent data centers within a region — each on separate power lines, each on separate fiber paths, linked with millisecond private connections. This Availability Zone concept and clustering was yet another piece of the data center evolution that AWS contributed to the ecosystem. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:33:29): I feel like this notion of U.S. East and U.S. West — this is how people think about their servers now — is this abstracted notion of an Availability Zone. Anay Shah (01:33:39): AWS continued to do this globally, and this actually became a blueprint for hyperscale. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:33:44): To end the Amazon story here for now, I think it would not be wrong to credit them with really kicking off the utility-scale cloud story, right? And getting so many things right: giving developers the simple building blocks they could use; going after cost, reliability, and redundancy; making sure to build the right guardrails for virtualization so that they could actually do this efficiently and build for the long term, using the same APIs internally so that it created a flywheel for them to move faster and bring those cost benefits back to the core business. It propelled them so far ahead in this business; they are still the leader to this day in the core cloud infrastructure product. Anay Shah (01:34:28): As a result, as we've been talking about, the data center is simple at its core, right? It's a facility with storage, compute, and connectivity. What AWS does is take the data center and enable it to build an economy on top of it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:34:46): To frame it another way, it used to be that if you wanted lights in your house — if you wanted electricity in your house to power those lights — you would put a dynamo to burn coal underneath your house, right? And if you wanted a website on the internet, you would buy a server and plug it into your home ISP. That is insane to us today. "What do you mean? You're going to power my house with electricity from underneath my house, right?" Instead, I'm going to hook up this shared infrastructure with all of my neighbors, and we're going to centralize our demand and build the cheapest, biggest infrastructure we can to generate the power. That's the same thing happening here for the first time. This is the introduction of the concept of the cloud, right? People have had the internet where they're interacting with publicly visible websites. Private enterprises have servers, but the idea that you have your own storage over there in a Dropbox folder, or you as a developer could build whatever you wanted and access this floating blob of data — that's to you — invisible where specifically it is, but it's out there. That was, I think, the conceptual notion of the cloud. I've come to somewhat dislike the phrase because it feeds into the invisibility of the infrastructure, right? It says, "It is nowhere. Your photos are nowhere, your storage is nowhere." Anay Shah (01:36:07): That's so far from the truth. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:36:09): It is somewhere. Anay Shah (01:36:10): It is in multiple locations. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:36:12): In fact, the cloud is almost the design antithesis of the glass room. The glass room where you want to show off, "This is where it is. This is where the compute is happening." Anay Shah (01:36:22): It is only happening here; it is happening right now. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:36:25): But it served a good purpose in explaining this notion of migrating to this unknown location, and has remained pretty sticky, I think. So, while Amazon was out there selling books, a little startup out of Stanford was helping you organize and access the information on the growing World Wide Web. Anay Shah (01:36:44): Google was founded in 1998, and shortly after, it was handling about 10,000 search queries per day. By the end of 2006, it was processing the same number of searches every second. Google acquired YouTube in 2006, a year after its founding, and at the time, it was already one of the fastest-growing websites in the world with 100 million video views per day. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:37:07): I remember folks having their first webmail-based accounts, like a Hotmail account. They'd have 2 to 4 megabytes. Well, Google notoriously on April 1, 2004, announced and launched Gmail as an invite-only service that had a full gigabyte of storage. Anay Shah (01:37:22): I remember you could get access if you referred in. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:37:25): If you referred in, or they started going on eBay for like $150, it was a hot ticket. By 2010, Gmail had over 150 million users. And of course, with more gigabytes of. Anay Shah (01:37:36): Storage available, it was amazing. It was from the very beginning the front door to the internet. But it was also going to need to be an infrastructure company. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:37:46): So, you go back to 1999, a year into Google's life, and an engineer named Urs is being shown around as part of his recruitment by Larry Page, the CEO and founder. Urs says you couldn't really set foot in the first Google cage because it was so tiny. The cage was 7ft by 4ft with 30 PCs arranged on the shelves, providing the world with more Google than it could handle. Our direct neighbor was eBay. A bit further away was a giant cage housing Deck machines and AltaVista. All of this was hosted at Exodus in Santa Clara, one of those colo locations that we talked about earlier. Anay Shah (01:38:21): So, Google was competing with AltaVista and all those others at the time. It was powering part of Stanford Search. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:38:28): That's right. Anay Shah (01:38:29): And running off of 30 PCs. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:38:32): Running off of 30 PCs in this colo center, it cost Google about $1,400 per month per Mbps of data. So they had to purchase 2 Mbps. At the time, 1 Mbps was about a million queries per day. From the beginning, Google looked at its servers and infrastructure differently. It was never interested in taking the tried-and-true path of buying the Sun or even HP boxes. Anay Shah (01:38:56): One of the most memorable stories of this time that explains this is the infamous corkboard. So, in the early days, Google engineers literally mounted motherboards on corkboard. They had $15 box fans pushing air across. They had zip ties holding it together. In a traditional IT philosophy, this is heresy. But the idea was that if a part doesn't add reliability at fleet scale, strip it away. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:39:24): This all set in motion an ethos of questioning the assumptions and, ultimately, deep, deep vertical integration of their infrastructure. Some might argue that that was Google's superpower, and still remains so to this day. Apple's piling all of that thinking into making the perfect iPhone; Google's doing it to their data centers. Anay Shah (01:39:43): So Google had a number of innovations that came from this early time. One was around how to do power backup. So, the standard was to spend for a facility-wide big battery. Well, by 2000, Google was questioning this model and seeing the waste in the large battery. So they actually put little batteries on each server. Again, they were accepting that one might go down, but that was okay as long as the whole fleet was reliable. The key to all of this working was moving reliability up the stack into the software layer. Google was not using off-the-shelf file systems and off-the-shelf software. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:40:22): They built everything here themselves. They assumed that hard drives would break, so they built the Google File System. This was around 2001-2002. So, this is a distributed file system that would take files, chunk them up, and spread them across three different servers no matter what. So you could always have resiliency. Also, this would make accessing a search index much faster. In 2003, they built Borg, a cluster manager, which ultimately was all about managing where jobs were running on which servers and machines. And it really was an extension of the virtualization and predates Kubernetes, which we'll talk about a little bit later. So, these were all the software components, but they were also questioning many of the physical constraints that people had looked at with servers. Most notably, they did some of the first experiments in "hot aisle, cold aisle" airflow containment. Traditionally, data centers were just a bunch of hot computers in a room, and they would blast cold air into the room. So you'd have to keep the room as cold as possible, often uncomfortably cold. There was no real thought about getting the hot air out of the room. Over time, it became accepted wisdom that you should point servers in one direction, get the hot air out of the room, and encourage that to happen. Google realized that the more you took that to an extreme, the better. So they would heat up and isolate the hot aisle from the cold aisle because then you could actually extract the hot air more efficiently and not mix it back into the cold. So, what we mean by cold aisle and hot aisle is that cold air needs to blow across those exposed chips and motherboards that would extract the heat off of the server into the hot aisle, and then the hot air from the hot aisle would need to be extracted out of the room. Google became a leader in designing the best airflow there. Anay Shah (01:42:05): This is a concept that continued for years. You also think about the traditional data center and this idea of assuming something's going to fail and building around that. Whereas in a colo facility, or when you're renting out these cages, every server had to work because it was a different company utilizing it. Not only that, 20 years ago you had specialty cleaning crews that were moving around the data center, and they would sweep up the room and then analyze the contaminants they had just swept up to understand how to continue to optimize the cleanliness and space around it. The idea of laying in a corkboard and a zip tie around it, and assuming something would fail, really takes the data center concept that existed then and completely flips it on its head and, as we'll see, drives better performance. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:42:59): All of this comes together when they build their own first scaled, homegrown data center. Anay Shah (01:43:05): I love this idea: Don't think of a data center the way we've been defining it, as a room packed with servers, power, and connectivity. Think of it as a warehouse-scale computer. Urs wanted us to think of it not as many machines, but as one machine. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:43:22): So, you think about the components of a computer, right? The storage, the memory, the compute. Urs saw what they were building out over time in their data centers and realized that they were just building a large computer that happened to be the shape of the warehouse. Anay Shah (01:43:38): Yeah. If you accept this premise, then you stop trying to make each server perfect, but you start thinking about making the fleet reliable, and you design entirely differently. So, this is about 2004. You have a wild man named Chris Sacca. So, before he was a famed investor, he was apparently a young, sloppily dressed individual walking around rural Oregon looking for "shovel-ready" enterprise zones where he could find some tax breaks. He was walking around asking for such astronomical quantities of power that, allegedly, a nearby town suspected him as a terrorist and called the Department of Homeland Security. But this was just what he was looking for. The Dalles, Oregon, had a site for him: 30 acres next to a decommissioned aluminum smelter that once drew enough power to power the needs of a small city. Sacca was ecstatic. He said it was visionary. This little town with no tax revenues had figured out that if you want to transform an economy from manufacturing to information, you've got to pull fiber. So Google went on to build out The Dalles, Oregon, and bring all of their innovation to bear to increase the performance of this data center. So, what that meant was low-cost, steady hydropower from the Columbia River; the Bonneville Corridor, providing high-voltage transmission; a cool, dry climate that lets you run a cooling process most of the year that's very economical; long-haul fiber that traces the river's edge; and a town that was hungry for a new tenant. This all came together to launch Google's first warehouse-scale computer to drive down unit economics, improve the performance of a data center, and therefore the unit economics of the entire fleet. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:45:35): And I would argue this is potentially the first built-from-the-ground-up, hyperscale data center. They're building to solve their problems, but their problems are at this point scaling so rapidly that they're thinking about how to optimize all these things, tuned with software, tuned with virtualization, and so this is the new blueprint for the future. That is still how we're generally designing data centers today. Anay Shah (01:46:01): They had a head start in thinking about infrastructure from the get-go, making it part of their DNA. It's not as if the other companies were standing still; they were building concurrently. This was a race, and they had to do it quietly. Google was the first to get operational in 2006. They quickly replicated this elsewhere in North Carolina and then in Finland, testing different climates to optimize. This included using seawater, hot aisle containment, and other ways to optimize cooling and performance. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:46:32): Yeah, there were other areas they kept pushing on, like the power supply system. Normally, each server you think about plugging into the wall converts AC to DC and then steps down DC for all the various components. Google instead realized that if they could just have a higher voltage DC current coming into the rack, they could then convert once cleanly and do it as late as possible. With that higher voltage, you'd have less loss, and you'd get efficiency gains across the whole path. So, at the scale Google was building servers, they could optimize every single part of the stack. Anay Shah (01:47:07): They later announced this 48-volt DC in 2016, publicly revealing double-digit efficiency gains that the world could then incorporate into data center design. Now, we've talked quite a bit about performance and efficiency, and there's good reason for that. Many data center companies were hemorrhaging money on power. The impact on the bottom line was significant enough that it needed focus. We had the distinct pleasure of talking to one of the OGs in data centers, Christian Belady. He told us this fantastic story of bringing the metric for power efficiency to the industry. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:47:55): It's called PUE, or Power Usage Effectiveness. This is a simple ratio of the total energy consumed by a data center, divided by the actual IT equipment you're trying to power. Right? So, it very easily spits out the overhead in running your data center. If it's two, that means twice as much energy is used for overhead than for the actual servers. And how did this metric come to be? Such a simple, beautiful metric. Anay Shah (01:48:21): Christian Belady was working at HP in the late 90s, and HP had a customer in Japan called NTT Docomo. Christian had been in the industry for so long that he had formulated enough standards through HP and the industry to come up with 10 best practices. He took these 10 best practices to Docomo, and they said, "Yes, this is great, we're going to implement all of this!" He replied, "Fantastic, come back in three months and we'll do a review." So he goes back to Japan, and they had printed out everything, with big stacks of paper on the desk. Everyone was in a suit and tie in a hot room when they told him, "Mr. Belady, we've done everything you said. Here are all of our reports, and nothing's changed. The servers are all still the same." Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:49:07): "It's even hotter in the hot aisle, and no one wants to go back there. So it doesn't seem like it's any better." Anay Shah (01:49:12): "That's right. We're still hot when we go in there. We don't think this is working. We're going to go back to the way we were doing it." Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:49:18): And it drives Christian nuts. The whole point was that you actually want the hot aisle to be hotter and the cool aisle to be cooler. That separation is what drives the efficiency. You don't want the air to mix. He knew in his bones, "No, you're running in a more efficient way. You have to see that." Anay Shah (01:49:35): NTT couldn't see the change or measure the efficiency gains of the hot aisle/cool aisle containment or the other recommendations that Christian was making. So he invented this incredibly elegant metric and kept it internal to HP. They continued to implement it in HP for six years until his good friend Chris Malone suggested he publish a paper and present it at Ken Brill's Uptime Institute in 2006. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:50:02): At the Uptime Institute, they presented the paper and kicked off a new organization called The Green Grid to publish PUE and other metrics. The team included Christian Belady, Paul Perez, Bruce Shaw, and Larry Vertel. These folks later became CTOs of Dell and led big teams at AMD. They thought it was just going to be an internal "here's the thing we tried" kind of paper. It hit the industry like a storm because the PUE race was now on, and Google wanted to win. Many enterprises had PUE numbers around 2, meaning twice as much power went to lights, cooling, and everything else compared to the amount of power that actually ran the IT hardware. Google pushed it down to 1.1, meaning only 10% of the power was not directly used to power the computers. Anay Shah (01:50:50): Their internal teams took hold of this and ran with it. They used this rethinking of the data center from the ground up as one computer system, with software being the reliability layer, not the hardware. This, along with innovative geographic placement, drove performance and PUE. It's come to a point where it essentially can't be optimized past one. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:51:16): Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, let's talk about what it is to go to one of these data center campuses. Anay Shah (01:51:23): You're driving up into vast open space where you suddenly see massive buildings growing out of the ground. From the sky, it maybe looks like a distribution center. You can see some steam flowing out from the building. But as you drive into this campus... Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:51:42): You start noticing: "Why would there be so much power infrastructure if this is just a warehouse?" Because you're seeing big battery packs, extra turbines, or generators. Anay Shah (01:51:52): The other thing you'll notice is that security is everywhere. You'll have to pass through a series of checkpoints as you get to the front desk. Maybe they're powering Netflix, but they're also powering Pentagon operations. They have an enterprise obligation, so security is paramount. So, once you're approved, you manage to get through multiple layers of gates. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:52:14): And then there's a moment—the moment of big reveal—when you walk in, and it finally hits you: the rows and rows and rows of machines that just go on further than... Anay Shah (01:52:24): The eye can see. These facilities are bigger than a football field, and they're lined with racks of blinking lights and machines. You're hearing this constant whir, and you're noticing the temperature. When you walk in, it might be fairly comfortable. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:52:42): I think 80 degrees is average in a Google data center today. What did it used to be like? Anay Shah (01:52:47): You had to keep these machines cool, and the best way to do that was to chill the room. So it was frigid; the entire room was blasting with AC. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:52:57): Back in the 80s, you'd just wear a thick sweater all the time. Now they can comfortably hover around 80. That's because of the really good containment they did of hot and cold aisles. Now you've taken in the machines, adjusted to the noise, and they've given you earplugs to get comfortable. You look up and start to see the infrastructure coming in, powering these servers and connecting them. Google famously had bright-colored wires and marked where the plumbing was. But it wasn't always like this. If you go back to the 80s, I think it was quite different. Anay Shah (01:53:27): You're now building right on the floor. But one of the ways to cool the data center decades ago was to raise the platform. So you'd actually look down and see that you're walking on panels above a hidden space where cold air was being pushed through. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:53:41): Per the trend of everything we've talked about, with Google driving the evolution, the question was: "What is the cheapest way to most efficiently do the thing we're doing?" And it stopped being those raised floors over time. Hopefully, that gives you a little taste of what it's like to walk into one of these. There is a nice Google podcast called 'Where the Internet Lives' that really gives a nice tour of exactly this. Anay Shah (01:54:00): It's a Google and Latitude Media production where you can actually hear the sounds as they record inside the data center. So the whir is very palpable. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:54:12): Google's investments continue to grow. They continue to vertically integrate, deeper and deeper. They go to their own sites, start buying up their own fiber. They took advantage of some of that dark fiber that we mentioned earlier, snapping a lot of it up. All of this is a capacity strategy. Ultimately, they want to have the capacity redundancy to drive their own cost down. While, mind you, they're building the highest-margin, best business in the world in the form of search and ads. So that whole flywheel allowed them to continue to invest in this infrastructure. Google had explosive demand, as they were the web company here. They had explosive internal use driving the value of the vertical integration. But the whole industry saw what was going on with AWS after its launch. And Google was one of many companies that realized they had some assets to put toward that, too. So they put together a team that launched App Engine in 2008. It let you run apps on Google's infrastructure, but was very opinionated about the app. It only supported Python with a particular framework. So it was quite different than Amazon's basic building block EC2 approach. It wasn't until 2013 that Google launched a general-purpose virtual machine capability. As a result of this approach, as well as Google's lack of enterprise sales and marketing motion, it took quite a while for their cloud program to get running. Things started to shift in 2014-2015. Google went public about its containerization strategy. If you recall our discussion of virtualization: you don't actually need to package up the whole operating system. You don't really care that it's running Windows or Linux. You actually generally just want to run the application. Containers are really a way to do that at the application level. This continued even further more recently with the idea of serverless functions. Anay Shah (01:55:59): So Google in 2014-2015 took the world by storm by open-sourcing Kubernetes and the Google Kubernetes Engine. It very quickly became the default way for programmers to use containers and migrate away from virtual machines. Now, they still didn't have an enterprise sales and partnerships muscle. But Ben, you were there at this time, right? Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:56:18): That's right. That's when they brought in Diane Greene, who we previously talked about as the founder of VMware, to help build that muscle. By 2018, their cloud share was 7%, AWS was 34%, and Azure was 15%. So they were a distant third. Following through to 2019, a new leader came in who has been the leader since, and he has made big pushes, growing massively. Their cloud business is now a $13 billion business, growing 32% net-net. You look at Google's story, and it's interesting. They've always been technically ahead, especially internally. They've always had amazing dogfooders—meaning people inside using their infrastructure. The problem was they did not know how to sell to this customer. They were not really a developer platform, especially to the enterprise. This is a market Amazon had cracked, so they really had to learn new skills despite having the best tech in the entire ecosystem. The other story is that Google's vertical integration sometimes went too far. They figured out the best way to do this for themselves, but sometimes that led to blind spots in what someone not in the Google ecosystem might need. So, the idea that every developer was going to build a new Python framework that Google released was a little self-serving when it turned out engineers might just want maximum flexibility, which Amazon deeply understood. Anay Shah (01:57:33): And it all starts with giving the industry an entirely new way of thinking about it: Treat the data center as a single, evolving machine. Build the hardware to suit the software that will survive its own failures. Put the buildings in thermodynamically optimal and grid-optimal locations, and publish your math. Showcase your performance and your PUE so that everyone can have FOMO and try to play catch-up. So, Google was spending billions on land, buildings, and hardware, designing its own infrastructure and overturning the data center world by building software to bind it all. Which forced the entire industry to meet hyperscalers like Google on its own terms. Competition was heating up. It wasn't just Amazon and Google. There were even more household names quietly transforming themselves. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:58:28): By the mid-2000s, Microsoft was unquestionably the software king. Windows was powering 90% of desktops. Office was licensed to print money. But things were changing. Broadband penetration was climbing. We started to see the emergence of connected phones—BBM and BlackBerrys and things like that at the time. And internet-native companies. They saw Google and Amazon building, climbing, and proving that you didn't need to buy software on a CD to run interesting computing applications. Remember, the cloud, as we've been talking about, isn't just about backend developers. Applications themselves were starting to move—not just their backend, but the front end to the browser as well. Anay Shah (01:59:10): Right, on the browser. You remember, Salesforce was leading the charge here. They launched with this idea of "no software, all in the browser." By 2005, they were doing nearly $200... Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:59:20): Million in revenue and capturing the mindshare, proving that this could be the future—not just of consumer applications, but also a business product like a CRM. Anay Shah (01:59:31): CRM enterprise B2B software. Ben Shwab Eidelson (01:59:34): So you're there, sitting at Microsoft. That is your greatest fear: that you're not going to be part of the application and operating system of the future. That is your whole business. At this point, it's not like Microsoft didn't run any web services. Ten years prior, Gates had sent his memo of the "Internet Tidal Wave." They had invested; they bought and scaled Hotmail; they had MSN; they had Xbox Live. But these were all self-contained services. They hadn't yet thought about how to expose an infrastructure to others to build on. They loved building operating systems that would ultimately run on others' infrastructure. They had built one of the best businesses in history doing this. They would write this code once, print as many CDs as they could, and it was this amazing, high-margin business. They didn't have to go buy other people's hardware. Anay Shah (02:00:16): They'd print the CDs, they'd print the money. This idea of infrastructure as a service was radical. Inside Redmond, Washington, the pivot for Microsoft was framed as nothing less than existential. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:00:28): As is often the case in a company motion like this, it's about people and talent. So they bought a company, Groove Networks, that brought in the famous Ray Ozzie, who had previously led the development of Lotus Notes. They brought him into Microsoft and made him co-CTO of the company. This was so existentially important. Think about what Meta's doing today to staff up talent. It was *that* important at the time. The cloud was the existential thing. "We need the leader of the cloud, Ray Ozzie, to come in and lead the way through this charge." Anay Shah (02:00:58): "If we're going to bet everything we've built on this pivot, we're going to bring in the best talent." Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:01:03): So they bought the company, put them in charge, and this was a 5,000-word manifesto about what the future of Microsoft needed to be. It's worth reading the whole thing, and we'll link to it in the show notes. But Anay, would you read that key section that really stood out? Anay Shah (02:01:17): In Ray's memo, he says: "'Computing and communications technologies have dramatically and progressively improved to enable the viability of a services-based model. The ubiquity of broadband and wireless networking has changed the nature of how people interact, and they're increasingly drawn towards the simplicity of services and service-enabled software that just works.'" Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:01:40): He ends that section by saying: "'Businesses are increasingly considering what services-based economics of scale might do to help them reduce infrastructure costs, or deploy solutions as needed and on a subscription basis.'" Anay Shah (02:01:54): "'—just give people the end result that they want and demystify everything that's happening.'" Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:02:00): That's right. And he ends with: "We must respond quickly and decisively." For a company of Microsoft's scale and history, that was really trying to be a... Anay Shah (02:02:09): Wake-up call. And didn't Gates and Ballmer kind of give Ray Ozzie a blank slate, like, "You're the leader here. Help us understand where the future is"? Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:02:17): Not just that, they let him carve out and run this separate from the Microsoft Server and Tools business, which had built Windows Server and SQL Server—which would have been the obvious place to try these things. But they knew that this was bigger than an evolution from what they were doing in their previous software business. This was a transformation: a fundamentally different product, a different business model, and a different go-to-market motion. So when everything had to change like that, it was very hard for the leader of the incumbent thing to keep going. Let's make this concrete. What does this mean for a server or a data center? Microsoft had Windows Server and SQL Server. When we talked about those server rooms that a company would run, they would very often be running Microsoft software. This was the IT sale they had perfected by this point. You would sell the Windows Server license, it would be Active Directory, it would be running Exchange and Outlook for your email, and it would be running your calendar and all these things inside your company's network. It'd be running Windows on their PCs. Anay Shah (02:03:15): So it's this beautifully connected thing. And this is saying, "No, no, no, we've got to move that server from your bottom line CapEx as a company into OpEx in our data centers." This is a transformational move from what you're providing at the end of the day—from just software that's going to run on someone else's computer—to actual services. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:03:32): Ray Ozzie goes for it. He staffs up a team they call Project Red Dog. They bring in Dave Cutler, who had previously led Windows NT and is a legendary programmer, to help lead the architecture of this new project. Anay Shah (02:03:46): So they're putting together this cloud strategy that is revamping Microsoft internally, and at the same time, ramping up direct competition to the front door of the Internet: Google. They evolved an old MSN Search product into what then became Live Search and eventually Bing, as we know it, in 2009. This was a moment that kind of rippled across the industry, especially for Google's dominance. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:04:12): I was at Microsoft at this time. Anay Shah (02:04:13): Oh, yeah. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:04:14): I joined Microsoft out of college in 2008 and was there in this moment: they had Windows Live Search. They briefly called it Live Search, then came this big rebrand to Bing. Microsoft was willing to spend a lot on this repositioning, on this marketing—so much so that they gave Yahoo a very sweet deal to power Yahoo's search and ads and gain some infrastructure market share. Anay Shah (02:04:35): This catapulted them into getting up to 20% share, which is no small feat in an exploding market that Google has been dominating. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:04:45): It's important to remember that doing search well and search ads well is a really hard scale problem that essentially only one other company had cracked, and that was Google. To respond quickly with an active, updated index of the internet, and to do this auction for the right ad unit—all of these things that you have to build—is what propelled Google to build their vertically integrated servers. And Microsoft was now putting themselves in the position of having to solve those same really hard technical problems, in addition. Anay Shah (02:05:12): To those really hard technical problems, we saw with Google that in order to effectively run this search business, you have to have a lot of compute power behind you. You now have to get into the data center business and build out infrastructure that is your own to drive down the cost and drive up performance. We mentioned Christian Bellady previously. He was at HP in 2007, gets a recruiting call from Microsoft, and his initial reaction is, "What the hell's a mechanical engineer going to do at Microsoft?" Because Microsoft is known as the software company, and so he turns them down a couple times. After the third call, he decides to go up for an interview, enjoys the process, gets an offer, but doesn't think much of it. And I believe he's at his parents' house when he suddenly gets an email from Bill G. (Bill@microsoft.com) explaining why he should accept the job offer. And Bill essentially says, "Everything's going to the cloud. We're investing for the cloud business, and we need to build out this new infrastructure as core to the future of Microsoft." Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:06:24): This seems like a wacky idea to go there, but Bill G emailing me? Like, you're there with your parents, and you've got to give this a go. Let's pack our things, move to the Seattle area, and join Microsoft. And so at this point, he starts there, and Microsoft had just finished building their first real, more integrated data center build-out. This is in Quincy, Washington, in Eastern Washington, a 13-megawatt build. And he walks in there, and everyone's looking around, and the first thought they have is, "We're going to get fired because there's no way we're going to fill this thing with servers." There's just no way that we have the demand. Anay Shah (02:07:00): And this was their first massive-scale, purpose-built cloud data center campus. This was Microsoft entering the infrastructure business. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:07:11): And similar to what we saw with Google at The Dalles, a lot of the same things that attracted them to Quincy were power from the same Columbia River. They're getting cheap 1.9-cent per kilowatt-hour power at the time to power this. And the climate was that dry, cool climate that allowed them to be really economical with using outside air cooling for much of the year. They had multiple fiber routes. It's in Washington, so they could connect their Redmond headquarters directly to Quincy. Anay Shah (02:07:34): The environment, the fiber, the power—it all comes together. And they, like Google, knew they had to work with the local community and the local government. And so they actually worked with the City of Quincy to build a Quincy water reuse system to treat and recirculate the cooling water to reduce the dependence on the local community. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:07:53): They built Quincy. They have it up and running. He's worried they're not going to fill it, but they kept going. Azure ends up launching in 2008, which we'll talk about in a moment. But I think it's very easy for a big company that's bet a lot of resources building something internally to think that they have an idea of what demand is going to look like. But they overbuilt in Chicago. Then they had it mothballed, they tried to sell it, and then nine months later, they were so happy. They didn't sell it because they needed the space. Anay Shah (02:08:16): It was hilarious. They tried to sell it to the government. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:08:18): So, what's going on there, and what's happening, is they're launching this project, 'Red Dog,' which would become known as Microsoft Azure. And it's hard to predict the scale of the utilization of infrastructure as you launch it. So let's go back to October 2008—the big reveal. This is Microsoft's big annual Professional Developers Conference, and Microsoft unveils not Microsoft Azure at the time, but Windows Azure. Anay Shah (02:08:46): And this wasn't just Windows running somewhere else. It's a platform for developers to build and host applications on Microsoft infrastructure, paying only for what they used. Rent some storage and compute, pay for what you use. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:09:00): And the key thing that you mentioned is, it was designed for those Windows developers. So it used all the familiar tools: the .NET Framework and Visual Studio and all these things. And it made it easy for you to take your work that you'd done over there that would run on Windows Server right inside of your office, and take that same code and shift it to run on Microsoft servers. What a powerful integration and move! It kind of split the thread between AWS, which gave these really basic building blocks—S3 and EC2—of this unopinionated 'run your own operating system, bring your own full thing, and we'll just make it work' approach. Anay Shah (02:09:35): Right. They were agnostic to what you were doing on top of it and how you were doing it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:09:37): Exactly. To Google App Engine, which was overly specific and cute about it, in a way Microsoft was almost more Google's approach, but it was the same code and the same thing that a developer had already used. And so they had this massive developer ecosystem and integrators, and this whole kind of motion around it. Anay Shah (02:09:54): It wasn't just easy for the developer community; this is Microsoft that has an enterprise sales engine. They've got a go-to-market motion. They have the finance department that knows how the sales team is going to operate and how to budget for it. And so they're bringing this world-class distribution and, most importantly, the trust from this massive customer base to bear with Azure. And the adoption is extremely rapid because people are already embedded in the ecosystem, and here you are coming with an improved product, and the enterprise base adopts it very seamlessly. Yeah. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:10:28): And it's not the story that Amazon has to make for the first time, which is, "Hey, come build your thing with us in the cloud," and introduce this. This is four or five years later, and it's sitting there like, "How do we think about the cloud?" We don't have an agreement with Amazon; that's not an existing vendor relationship. Whereas with Microsoft, you're like, "This is the agreement we have, this is the IT relationship we have, this is the full trust." If you're telling us this is how we can move to the cloud in a seamless, secure, safe way that's going to integrate with Active Directory and Outlook, and I just don't have to run the machines in my closet anymore? Sign me up. Ironically, I think some of the people they had the hardest time signing up were the engineers and product managers in Redmond, Washington. We were actually talking with Ben Gilbert of Acquired about this, and he at the time (this was 2012, 2013) was working on the web version of Microsoft Word. So Microsoft is finally going to compete head-to-head with Google Docs on product and ship a version of Word that you can use via your browser. And of course, the desire was for everyone to use Azure. Did they? Absolutely not. They said, "No. This is the custom server we need. We need this. Many of them can scale this big, and we had to do some custom JavaScript rendering, all this stuff." We want our own servers, probably still in Quincy, but we're not using the Azure APIs and layers. Anay Shah (02:11:43): So the own employees are demanding all this heterogeneity, resulting in a wide variety of server SKUs. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:11:52): Amazon, for context, building out AWS, I think had something like 20 different types of machines that were running AWS. Google, in their whole build-out, standardized on this vertically integrated, commodity-built server design. And so they would just keep it down to a handful of machine types. So supposedly at Microsoft, there were dozens and dozens of different SKUs that Microsoft was maintaining. So instead of calling this a server farm, someone called it a server zoo. You just think about where they're coming from in the evolution of all these different web services and different teams building their own thing. It's a whole different world. And around this time, I think energy starts to become an interesting layer as well. Anay Shah (02:12:31): So similar to Christian getting recruited in 2007, thinking, 'What the hell am I going to do at Microsoft?' he then goes out to recruit an energy expert. Brian Janes. In 2011, Microsoft saw the need for an energy person to be in-house. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:12:47): I'd say Microsoft saw the need, but I think Brian was confused. Anay Shah (02:12:51): Brian was like, 'I do energy, you don't need an energy person.' And his thought was, 'This is a dead-end job.' Being an energy person at a software company doesn't make sense because what they're trying to do is all about land, it's all about fiber. Energy's a distant third or lower down the list in the priority of how you think about scaling this type of infrastructure. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:13:10): Yeah, I think at this time, for context, utilities were happy you'd show up with your 10 Quincy, 13-megawatt data center, and utilities are like, 'Sure, great, sign up!' Anay Shah (02:13:20): Yeah, generally power demand is relatively flat. There's excess power available, and they're happy to sign you up and increase their profits because it's not going to drive any new infrastructure needs on their end yet. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:13:34): And how things change! This is 2011, 2012. Fast forward a little more than a decade to where we are now, and we'll get there. Anay Shah (02:13:43): But Brian took the job and ended up building a phenomenal team. And within a few years, his team was actually the decision-maker of where they were going to build out Microsoft infrastructure. And so it's a lead-in to us actually starting to care about where our energy is coming from and the whole complexity around where you're sourcing and doing these clean energy build-outs that Brian's team was leading. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:14:03): The team thought it was a real kind of planning challenge, right? And so they're bringing this up to leadership around, 'Hey, we need a lot of money to invest now to build this out.' Anay Shah (02:14:12): They're doing their annual budgets, they're projecting years in advance, they're getting into their mid-year review. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:14:19): Microsoft's in this weird transitional phase. They have Bing that they're still growing; they have other services. Xbox is booming, Azure is still early innings. So it's not the dominant use of their internal server build-out, but it's a lot of different teams to juggle and predict. And so this forecasting challenge is a real one. You bring this to leadership, and what are you there to say? Anay Shah (02:14:38): And you've talked to all the business groups to figure out what they're thinking, and you go to Ballmer with your prepared notes, and within a few sentences you get interrupted, and Steve Ballmer's like, 'Ah, the business groups don't know what they need. Let me tell you how to do this.'" Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:14:52): And he says, "Give me the Excel sheet. You just draw a straight line from how growth has been going the last few years, and you just project it out, and you just build the data centers that that line shows you to do." Anay Shah (02:15:04): Just a straight line from here to 2020. The business groups, they don't know what the plan is. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:15:08): There's actually a lot of wisdom to what Ballmer's saying because you realize that every team is trying to be excited about what they're building and Azure is going to have all this demand, but no one really knows—especially more than 12, maybe 18 months out. So how can you plan if you're building long-term, multi-year build-outs for what anyone's going to need? Anay Shah (02:15:28): This moment of growth? It was quite difficult. And Janes' team found that he was consistently under-forecasting. But he did go back many, many years later, and he was kind of curious: how accurate were his forecasts compared to the straight line in 2020? Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:15:43): He looked back, and Ballmer was off by how much? Anay Shah (02:15:46): 5%. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:15:47): 5%. So they should have just followed the line. So sure enough, Microsoft keeps at it, and the power team at Microsoft—the data center team at Microsoft—becomes one of the biggest builders in this industry. They shift from leasing square footages to megawatt-based deals, as they become a major, major hyperscaler. Anay Shah (02:16:08): There's a big learning journey for them, right, because they were a software company, and they had to grow very quickly into an infrastructure company. It was not an easy pivot to make, and they had to do that globally. The Microsoft team had the blessing of this entrenched enterprise customer base that was very loyal, very profitable, and very global. And so their go-to-market strategy was actually to follow their customers. And that meant that within a few years of launching Azure, they were getting calls from customers in Frankfurt, in Amsterdam, in Singapore. If their German multinational had data sovereignty questions, Microsoft would go and stand up capacity in the region. And so by 2015, they had announced over 20 regions, which was actually more than Amazon at this time. Each anchored on an interconnection-rich metro and typically supported by entering with colocation facilities—perhaps the Digital Realties of the world—before moving on to dedicated Microsoft campuses once they built up enough critical demand. But this go-to-market strategy forced them to innovate and expand all over the globe, and it drove massive results quite quickly. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:17:33): And to that point, you fast forward to today, and Microsoft's business is in significant part the Azure business. Azure is a core growth driver. It's now 75 billion of revenue a year and growing 40% year-over-year. And so this company that was 'the software company' ('we write software, we sell software, those are our core platforms, those are our products, that's what we do') is no longer just a software company; they are, in large part, a data center company. So we've gone through AWS, Google and GCP, Microsoft and Azure. But there was another company that many thought for many, many years was just a toy. Let's talk about Facebook. Anay Shah (02:18:16): The Facebook, the Facebook. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:18:19): In February 2004, Facebook's running out of a single server in Zuckerberg's dorm room at Harvard University. Early days caused crashes. In fact, many of his earlier products, including FaceMash, the 'hot or not' for Harvard campus, melted down the servers in the Kirkland House, and the IT department at Harvard was not pleased. But then it becomes a real company, right? Anay Shah (02:18:40): And they start expanding to other campuses, and you've got different schools putting on different servers in different data centers. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:18:49): In a way that I think creates automatic resiliency because if the server crashed for, whatever, Penn, it's not going to bring down Harvard. Anay Shah (02:18:56): And this isn't their concern, right? They're building this viral, game-changing platform that is exploding, probably beyond their expectations. And new campuses are signing up. So they're not really concerned about the infrastructure, but it's just growing organically. By the time they launch News Feed, you've got hundreds of millions of people refreshing this site, uploading photos by the billions, opening up Messenger just as a reflex of the thumb. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:19:23): And the company's spending all this money; they raised VC dollars and they're not happy spending all this money on fancy servers and colo cages. Anay Shah (02:19:29): And so they're realizing, 'Why is everyone making so much money on us?' There's got to be a better way to do this. And there are two broad ways that they go about this. One is similar to what we've seen with Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, which is the thought that, 'Hey, we can do this better, cheaper if we build our own custom data center.' And so their first purpose-built facility was announced on January 10th and began operations in 2011 in Prineville, Oregon. And they soon followed with North Carolina, Sweden, and Iowa, and expanded rapidly. But Prineville was, just like all the others, quite intentional and quite strategic. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:20:09): Yeah. And so similarly, in this kind of Northwest region, you had cheap power, you had a dry, cool climate, and you had Oregon's incentives starting to come into play where they offered long property tax abatements on any improvements they made. All of this combined to make a great site for their first 'Lighthouse' data center. And if you look at the numbers of server growth, if you go back just to 2008, they had 10,000 servers; in 2009, 30,000 servers. Supposedly by 2010, when they are really kicking off and building the Prineville project, they have around 60,000 servers. They're trying to figure out how to scale up. Anay Shah (02:20:42): And so they decide to engineer the building and the servers together. This very purpose-built facility. And just like the others, they realized that they can beat industry standards. And so they very famously and publicly came out with this first purpose-built facility with a very aggressive target of a 1.15 PUE. Industry average is 1.5. Historically, they were north of 2, and they were able to report 38% less energy, 25% lower cost against prior facilities. And do you think they ended up beating their PUE? Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:21:15): No way. Anay Shah (02:21:16): Smoked it: 1.07. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:21:20): So that means that only 7% of the energy going to run the data center went to anything other than powering the IT equipment. That is phenomenal. Anay Shah (02:21:30): Amazing. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:21:30): Did they keep this to themselves, how they did this? I think this is what sets Facebook's approach apart. Anay Shah (02:21:38): This first part they needed to do, and they executed extremely well. But the second thing they did was far more revolutionary. In a very secretive world of data center development where each hyperscaler kept their builds to themselves, in April of 2011, Facebook open sourced their blueprints. They announced the Open Compute Project. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:22:01): It's hard to overstate how radically different an approach this was. This is an industry that kept the design of the servers in the data centers extremely secretive. They viewed that as core IP, differentiation, and notions of security. Google would publish papers, especially on things like PUE, and be visible about metrics that they wanted to highlight. But they famously didn't let anyone into their data centers until this really changed the game. Anay Shah (02:22:29): Their motivation is pretty interesting. They look around at all the other big data center companies and they're seeing all the margins that are being made. They're like, 'Well, wait a minute, if we publish our blueprints and we get everyone else to buy in and publish theirs, that means we can drive down the costs by standardizing what we're building.' Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:22:50): Ultimately, what they want is for their suppliers to be in increased competition. The best way to do that is not to make one deal with one supplier, but to say, 'Hey, suppliers, this is what we need, this is what we like. You make this, we'll buy it as long as it's the cheapest one out there.' Anay Shah (02:23:04): Yeah, it flips the power dynamic. Now, instead of the vendors and suppliers dictating what the specs are and having multiple different specs for multiple different customers, they're able to standardize it and say, 'You're going to respond to the Open Compute Project standards.' Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:23:17): And it was directionally aligned with all the innovation that we saw at Google. There's actually a big parallel echo here, right? Google built all of these in-house software orchestration tools that we talked about that made the data center reliable. Facebook grew up in that open-source world and benefited from that, and was able to build on top of that. So it's not surprising that they're the ones to look at the hardware design and say, 'Why is this any different? We don't want to be the sole developers of this part of our infrastructure.' It actually benefits us to have other developers and the ecosystem in part because — and this really gets to a business model motivation — we're not trying to sell that innovation. We're not trying to sell anything to another business other than ads on our feed. The better and the cheaper this infrastructure is, the better our business margins are going to be. Anay Shah (02:24:05): Yeah, we want to take this cost item and reduce it, so we can put more of our budget, more of our focus, onto the core business. They're looking at it and they're like, 'Well, the industry is using a 19-inch rack because that's what the telcos did.' 'Well, that's not suiting what we needed. There's no reason for the 19-inch rack. It was just a legacy element.' So Facebook decides to do it differently. They widen it to 21 inches and publish that to make it more efficient and fit their needs better. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:24:33): It's this funny thing how companies are open strategically, so it's important to be clear-eyed about what they're open about and what they're not. Would Facebook publish publicly the exact way that their News Feed ranking works? No. But that's very different than this infrastructure layer that benefits them when the ecosystem adopts it. I think one thing that's amazing about it is how much the industry rallied around it and started to join it. OCP ripples across the industry. Microsoft starts bringing their designs into it. Google contributes big improvements, like we talked about, their 48-volt design. Telcos and everyone joins this, and it has the intended desired flywheel effect. Anay Shah (02:25:12): It did normalize the idea of transparency, and this was right around the time where companies like Google at first were publishing their PUE. So, this notion that we can be transparent with our results as a way to drive the industry forward, bring down costs, and make this whole part of the business easier for everyone, spurred more competition. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:25:33): This kicked off the sustainability race among these four hyperscalers. I would say this started all the way back in 2007 when Google announced that they would achieve operational carbon neutrality. Anay Shah (02:25:43): Each of the companies followed, and they were serious. Right? Microsoft committed to carbon-neutral operations in 2012. It drove site selection, their power purchase agreements, and how they negotiated and determined who they were going to work with and their relationship with their utilities. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:26:01): And it just accelerates. Amazon kicks off the Climate Pledge to get net-zero by 2040. You have zero-waste goals. Microsoft announced water-positive by 2030 in 2020. Google catches up with a similar announcement a year later. So you just have this era of accelerating commitments and goals. I think it's good to ask, why is this? Does it just feel good? Having worked at some of these companies, I do genuinely think the leadership wants the company to have a positive environmental impact, and it is the economically right thing to do as well. These goals of efficiency lead to your data centers, which are a growing item of operational scale, costing you less and less. The other thing this does is catalyze different renewable buying and procurement habits, right? These teams, like the one led by Brian Janis at Microsoft, become energy-buying procurement machines. They're looking to help accelerate that next solar project, that next wind project, to then be able to buy — via what's called a virtual power purchase agreement — the accounting for the clean electrons. Google pushes this even one step further to say, 'Hey, we want to buy electrons that are generated at the same time that our data center is using electrons.' So we want this notion of 24/7 carbon-free electricity. This really pushes the clean energy ecosystem forward, I think, in a material way. If we look at these three commercial cloud businesses of AWS, GCP, and Azure, they are behemoths, as we said. Azure hit $75 billion last year, GCP surpassed $50 billion, and AWS was on a run rate of $111 billion for that business. You total that up, that's $236 billion a year spent only on the direct cloud infrastructure businesses. Anay Shah (02:27:51): Let's put this in perspective. That's $236 billion across these three companies spent on the infrastructure. US consumers spend $500 billion annually on electricity. So we're talking about half the spend of all residential electricity across this country. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:28:10): So I think it is safe to say that we have now entered the utility era of computing. It just so happens that the utilities are Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. Meanwhile, Meta, first of all, doesn't want to buy power from those three utilities. They also use so much themselves that they want to build their own and have no interest in selling access to it. They just need their own data centers to run everything that they're doing in-house at such an immense scale. So we end the 2010s with a very mature cloud, right? I think it's almost in the background. People don't even need to talk about and explain the cloud anymore. It's like, 'Of course, this is how you're going to start and run your company.' The functionality is all grown up. All of the companies are now running containerized Kubernetes things. Your services are portable. Yes, they have their functional differences and their sales differences, but they're all kind of mature and stable, multi-region. All of this stuff going on. Anay Shah (02:29:04): Nobody asks, 'Do you have a cloud strategy anymore?' It just is the way business is done. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:29:08): You also have the new startups that have built out the missing pieces. You have the Snowflakes of the world that are helping build more specialized databases. You have Datadog helping you with orchestration — real significant public-scale businesses that have built the missing components of the cloud moment. Anay Shah (02:29:23): And the feeling right now is one of maturity of the cloud infrastructure, maturity of a new large-scale data center build-out, and at the same time, a huge pressure to continue to build. There is a global race; it is fierce, it is competitive, and it has many, many more players than just these hyperscalers. To give you a sense, Microsoft scaled from 35 regions to 75 regions over the period of a couple of years. So they were adding an entire region a month. This is data center region build-outs. Deal size was ballooning at the same time. A decade ago, a large lease might have been 5 megawatts. You fast forward to the end of the 2010s, and every one of the hyperscalers is reserving 100-megawatt campuses. So, a 20x growth in the size of the data center over this decade. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:30:21): These two big points fit. The whole idea that the cloud now can be taken for granted and invisible is because of these scaled, global build-outs. You don't get to do that if the thing isn't just working as usage is exploding across the entire industry. Anay Shah (02:30:35): The industry has matured around private equity money coming in. You've got developers treating this as a real estate asset class, and they're stockpiling land, pre-building substations ahead of demand because they know what the hyperscaler or the next large company is going to need, and they're going to snap up that capacity. So this build-out is fierce on land. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:30:56): Not only is it fierce on land, it's fierce in the seas. It's not enough just to have your own servers and your own buildings and your own power infrastructure. You need confidence that you can stay connected. The best way to have confidence is to put your own cables underwater. So instead of just renting capacity, which of course they continue to do, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and others start financing and building their own undersea network. This way, they can control end-to-end. You think about Google's vertical integration: it starts with the box, it goes to the rack, then it goes to the building, then it goes to the campus, then it goes to the wires that connect the campus. That's how you get confidence in what you're building. This leads to improved economics and improved performance. Anay Shah (02:31:38): And performance continues to drive forward. But by the end of the 2010s, PUE had plateaued around an incredible 1.1. Only 10% of the power being used in this facility is not directly for the server and IT equipment. So, as we talked about in the sustainability race, the bragging rights had shifted. The marketing teams had moved off of PUE, and now they're talking about carbon intensity (CUE). Now we're talking about water intensity (WUE), and the holy grail metric here is who is launching 24/7 real-time renewable-powered data centers. Everyone's putting out their climate pledges, building into their plans, and driving the entire renewable energy and PPA world forward through this genuine focus on carbon intensity. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:32:28): Intensity. The cloud by 2020 was doing what it needed to do. So we now had this scaled, mature global technology for storing things, computing things, connecting all of us, streaming content, and powering video calls. Why might that be helpful as we go into 2020? Anay Shah (02:32:48): Well, Ben, we're now upon everyone's favorite moment in recent history: the dark days of the COVID pandemic — a time where we all had to stay at home and a time where society, systems, public health, everything was stretched to the max. The same actually goes for our data center infrastructure. While the 2010s saw fast, consistent growth of cloud computing, COVID compressed five years of adoption into about 18 months with everyone at home. Video calls, gaming, online collaboration, telehealth, e-commerce, SaaS — everything surged all at once. We all remember the endless video calls, but let's put that into perspective a little bit. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:33:35): Going into this era, Zoom had something like 10 million folks as daily meeting participants. Fast forward to March 2020: they hit 200 million in four months. One month later, 300 million. So, just explosive growth. Google Meet similarly saw 3 million new users per day in April. Peak usage was up 30x since January, and gaming was exploding. They're at home, looking for entertainment, so Steam is shattering records. Anay Shah (02:34:03): Netflix and YouTube famously had to throttle down the network speed to lower resolutions to avoid essentially breaking the Internet. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:34:11): I was at Stripe at the time, and to the e-commerce point, it was just this explosive moment where, sure, you saw some businesses, perhaps in travel in particular, struggle and go under. But the majority of Stripe's users were exploding. Everyone was ordering stuff online. Instacart and DoorDash were booming. It's easy to say five years of growth in 18 months. What does it actually feel like when you're working on the infrastructure? It feels like everything is breaking, and you're trying to make sure no one in the outside world feels it. We managed to accomplish that, and I'm very proud of that. The API stayed up, and payments were processed even as they scaled rapidly. Anay Shah (02:34:45): Another company in the crosshairs that seized the day was obviously Zoom. They had to scale infrastructure from 10 million to 300 million users in months. They added servers in colocation metros, they used AWS, they used Azure, and they expanded aggressively on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. They were just doing everything they could to ensure that those video calls didn't have delays. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:35:09): Under the hood, the way Zoom works, you can think of it split into two: the Zoom Control Plane, which was making sure that it would respond to your logins and understand what you are as a participant in a meeting. But then you actually had the video feed, and that would have these meeting zones where Zoom would make sure to connect you to the closest meeting zone in a carrier-dense building. So it's kind of very similar to the CDN networks that we talked about earlier with Netflix, but it had this dual, bi-directional nature to it. They were in a race to add more of these peering machines in those telco hotels that we talked about earlier. Anay Shah (02:35:41): And Zoom became proof that the cloud's elastic promise was real. In the greatest stress test of its time, capacity could materialize as fast as humanity demanded it. This was the moment. We were in an era of exploding demand, and there are a few key themes that affect the data center world in this moment. One of them is famously known as ZIRP. On March 15, 2020, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut its target rate to the range of 0 to 25 basis points. What does that mean in the infrastructure world? That basically lowers the hurdle rate for your risk for speculative builds. So now campuses and shells can be built out way ahead of leases being signed because the carrying cost of that infrastructure was so low, because your cost of capital is so low. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:36:33): You're buying a house. This was the time when your interest rate on the mortgage was as low as possible, so you could buy more house. Well, if you are a company trying to build data centers, it's the same story. You can buy more data centers. Your same amount of principal is going to go much further in building out more. Anay Shah (02:36:50): As a company in this infrastructure environment, you can take more risk. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:36:54): The hyperscalers took advantage of this and started pouring money into building new data centers. But so did Blackstone. In 2021, Blackstone purchased QTS Realty Trust, one of the largest data center builders in the industry, for $10 billion. Anay Shah (02:37:07): There's so much capital floating around, and the beauty of the data center asset class was that it had started to look very predictable. It was looking like utility-style returns. Everyone's investing in the REITs and the infrastructure debt. This is fantastic for the counties that were building this out, namely Loudoun County, which we've talked about before. Right? Their budgets were suffering in the COVID era, but because they're Data Center Alley, they saw their server equipment tax go past $400 million annually, and that prevented them from needing to raise property taxes to fill their budget gaps. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:37:46): I think at some point their vacancy was below 1% in all of this. So there's just so much demand for space, colocation, interconnection. Everything is just flying off the shelves. Anay Shah (02:37:56): Another major theme here is what is defining the build-out. What you find now is that it starts to grow the panic around the urgency for electrical supply. It was both the amount of supply of power that you want, as well as the time to power, because there is this capital looking to go to work. The question was actually, 'How soon can you get me the power?' Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:38:23): This is new, right? The scale of the data centers earlier — these 5, 10, 15-megawatt data centers — didn't necessitate a big conversation with the utility. We're now talking into the 50 to 100-megawatt builds, and this changes the dynamic with suppliers. We had folks in Ireland saying for the first time, 'We're going to pass regulation that says the utility can block a data center from coming in because it's too much load.' Anay Shah (02:38:47): You can't just walk up to a utility and plug in for 100 megawatts. For the first time, grid capacity and planning was a throttling factor in how fast data infrastructure could grow. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:39:01): The era from 2010 to 2018-2019, which was this big shift to the cloud that we talked about, was one of increased efficiency in these systems that ended up balancing out the increase in demand and capacity. So there's actually relatively flat power-use growth despite there being so much growth. While there was more demand, it was a steady increase, and the efficiency jumps could go in concert with the growth jumps. Anay Shah (02:39:30): So you buy a new phone, you buy a new computer — most of it's all the same, except you just get more processing power because of Moore's Law. That brought about these efficiency gains. We were building a lot of new data centers and compute, but total energy consumption of data centers actually remained relatively flat throughout this period. It was largely due to a few factors. One is that we moved into the... Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:39:54): ...cloud, and everything we talked about earlier with utilization can then come into play, right? Anay Shah (02:39:59): Exactly. One study found that the cloud is 93% more efficient than running your compute power on-premises because you have less wasted assets combined with everything we talked about with PUE and driving down that efficiency. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:40:14): Well, now all of a sudden you had COVID plus ZIRP, where you're not waiting to get more efficient; you're just trying to build more and more. Anay Shah (02:40:22): We'd also kind of run out of that low-hanging fruit, right? PUE is at 1.1. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:40:28): So if you look at the big four that we talked about before — Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta — between 2017 and 2021, in those four years, they doubled their energy use to 72 terawatt-hours in 2021. Anay Shah (02:40:40): So much greater demand, combined with a loss of the PUE benefits and the cloud efficiency, means we're in a new paradigm of power usage, and the industry is having to reckon with that. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:40:52): It's pretty amazing that we had such a flat period for how much growth that we just talked through. I mean, the whole scale-up of the cloud led to growing usage, while the efficiency gains were so significant. We've run out of those tricks. Right? Anay Shah (02:41:05): Right. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:41:06): The hot and cold aisles are contained. We've virtualized everything; we've containerized everything. We need to come up with some new tricks. I hold out some optimism that necessity is the mother of invention, and we'll figure out some new tricks because we'll have to. Anay Shah (02:41:18): We have to. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:41:20): That being said, there is an extreme way that a new power user is showing up in this era. Let's talk about the crypto miners for a bit. Anay Shah (02:41:29): Let's talk a little bit about crypto because it's not just a hobby, but actually ends up being a competitive buyer in the data center infrastructure build-out. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:41:40): By 2022, 100 to 150 terawatt hours. So that's almost 50% of what the rest of the data centers are consuming now going to crypto mining. Go back to 2009, Bitcoin launches, and it's pretty much just a dark corners of the internet thing, right? Someone mining on a PC in their bedroom. Then, finally, folks figure if you buy GPUs off the shelf, you can go faster, and people start even designing custom ASICs that are designed to do nothing but mine Bitcoin and other coins. By the mid-2010s, mines had become significant power loads, and folks had started to build these out wherever they could find cheap electricity. Anay Shah (02:42:14): And while the technology behind crypto was interesting from a business perspective, it was less of an IT business and more of a power arbitrage business, because it was all based on how efficiently you could mine and where you're doing it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:42:29): Hard math computation as many times as you can. This is purely solving problems using power. And this is very, very different than everything we've said about data centers before. This is just compute as cheaply as possible. Anay Shah (02:42:43): And this really comes to a collision point in the real world where you had markets like Iceland and Eastern Washington where Bitcoin miners were outbidding these cloud providers for the cheap hydro and the power that was available. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:42:57): Then the crypto industry starts to realize that there's power that's not useful to others. Let's look for ways and places to put crypto mining that you couldn't even put a data center or a normal industrial load. You're in an oil field and you're flaring excess gas. What if you put a turbine there, burn that, and power a crypto mine? This is how Crusoe, which later became one of the premier AI data center build-outs, got started finding that cheap power source. And so, it's interesting how many of these power-related innovations came from the crypto moment. Anay Shah (02:43:27): Then, crypto loads were different. They were large, but they were fairly mobile. So that was an advantage in terms of where and how quickly they could place. But it also meant that policy could step in and shape the industry fairly quickly. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:43:39): By 2021, most crypto mining was happening in China. There was the cheapest power. It was close to where the hardware was being manufactured. But in 2021, China cracked down. There was no more crypto mining. So all the miners fled to Texas, to Kazakhstan, to Canada. And so, by early 2022, the US share of crypto miners was back up to almost 40%. This is up from 3 to 4% in 2020. Anay Shah (02:44:03): What started out as a hobby and took over the fintech world and financial infrastructure forced real estate, power, and the compute industry to wrestle with how to connect very large, very flexible loads to stressed grids. And what innovations can be born out of trying to wrestle with that. On that point, crypto as an industry didn't care much about its footprint. But the rest of the industry, and the data center industry in particular, continued to be very focused on the carbon intensity of their operations. Now, these hyperscalers were tracking their carbon footprints with extreme precision. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:44:40): By 2020, Amazon became the world's largest buyer of renewable energy. It's a scale thing. Amazon signed the climate pledge. And for Amazon to hit net zero, they didn't just have to decarbonize their data centers and offices; they had fulfillment centers and travel of unprecedented scale, delivering all the packages. Anay Shah (02:44:59): And this is beyond just the quote-unquote "right thing to do." As we've talked about, oftentimes the cheapest, most economical way to get new load onto the grid and scale is through renewable power. And in a zero-interest-rate environment, it actually makes these PPAs more and more attractive, and it lowers the hurdle rate. So, a wind project that might otherwise have been too expensive in this environment is profitable and able to be signed on to a Microsoft new build-out. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:45:30): It's hard to appreciate the flywheel of more demand for the data center services driving data center build-out, which can be funded by a zero-interest-rate environment, which then all drives all the renewable energy build-out, which is similarly funded by the zero-interest-rate environment. You just had an infrastructure build flywheel running that set us all up for what might come next. Anay Shah (02:45:53): It was an extremely timely moment in the evolution of data centers and actually served as a dress rehearsal for the unprecedented scale that we are going to see in the AI boom. This moment during COVID, with cheap capital flooding the system, was driving a massive new build-out. Power was starting to become a much more limiting reagent in the development of our infrastructure, and there was a breaking down of our global supply chains which was feeding this build-out. All this happened at this moment, right before a massive boom. So, now we've spoken about the companies building the big infrastructure, the big servers powering our life, and we have a $4 trillion elephant in the room that I think it's time to introduce. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:46:40): It's now time to talk about Nvidia. Nvidia started as a company that was trying to figure out how to make gaming run faster on computers. So, they made gaming chips. They did this for years and years and years. And I remember them recruiting many a student out of the Stanford EE department to go work on gaming chips. Anay Shah (02:46:59): They were very much tied to the gaming industry. Their growth was correlated to it. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:47:05): But it turns out the same thing that you're doing in a game — which is doing a bunch of math to figure out how to render a pixel on a screen — is what you sometimes need to do complex science: a bunch of tough math problems at once. And if you're going to build a cryptocurrency, what are you doing? As we said earlier: a bunch of tough math problems at once. Anay Shah (02:47:21): A lot of compute, matrix multiplication at... Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:47:24): Scale, to such an extent that their stock price starts to get tied to what's going on in crypto mining. Anay Shah (02:47:29): First, they had been tied to the game industry; now they became even more correlated to crypto. And then, in 2018, you have the crypto winter. That fall in the crypto industry dragged Nvidia's stock down 17% in one day. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:47:45): Over that period, they got cut in half. Anay Shah (02:47:47): And so, enter COVID, and you hit a crypto boom-bust cycle. But machine learning algorithms are spitting out more and more recommendations to us as we're sitting on YouTube and Netflix and Instagram. And you know what powers a recommendation model? An Nvidia GPU. And so, growth of these training models takes off. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:48:08): And you can see it as a line item, right? In their earnings, they have this carve-out for what they call their data center business, which is really the growth of this business. You see 60% growth. Anay Shah (02:48:18): This hit nearly $4 billion in just a quarter. And this consisted mostly of their A100 chips. They were selling thousands of these. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:48:26): Right. And so, these A100 chips became the backbone of the early era of training models. So, in 2020, Microsoft announced the next stage of their partnership with OpenAI. They committed to buying 10,000 or more of these A100 chips to build a special data center, a special supercomputer for OpenAI to continue developing their models. And remember, at this time, OpenAI was not really a household name; it was... Anay Shah (02:48:47): ...a research project, right? Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:48:48): Yeah, I mean, that's right. It was a leading, well-funded AI lab with this deep collaboration with Microsoft, building models that were available via API. And in the same year, they published a paper that really demonstrated something that they had discovered and what they call their scaling laws, showing that the bigger the compute and the larger the data set you threw at the problem, the better the model. And Google was discovering very much the same thing: the more chips, the better the model. Anay Shah (02:49:15): How convenient. The more chips, the better the model. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:49:18): Music to Jensen's ears, I think. Anay Shah (02:49:21): Indeed. And so, in 2022, right as the crypto crash was coming, OpenAI released a new model, GPT-3.5. It was a huge upgrade from GPT-3, and they had built it in their new Microsoft data center. And they were thinking about new ways to show to the world the value of what they've been able to build. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:49:41): Are you saying not everyone wants to use an API sandbox to understand how good a model is? Anay Shah (02:49:45): Right now it's a little bit hard to access, but maybe if you put a simple box as a UI and create a little chat feature on the GPT, it'd be a... Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:49:59): Nice demo at least, right? Anay Shah (02:50:00): Right. Few people might be interested, so they decided to put out this chat function. On November 30, 2022, ChatGPT launched. In five days, they had a million users. This was far and away beyond the team's expectations, as well as their capacity planning. According to Sam Altman, they expected an order of magnitude less interest by January 2023. ChatGPT has become the fastest-growing consumer software application in history. So, after getting a million users in five days, they crossed 100 million users in just two months. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:50:41): By this last summer, ChatGPT's website was among the top five most visited sites in the world, right after Instagram. So there was real consumer and enterprise pull. The world had been waiting for AI to be a thing for a very long time, but this was the moment where everyone said, "Okay, this is it. This is the time." Anay Shah (02:50:59): It ended up with over a billion prompts a day. People were loving this thing. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:51:02): And everyone knew, to make it better, we just needed more chips. Why is Jensen so delighted? Where are we now? Anay Shah (02:51:09): Three years later, more chips, better models, right? Three years ago, in 2022, Nvidia's data center revenue was growing rapidly: $4 billion in revenue that quarter. Last quarter, their data center revenue was a staggering $39 billion. That's it growing nearly 10x from what it was in three years. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:51:30): To add $36 billion in quarterly revenue in three years, it's unprecedented. Anay Shah (02:51:37): This is powered by this discovery of the scaling laws. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:51:41): And the timing of their product launch could not have been better. They had the A100. That was essentially for training — scaling your training. But they launched the H100 in 2022. That was designed for this moment. It was the rocket boost of a chip. It added new special math modes tailored for transformers. It added more high-speed memory. As a result, it slashed training time and made inference faster. Anay Shah (02:52:07): And these H100s are flying off the shelf, from selling a million and a half in 2023 to over 2 million in 2024. And the big players, having learned from past years of the cloud boom and the COVID demand boom, are ordering these in the hundreds of thousands. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:52:23): These things are not cheap. Each chip is like a car, right? $40,000 apiece, supposedly. You couldn't buy one chip at a time. Anay Shah (02:52:32): No. Why would you sell one car at a time when you can put them in boxes? Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:52:35): They really sold in two models, right? There are training boxes and inference boxes. The training box is an 8-GPU box with a CPU in the middle. They're hardwired with this NVLink connection. What's really interesting about this is it's all about making it effectively one big GPU. It's all about creating this really high-bandwidth connection between these GPUs. Because when you're training, that's what you want. In NVLink, if anyone's ever built a computer, you would have what's called a PCI connection in a motherboard. The way your Nvidia graphics card would plug into your computer was using PCI. It felt like a really fast connection. But it's not fast enough for this. So Nvidia invented NVLink. It's up to 15 times faster than that connection. So these eight GPUs can communicate extremely quickly. One training box is about $500K to buy. Then they also launched these inference boxes. And so, this is two GPUs coupled with a bunch of memory. To be clear, inference is when you're asking ChatGPT a question and it's responding. That process of responding is inference. You want a lot of memory to be able to understand all the content in that response. These boxes were designed with a lot of fast memory, connected to be able to share context across the model. Anay Shah (02:53:46): Now, selling these GPUs in a box actually has a physical space implication, right? So you've heard us talk about the racks and racks in the data center as far as the eye can see. These racks have slots for servers, and those servers have a traditional power consumption. But when you put in a specialized server, it starts to change the power consumption of that rack and therefore of the square footage and of the data center. So let's unpack, just for a moment, what's happening at the rack level when AI arrives. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:54:16): Historically, one rack would be maybe 400 watts. So you'd build a rack with 20 to 30 of these servers. You'd have some networking equipment. So, somewhere around 5 to 10 kilowatts of power going to a rack — that's like 10 hair dryers running at the same time, to give you a sense. Now, these GPU boxes arrived — those eight-GPU training boxes. Each of those is up to 10 kilowatts by itself. So it's the same power consumption and heat as the whole rack was. But you could now pack a rack physically with four to eight of those boxes. So, all of a sudden, you're an order of magnitude up in power consumption, up to 90 kilowatts in a rack. This has a bunch of implications, not just for power, but also for cooling. An inference box is somewhere in between; so a whole rack, maybe, is up to 40 kilowatts. Anay Shah (02:55:01): One of the things driving this power conversation we've been having is, again, not only the size of these data centers, but now the density of power required within these data centers. This is what makes an AI-driven data center so much different from a traditional data center. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:55:21): Just 20 of these training racks in a pod is one megawatt of power. That's on the order of a small, 800-person town powering electricity. So, if you get 200 of these racks, you get to an 8,000-person neighborhood very quickly. You get to a gigawatt of Seattle-scale power. Anay Shah (02:55:41): As you pack these GPUs that have higher power density, they run hotter, and you can't let them run hotter. So now, how you cool your GPUs and your racks needs to evolve. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:55:55): The problem is, air can only move heat so quickly. And if you were trying to do that, even with the inference racks, you would need leaf blower-level fans to move the air out. And so you need to start bringing more cooling down to the rack level. So the first thing that you can look at is retrofitting the racks with what's called rear door heat exchangers. This puts some water cooling directly alongside the rack so that when air is moving over those hot chips, some of that air, instead of just going straight into the hot aisle, can get extracted via some tubes of water running inside the rack. That is a nice convenient half-step because you don't have to change how you're actually cooling the overall system. The next jump is the jump to direct chip liquid cooling. This is where you mount cold plates directly on your chips and you run water right near the chip to actually extract the heat away, instead of expecting air and heat sinks to do it. And so, increasingly, especially with the most powerful GPUs—and to be clear, each generation of GPUs gets more powerful and therefore has more heat to remove—we are moving to a water-cooled world. Anay Shah (02:57:03): We've crossed the threshold of physics where air can cool this amount of heat being emitted at this level of density from the racks. And so now it is a liquid-cooling world. Now, at the end of the day, you've got to move the heat from inside to outside. But it's very environment-dependent. In the right climates, you can expel it outside. And that's why we saw some of these data centers looking at Finland and Oregon and certain geographies that enable that to happen. And this consumes very little water. But in other climates, you have large evaporated water cooling towers. This is where the problem of the water impact on the local community starts to come into play. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:57:45): Fundamentally, what we're trying to do is we're removing heat through that phase change, right? You're evaporating water; that's a massive transfer of heat. These towers increase the surface area of the water. Water evaporates out. It looks like steam going up from these cooling towers. And it's a very effective and efficient way to cool things down. But it can use up your water. Anay Shah (02:58:03): And so you end up with this energy-water trade-off in certain environments. And that becomes a big planning focus not only for data centers that are working with their local community, but also those that are power-constrained and built by companies that care about carbon intensity. One study Google did in 2022 found that water-cooled data centers use about 10% less energy, which means they emit about 10% less carbon emissions than many of the air-cooled data centers. Now, the problem is, you can't do this as easily in water-stressed areas. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:58:38): So there's essentially this knob you can dial up and down. To be clear, it's possible to build data centers that don't use any water, but they're going to use more electricity to run an air conditioner in your house. You're not using a bunch of water, but you're taking a ton of energy. And so I would argue if we care about water, the best thing we can do is have clean electricity to make this an easier trade-off to make. Anay Shah (02:59:00): So if you zoom out and look at water, globally, data centers consume over 550 billion liters of water annually, which is a big number. To put that into context, a single 100-megawatt data center can consume 2 million liters a day, or the amount equivalent to 6,500 U.S. households per day, both direct and indirect water usage. So this is a very big, real, and current issue for data centers in terms of where they site their data center, how they get permitted, and the ongoing operations. Ben Shwab Eidelson (02:59:35): The local question is hyper-important. Some reporting that The New York Times did about the situation in Georgia where, supposedly, when Meta broke ground on their billion-dollar data center build-out, water taps in some residents nearby went dry. And there's some back and forth around whether or not you can prove direct causality. Still working out whether or not that is actually the case, caused by that data center. But it is known to be true that that data center is using about 10% of the county's total water and it's driving water prices in the region to go up. Anay Shah (03:00:06): So now let's dive into what is the largest constraint to data center build-outs today, and that is power. We've talked about the evolution of power moving up the decision stack. From the early 2010s through the COVID era, and now in the AI era, power is really the limiting reagent. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:00:30): The image in my mind is: we have the largest, most complex machine that humankind has built in the power grid that has brought us such evolution in how we live our life. And it is colliding with the new, complex, most interesting machine of the data center. And this collision and the force of it that we're living through right now is defining this period. Anay Shah (03:00:53): And it is no small collision. It is a function of two things, right? It's a function of speed and a function of scale. So, as we've seen, there is an absolute arms race on compute, because the faster you can get compute online, the better your models are, the more revenue you're going to make. And timing matters a lot here because a model trained in 2025 can become obsolete by 2027. So if you have a two-year delay in getting your data center online because of the power grid, it becomes a dealbreaker. It has to happen now, coupled with the scale of these data centers. And so, as we talked about, a typical data center started as 5 to 10 megawatts. Then, just a few years ago, we were in the 50 to 100 megawatts. And now this year we're starting to see gigawatt-scale announcements. Now, to be clear, these are campuses that make up a gigawatt. There are multiple facilities, but they are still being built out cohesively and will put a strain on the grid and the local community at a gigawatt scale. Now, to put a gigawatt in perspective. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:02:00): This is the scale of a city's power consumption, right? Maybe a Pittsburgh or Cleveland. And Google's data center electricity use doubled over four years and was up to 30 million megawatt-hours in 2024 from 14 and a half million megawatt-hours in 2020. To put that all into perspective, that's about 3 million U.S. homes, or around three-quarters of a percent of all U.S. electricity consumption. Anay Shah (03:02:22): Which checks out, right? If data centers are currently about 4% of U.S. electricity use, I guess it makes sense that Google's about a fifth of that. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:02:31): And it's worth pausing there for a second to talk about that 4% electricity use. When I hear that number, it actually seems shockingly small. For all of the discussion of data centers and electricity, it's like, okay, it's 4%. Let's say it goes to 8%. Compared to industry, compared to cooling and heating buildings. It all feels small. So why might this be such an issue of conflict? Anay Shah (03:02:54): It's a great question. It might have to do with the fact that it's misleading to think about it in terms of total national electricity use, because a data center has a localized and concentrated impact, right? You're not spreading this load across multiple utilities. And not only is it localized and concentrated, it's localized and concentrated in similar areas. Because, as we've been talking about, the network effect of the value of a data center being positioned near the undersea cables and near other network points is where you get a lot of performance gains. And so you end up concentrating yourself in Virginia, in California, in Texas. There's just basically 10 states where you're seeing new data centers come online. And so there's a tremendous impact at a local level—at the electricity prices for that community, that county, and in that state—but not necessarily at a national level. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:03:52): We talk gigawatt scale. That is all about these large training clusters. When we're talking about inference—which is, hey, ChatGPT, processing your response—you actually probably want that spread out, right? You want that closer to the edge, and that's where you need it close to the interconnect, because you want it to not have latency when interacting with the user and their data. Anay Shah (03:04:10): So let's talk a little bit about why you need a gigawatt data center or a 5-gigawatt data center to do the best training possible. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:04:17): You don't really want to think about it as one GPU or a rack of GPUs or a building of GPUs. You want, as much as possible, the whole data center to act together. Because the way that a transformer actually trains is that it makes guesses about what should come next, and then it compares that to reality, and then it tunes the weights across it. And you're doing that collectively across the whole model. And to do that, you need all of the computers working on the problem to be able to communicate quickly. Otherwise, the whole thing is training slowly. The faster those exchanges can happen, the better. And so you want the connectivity between chips to be as fast as possible. You want the connectivity between boxes of chips to be as fast as possible. And so it does not work if all of a sudden half of your computers are on the East Coast and half are on the West Coast, because the speed of light across the country is going to slow you down by multiple orders of magnitude than within one campus, within one center. And that's why Meta wants to build a 5-gigawatt campus because that's going to get them the biggest training model possible. Anay Shah (03:05:21): There's also an interesting nuance here where training models hit higher load factors than an inference model. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:05:30): And in a typical data center, you're trying to run this all at once and you're utilizing ideally all your expensive chips. And so all of that leads to a higher utilization and more power and more compute. Anay Shah (03:05:43): So we talked about the speed. More time to power is time to revenue. We've talked about the scale, now going from 100 megawatts to gigawatts. So this creates an objective function when we're thinking about the power constraint on data center growth. And that ends up being: how do we secure large 24/7 power where you need it, when you need it, quickly and ideally as clean as possible? Should be easy, right? Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:06:13): Oh, wait. Not to mention there are supply chain bottlenecks in transformers, bottlenecks in gas turbines, and bottlenecks— Anay Shah (03:06:20): In labor and in specialty skills. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:06:22): We don't have the most up-to-date, freshest grid with transmission lines. So this gets into a very tense moment and an area that arguably breeds innovation. Anay Shah (03:06:33): So the reality is, getting affordable power that is 24/7, quickly and cleanly, is going to be very rare. That Goldilocks situation doesn't really exist today. And so we're going to have to compromise on at least one of those variables. Now you've got a few different options to get these data centers online, right? You can either hook it up to the grid and use power that already exists. You can build new generation of power that's off the grid and power that data center, do some sort of hybrid in between, and over the long term, we can build out large new generation like nuclear, geothermal, and others. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:07:14): Watching this closely, there are both a lot of moments of concern, right, because we're at times doing things like keeping a coal plant running longer than we might have otherwise. But there are also a lot of interesting moments of innovation. A lot of growth in storage to help supplement what's going on and smooth out power generation, and co-locating these in new hybrid ways. Anay Shah (03:07:34): And there's a tension that's largely dictated by timing, right? There's a near-term pain that local communities are facing when you bring a data center online and potentially increase electricity prices. But there's also cause for optimism because you've got well-funded companies who have an interest in long-term sustainable power. And the fact of the matter is, the most affordable, long-term sustainable power we have is going to be clean and renewable. And so this moment actually offers an opportunity for us to accelerate a lot of new clean build on the grid and reshape our electricity infrastructure. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:08:10): I think, at the end of the day, there's also a big issue of incentives. These hyperscalers, they want to build these models. Now, many of them are used to mostly still building their businesses on software-based timescales. And the reality is, despite all the discussion of the utilities and electricity, for them, it's a bottleneck. The actual cost of energy for them to build the biggest models is like 2 to 6%. It is all in the people and the hardware. It is all in the chips and the humans. And so for them, it's all, as you said earlier, this speed to getting out there. And that's not how our system is set up. That's not how our incentive structures are set up, right? Anay Shah (03:08:51): That's right, because the utility supplying that power operates on an entirely different paradigm. In a typical electric utility, power delivered in 2027 is valued at the same amount as power delivered in 2030. Utilities don't differentiate those products, but for the customer—a Google or Meta—there's a massive difference for their business. They need power today. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:09:17): How much more would they pay if they could get power now versus three years from now? Anay Shah (03:09:21): And how much could we unlock in terms of investment into our utilities if they could take advantage of the fact that companies are willing to pay a lot more today than in two years? Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:09:31): Brian Janis calls this the Watt-bit spread. It's the economic arbitrage between an available Watt and the ability to turn that into a bit. Reality is, the speed of regulatory change in utility tariff pricing—which is a fancy way of saying how quickly the utility can change anything about their economics—is slow. And so despite there being an obvious market demand structure, it's not going to change in the next 12 months the way that utilities price their product. Anay Shah (03:10:03): Utilities are public goods, right? They power our lives and our schools and our hospitals. And so for good reason, they are regulated. But because they are regulated, they take time to change. And moreover, we have a federated system. We have some 3,000 different utilities across the United States. And so making that change across this country, or even in the 10 states where data centers are getting built out, will take a lot of time. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:10:27): Power has become the dominant question of: where can you build your data center? Because you can't go do it without that. But it didn't remove the fact that the other questions still remain. For example, you need people to go build a data center; you need a lot of electricians; you need all the components and the supply chain and the things to build the transformers to step down the power. Anay Shah (03:10:48): Based on how we've been talking about this, you might think that data centers are almost entirely a U.S. story. And while the U.S. is the dominant builder of data centers, there is actually a global story here and global infrastructure being built out, and a strong need for sovereignty for other nations. So in order to help understand what's going on here, let's go back in time a little bit to understand the drama that's setting in globally. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:11:19): I think it's worth looking at just fairly recently. In 2018, Europe passed GDPR, and that set this world baseline for privacy. Thank you. All the cookie pop-ups, but also really tight controls on where EU data sits and what happens if you have EU resident data outside of the EU. And so this is really, I think, a reaction to where people are storing data about our citizens. And so there are controls about what happens if you're holding or transferring data outside of the EU. Anay Shah (03:11:51): In 2018, the U.S. passed the CLOUD Act, which essentially lets U.S. authorities lawfully demand data from U.S. providers, even if that data sits on servers outside of— Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:12:03): the U.S. And so the net effect is if you're working with EU data at scale, you start to need to have servers and hard drives in the EU. And this becomes, I think, almost another lock-in that the big cloud providers start to have because they go and build the infrastructure to do that. Anay Shah (03:12:19): And we saw this in the Microsoft story, right? A big part of their early scaling was following their enterprise customers globally and needing to build out data centers in Germany as one of the primary cases. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:12:31): And so if the EU-U.S. looks like a little tiff drama, I think it's time to move to the major geopolitical data center drama, which some have— Anay Shah (03:12:41): deemed the new Cold War. And there's a book called *The Chips War*, which centers around this notion of the U.S. and now China in a fight over everything. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:12:57): But centered on this technology, right? So, I mean, let's go back to 2012, which I think really kicked off this last decade. Fifteen years of animosity here. The House Intelligence Committee report warned U.S. carriers away from using Huawei and ZTE equipment, saying that we shouldn't use this in any sensitive government system. Now that, of course, starts to spiral outside of just government use. Anay Shah (03:13:21): That was first with the carriers. Beijing responded on a different front: the data front. So in 2017, China's Cybersecurity Law, followed by other laws, pushed data localization and tighter state control. And so the U.S. companies had to respond by localizing operations, which essentially means AWS, Apple, Azure: they either had to sell off to Chinese partners or find a Chinese government-linked company to be a partner. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:13:49): That's right. So it's not just that those companies' hard disks and servers had to be in China, but they actually had to be owned and operated by a Chinese company. And so then the U.S. reacted even further. They barred all federal agencies from buying or using equipment from a long list of covered Chinese vendors. And they barred the FCC from approving any new authorizations from Huawei, ZTE, and others. So this just ramped up further and further. Anay Shah (03:14:14): This brewing war was not just limited to land, but also involves our friends, the undersea cables. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:14:21): Right. Anay Shah (03:14:21): And so in 2016, Google and Facebook partnered with a Hong Kong-based company to build the Pacific Light Cable Network, a massive 12,000-kilometer undersea cable linking Los Angeles to Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Philippines. Part of that global network of undersea cables we were talking about earlier. Seems like a great idea. What could go wrong? Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:14:44): And fast forward four years later, to 2020. U.S. national security officials say, "We don't know about this Hong Kong landing point anymore." We think that's going to be a vehicle for Beijing to have surveillance across this important backbone of the internet. And so the FCC ultimately blocked that route. And so now the cable hits Taiwan and the Philippines, and those are lit up. But the Hong Kong branch that's been laid, I believe, is just lying dark. Anay Shah (03:15:10): So I'm sitting here in Los Angeles without that cable to Hong Kong. Now, moving back to land and to chips. The battle continues. And so in 2022, the Commerce Department rolls out these sweeping controls on advanced AI chips and fab tools. And so, remember, this is the moment where we've gone through a COVID boom. We're seeing an uptake in usage from crypto and streaming. And now AI, and the Commerce Department tightens these controls again in 2023 and again in 2024. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:15:43): And this feels very active, right? I mean, literally every quarter of Nvidia's earnings, there are discussions of this. A few weeks ago, the U.S. opened a channel that said Nvidia could ship certain chips that are dialed back, like the H20. But they have to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of the revenue. It's a pretty unprecedented pay-to-export arrangement, like a lot of things that are unprecedented that are going on. But if you zoom out, it raises some good geopolitical strategic questions on how we want to engage, right? Anay Shah (03:16:11): Yeah. It's foundational to the new economy that's being built on this advanced compute power. And it remains to be seen how this plays out. It may backfire. Right. China is not terribly keen on being dependent on U.S. production, so they are infusing massive amounts of capital in their chip sector. It's still a step behind Nvidia in terms of raw performance and software ecosystem dominance. But given China's resources, you have to assume that that gap is going to narrow and narrow quickly. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:16:46): There's a reason China wanted domestic energy. They want to have their own domestic production of silicon here, and so they've invested heavily and they're catching up. Some estimates are that they're 60 to 70% of Nvidia performance; it depends on what they're doing. But they're investing out of a $50 billion fund to improve chip development. Even more so, they're passing policy that says data centers need to source at least 50% of their chips domestically. So they're making sure to really stand up not just the supply side of the market, but also simultaneously the demand side of the market. Anay Shah (03:17:17): The story is less about whether Chinese chips can equal Nvidia's top-end designs and more about how quickly that's going to happen given the demand and the capital that they're putting in. So in short, at the moment, the US is still ahead, but the China chip ecosystem is accelerating rapidly. Their backlog of demand for Nvidia chips, which is being withheld, is going to matter less and less over time. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:17:43): The other dynamic that you have geopolitically is governments are seeing the AI data center boom as an important future part of their economy. A deal that exemplifies this is the Emirates deal with OpenAI around this UAE Stargate buildout, a one-gigawatt AI cluster in Abu Dhabi, and all the ecosystem players from Oracle to Nvidia to Cisco to SoftBank coming in to finance this and collaborating on the buildout. I think it just raises a lot of interesting questions: What about the location of a data center matters to a government? Anay Shah (03:18:16): And the map is stark. If you look at where AI data centers are located today, only 32 nations have them, and most of them are in the Northern Hemisphere. You have large swaths of Latin America and Africa as fully dark. Governments are deeply, deeply concerned because they are wondering that if you continue to rent compute power from faraway data centers, you remain at the whims and you remain vulnerable to foreign entities and foreign companies, and you aren't able to support domestic enterprise or domestic scientific research or academia with the same level of control. So this idea of compute sovereignty is top of mind for a lot of people, and a lot of emerging markets are worried that the AI era runs the risk of leaving them even further behind economically. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:19:09): There's almost a rough analogy to energy independence, right? Do you have it regardless of your relationship with another country? That feels like the important thread here. Anay Shah (03:19:18): The other tricky dimension here, which if you talk a little bit about, is the actual impact on the climate, which gets a lot of attention these days, rightly so. There are a few questions that continue to come up, and one that Ben, maybe your mom has asked you, I know mine has, is if a ChatGPT query is bad for the climate. If I care about the climate, should I really be using AI? And we have some data on that. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:19:44): There's been some reporting on this, and I think it's an area that's become a pretty hot-button issue for folks. There's been, I think, some people even shaming others for using these tools because of the climate impact. So it's worth looking at the latest numbers. Google actually just put out a publicly readable paper on Gemini where they go down to the details on the energy consumption and the carbon intensity of that energy. The median Gemini text prompt, which for all intents and purposes I think could be viewed as fairly equivalent to a Claude or a ChatGPT or a Copilot prompt, uses 0.24 watt-hours of energy and emits 0.03 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent and consumes 0.26 milliliters or about five drops of water. Those are figures that are substantially lower than what the public estimates have been. For some kind of sense of scale, that per-prompt energy impact is about the same as watching your TV for less than nine seconds. Why do we think the public reporting might be so far off? Anay Shah (03:20:40): There have been a lot of improvements over time, and so it's important to kind of ground ourselves in this moment. We know, through that same report, that the AI systems that we're using are becoming more efficient. There's constant innovation in the software and the hardware to drive more efficiency. So over 12 months, the energy of a standard Gemini text prompt dropped by 33-fold. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:21:04): Wow. Anay Shah (03:21:05): A 33x improvement in the energy consumption. Even more so, from a total carbon footprint per se, we have 44x, all while delivering higher quality responses. So we are moving in a world where the efficiency gains are continuing, and this question of "is your query bad for the climate?" is fairly insignificant. Hannah Ritchie from Our World in Data has independently corroborated this fact. It's an interesting cocktail conversation, but largely misses the forest from the trees. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:21:37): I think the pressure is good positive pressure because one individual query you should not feel bad about. But the pressure for all of these companies to monitor this and drive these numbers down and get these efficiency improvements is a fantastic thing. That's right. And to drive the deployment of clean energy so that the carbon intensity of the energy drives down is a good flywheel to keep pressure on. Anay Shah (03:21:56): Indeed. So, Mom, keep asking a question because Google will then continue to improve. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:22:00): I think there's another area that's been under-discussed. Anay Shah (03:22:03): You don't hear a lot of discussion on the actual carbon intensity of building these very large pieces of infrastructure, pieces of real estate. That's called embodied carbon. So what is the embodied carbon impact of the steel, the cement, the energy used to build a shell and stand up the facility in and of itself? Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:22:27): Thankfully, Google did another report on this and shared that in their analysis. Running an AI data center, the operational emissions, which really means the energy going into running the data center ongoing, is going to be about 70 to 90% of the total emissions. Manufacturing emissions, which is really the manufacturer of the server components, the memory, the flash storage, the GPUs, is going to be around 25%. And then the data center construction, so this is the steel and cement and the logistics around that, are around 5%. So this is all to say, I think when you look at this, we should probably be paying a bit more attention to the manufacturing of the components and make sure that we're looking at the LCAs for solid-state disk drives and GPUs and making sure we're taking that into account. But the attention's probably correctly centered on the electricity. Anay Shah (03:23:14): And on this point of focusing in on the manufacturing, the procurement muscle of one of these companies that are building this out is actually a very big leverage. So when Microsoft requires its suppliers to use 100% carbon-free energy by 2030, it will pull their suppliers, all the fab building and the motherboard building and the assemblers. It's moving everyone down the supply chain — it's called Scope 3 emissions — into a cleaner world, which has tremendous power. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:23:43): I think the other thing that's interesting is some of the circularity conversations are starting to happen. So I was at a talk where the Microsoft CSO was talking about how they recently launched, I think it was just in April of this year, a circularity program where they would take the rare earth material in the hard disk drives that they're using in the data centers, and they have a new way to recycle those while disposing of the data. That yields a 90% recovery of those rare earth materials, which also helps stand up a US supply chain around rare earth materials, which we don't really have today, which is pretty phenomenal. Anay Shah (03:24:13): Yeah. Tremendous. And it's going to be a growing discussion over the coming years as we mine for more and more of these critical minerals and the geopolitical control over who has those minerals. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:24:25): All right, so given all of that operational load, is the main contributor to greenhouse gases something like 70% or more of the emissions? How should we think about the scale of that from a meta-climate perspective? Anay Shah (03:24:38): So when we talk about operations, remember we're talking about the energy consumption and not the materials that go into building the data center. Recent studies show that data centers account for about 4% of total U.S. electricity consumption. And with more than half of that electricity derived from fossil fuels, that means that data centers generate more than 105 million tons of CO2 every year. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:25:04): Until reading the study, I didn't realize that data centers' carbon intensity is actually higher than average, exceeding the U.S. average by 48%. Anay Shah (03:25:12): The big point here is how grid-dependent that impact is. If these data centers are located on a dirtier grid, let's say a coal-heavy grid in the Mid-Atlantic region of Virginia, then it's going to have a very different climate profile than a data center that's in Eastern Washington that's entirely powered by hydro. So when we talk about 105 million tons of CO2, how should we think about that? Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:25:36): A few comparisons to help think about the scale of 105 million tons of CO2 emissions. One is you look at US aviation emissions: this is about half of that. Another would be looking at enteric methane, which is a fancy way of saying cow burps, is around 178 million tons. So that means data centers are about 60% of the equivalent of that. Or all US passenger vehicles are 1,000 million tons, or a gigaton. And so data centers are about 10% of that today. Now, if you look globally, this goes up by approximately a factor of three, as do the rest of these things. So overall, data centers are not insignificant. They're worth tracking on the map here, but quite fractional compared to passenger vehicles, big emitters like livestock, and a third to a half of something like global aviation. The interesting thing, I think, what makes this a hot topic, is not just the current scale, but the projections, right? If all of a sudden we double on our current grid in the US, then now we're caught up to the emissions of aviation in the U.S. And if you keep going from that and you keep the trend line up, you could imagine data centers becoming a fairly dominant story in emissions. Anay Shah (03:26:50): The other leg of the stool in this conversation is how it's affecting the local communities that these data centers are being placed in. One of the themes that we've found come out through this is the impact of these data centers are concentrated and they are disproportionately felt by the environment, the ecology, and the people that immediately surround it. We metaphorically went to Memphis, where XAI is building a very large data center on the banks of the Mississippi, 15 minutes from downtown. And there, Elon is commissioning a 200,000 GPU unit data center. There's been a significant backlash from the Memphis community for good reason. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:27:37): I think a lot of it centers on how are we going to provide power to that? Because the utility said that they can provide XAI power for about 50 megawatts of load, but XAI wants triple that amount. That's a lot of GPUs, and 50 megawatts isn't going to cut it. So they brought in gas turbines — 35 turbines — which could theoretically power 420 megawatts. The problem with that — I mean, it's good they're solving their power problem — but the other problem with that is these are highly polluting gas turbines. So they have the potential to emit a couple thousand tons of smog-forming nitrous oxides each year. For context, that's more than the smog caused by the Memphis airport. So it's like you're adding another airport of smog to the region. Anay Shah (03:28:18): And this impact is not continuous, right, because these data centers ebb and flow in terms of how much power they are consuming. So it's important to look at these peak moments. We found public satellite data from NASA and the European Space Agency that shows that, on average, nitrogen dioxide concentration increased by 3% when comparing for a year before in this area. But in the times of peak consumption, we're talking about a 79% increase in nitrogen dioxide concentration from pre-XAI levels in that area. So you can imagine it's like sitting in a traffic jam, and those moments have outsized impact on the community at that moment in time. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:29:00): Yeah. And so there's been a lot of pushback from this pollution and health risk standpoint. It's hitting South Memphis neighborhoods that already have elevated asthma and cancer rates from past industrial waste. This temporary electricity generation infrastructure isn't going to sustain in the long term. So all of this is kind of a case study in both the local impacts and also the time-to-power issue. Anay Shah (03:29:24): And this notion of time to power, essentially what it means is there is enough demand to get these data centers online quickly. The companies are willing to pay more and more. So when you have that kind of economic pressure, the community resistance sometimes can only go so far. As we're seeing in this case, XAI, despite the pressures, is currently building out a second location a few miles away, which will be double the size. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:29:50): Of the first: half a million of these GPUs. Anay Shah (03:29:53): I mean, just insane. That's the current moment we're living in. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:29:59): So far we've been trying to keep it focused on what has been built more than what is proposed. But I think it's worth taking an extreme view on some of what's coming. Meta has announced their big long-term project, their big training center, the Hyperion project, located in Richland Parish, Louisiana. It's a $10 billion buildout, online by 2030. They'll have a few steps in between. The goal is for this to be a five-gigawatt canvas covering over 2,000 acres. Anay Shah (03:30:28): What is 2,000 acres? Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:30:29): Yeah. So a different way to visualize this is this data center is about the size of Lower Manhattan. It is at a scale that is kind of unfathomable, right? That we're going to build buildings of that scale in a few years here to power such a new technology. Anay Shah (03:30:48): That Louisiana project is a great example of what we are living, the step-change function that we are living through right now. This is the biggest tech infrastructure project since either the 1960s, the dawn of the computer age, or even the 1880s, the heyday of the railroad period. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:31:09): I think Nvidia is on pace to capture the highest share of market-wide capital spending since IBM peaked in their percentage of that in 1969. And so a lot of comparisons are being made to other past booms like the Gilded Age or the telco buildout. Anay Shah (03:31:25): And when you mentioned booms, obviously you end up thinking about busts, right? So we talked about the telecom boom of the 1990s, which contributed to the dot-com crash and a bust on fiber. You also look back at the 1870s and the huge railroad boom that led to a crash, and both of these pose the question of, like, did we overbuild? Are we outrunning our demand? In both of those cases, it's not that the CapEx spenders were wrong; they were just early. We saw this vividly in the fiber overbuild. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:32:00): Right. Anay Shah (03:32:01): By the year 2000, we were only using 3% of the fiber we had laid. But it was absolutely necessary to power the next couple decades. And that's what it looks like for AI is that there may be an overbuild in this moment, but the foundational nature of this technology suggests that it's going to get utilized. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:32:20): Yeah, I think there's such a rush here because the potential AI market creates this economic imperative to go and plug in as many GPUs as quickly as possible, and that will build the largest and smartest AI model, which will create a moat. I think there's an interesting question here, though, of what is the infrastructure? Because yes, we still use the railroad tracks and we still use the fiber, but remember that all the companies that were building the fiber and the ones that were on top of that, it was too early for them to capture that value. But what's in part different about this boom is how it's being funded now. Yes, there are VC dollars and other dollars going into it, but at least historically, and if you look at the major capital expense, it is these big companies we've spent the episode talking about — it is Amazon, Microsoft, Google buying from Nvidia. And they're using the fact that their business models have thrown off billions and billions of dollars every quarter to then go buy the chips and build this out. So there's a real kind of concentration in some of the buildout of the infrastructure. Anay Shah (03:33:20): Those previous boom-busts financed by the banks end up drawing in the rest of the economy. And while there are some private credit actors and venture capitalist actors, because it's largely financed by free cash flow of these private companies, a bust hurts them, which will drag down the stock market, but is hopefully insulating the rest of the capital providers that are not involved. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:33:43): There is supposedly now more private credit starting to come in to fund this, and that could create linkages to other parts of the system. We will see how that plays out. We've talked about the story of data centers up until present day. Let's zoom out for a second and talk about just where we are today from a sense of scale. Anay Shah (03:34:04): Let's start with the most basic question: How many data centers exist today? There are globally approximately 11,800 data centers worldwide. Now, of course, the counting of this gets nuanced when you think about the closets that still exist with servers as they did back in the day. But by and large, we're talking about independent construction. And the US is by far the largest with over 5,000 data centers, followed by Germany, the UK, China, and Canada. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:34:33): So the US has almost half the data centers. Wow. Anay Shah (03:34:36): Yeah, heavy concentration in the U.S. Obviously other countries are catching up. China is building very quickly. So this begs the question of who owns all of these 11,000 data centers and who's spending these hundreds of billions of dollars. And you can kind of think of it in four broad categories. That's representative of the US but also it fits globally. And so the first category are our friends, the colocation centers, the ones we've talked about: Equinix, Digital Realty, and others. There are about a dozen of these that are building 10 to 100 megawatt blocks in the US and around the world. The second category are the hyperscalers: the Facebooks, Amazons, Microsofts; you can add in Apple, Oracle in there. They account for almost half of global data center capacity, and they're the lion's share of new growth. But importantly, you still have thousands of private server rooms in banks and retail facilities and public institutions that are out there. So while large in count, they're relatively smaller in capacity, but today still make up about 35%. And finally, you've got legacy telcos that are still owning and operating data centers. Now the interesting thing about this is the trend, right? You're seeing enterprise and public sector data centers trending down, and new build increasingly going to hyperscalers and these purpose-built colocation facilities. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:35:54): So how much actual physical real estate space are all of these data centers taking up? This is like anything that gets into this level of detail. It can be hard to pull exact numbers, but one reasonable estimate is that maybe there's one and a half billion square feet globally in data center buildout. For context, if you took an average median US home of around 2,200 square feet, that's around 730,000 of those homes of square footage, or 28,000 football fields. Anay Shah (03:36:20): Importantly, including end zones. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:36:24): That feels like a big number. But for some comparison to some other infrastructure in our life: If you just took the U.S. interstate system, so this is, you know, I-5, I-90, the big interstates, just the asphalt of those interstates is 10 times the square footage. So let's talk about power. Anay Shah (03:36:40): Remember the impact of data centers on power: it's quite localized and concentrated to its physical location. But let's talk about it in a sense of scale. We mentioned that in the US it's about 4.5% of total electricity. That's roughly 17 million households' annual use. How can I conceive of that power? Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:36:59): Yeah, I think if you look at the electricity consumption of the city of New York, it's about three New Yorks to power all the data centers in the US. Or if you look at all data centers globally, it's about equivalent to the power consumption of the United Kingdom. If you look at other comparable industries, it's pretty close to the power consumption of the chemical industry or the primary metals industry. This is extracting iron ore and smelting aluminum. Anay Shah (03:37:26): Similarly, on the water question, there's a tremendous amount of nuance in how to aggregate total water consumption. But let's just do the average of the average. Let's take direct water for cooling, indirect water from the power generated for the plant, and get a sense of how much water this is using US data. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:37:45): Centers together consume about 250 million gallons of water per day. That's about a quarter of what the city of New York uses. Anay Shah (03:37:53): So we've talked about the space, the data centers, how many of them, who owns them, how is it being powered and cooled? What's actually inside of them? Let's think about the scale of the compute power. It's actually a little bit difficult to figure out what humanity's overall compute power is, but let's just say there are about 50 to 100 million servers globally. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:38:13): Yeah. And so, I think the best way to get at this was to go back to the electricity usage numbers and then look at how much compute power we get per unit of electricity. What's surprising here is that if you run the numbers, we've grown humanity's compute power around 40x over the last decade, but have only grown power consumption about two and a half times because we've gotten more efficient. And if you look at that new compute power that's come online, only around 10% of data centers are AI-focused today. Of course, that's a growing percentage. Anay Shah (03:38:45): So compute power is one part of what the data center is doing. Let's give a sense of the scale on storage. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:38:51): Yeah. So in the last decade, we've 3x to 4x total installed storage capacity to around 15 zettabytes. Anay Shah (03:38:57): And so we're speaking to a friend of the show, Byron, who made me understand the modern marvel of hard drives. So imagine the head of the hard drive is scaled up to the size of a Boeing 747. It's flying at 560 miles an hour, and it is about the thickness of one piece of paper above a football field. That hard drive head is reading and writing to every single blade of grass moving at 560 miles an hour. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:39:27): That is absolutely insane. And so we have all these hard drives and all this compute. Now they're connected via these submarine cables. How many of those do we have? Anay Shah (03:39:34): We have approximately 600 active submarine cables that are powering 99% of international usage on the internet. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:39:45): So in total, we're about 100 times the global bandwidth that we were a decade ago. And we've seen internet bandwidth continue to grow 25% year over year. Anay Shah (03:39:53): And so these numbers are today's snapshot. Now, there are a lot of projections out there of where growth is going to go over the next five years. It can get fairly outlandish, but suffice to say, growth is continuing to accelerate now and in the years to come. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:40:10): All right, well, we talked about Byron's plane reading and writing blades of grass. Now it's time to land our plane. Anay, let's do the themes. What did you realize bubbled up for you over the course of this research and conversation? Anay Shah (03:40:24): It's been a journey. I did not know a lot coming in and have learned way more about the ins and outs of data centers than I ever imagined. A few big things will continue to stick with me. One of the first books we read is called *Tubes*, and it's this nonfiction, nerdy detective story to discover where this thing called the internet lives. It turns out the cloud is quite physical, but even more interesting, it's strangely concentrated. The internet has almost infinite edges, but it's got a shockingly small number of centers and has been built in this hub-and-spoke structure. And so for me, that starts with May East, right? Ashburn, Virginia, home to 13% of global data capacity and has once carried north of 30% of the world's internet traffic. That is the undisputed capital of the internet. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:41:25): And it's so wild that that became the hub just by being the hub. There's just this center of gravity that spiraled on itself, a black hole of data center investment, almost by accident, right? Yeah. Anay Shah (03:41:38): The internet's structure is based on this mesh connectivity of global cities on coastal shores. It's Virginia, New York, D.C., London, Paris, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Seoul, Lagos, all connected by these 600 undersea cables that are literally powering the world's economy. And so I think about data centers that started off occupying closets, growing to whole floors, then buildings, then warehouses. And I start to think of the cloud as a building, as a factory, where a bit comes in, gets massaged, gets put together in the right way, and then it gets sent out to its destination, and it really brings the internet home. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:42:21): For me, this connects to one of my reflections, which is threaded through the invisibility of this infrastructure and what makes data centers and the connecting internet almost the perfect abstracted infrastructure. And what I mean by that is you can access them, you can use them, you can get all of the power of them without ever seeing them or touching them. Now, with us living in a mostly wirelessly blanketed internet ourselves, you have access to all of these warehouses and all these buildings via all these undersea cables. And if you're an engineer developing software, you can deploy to all these regions around the world and never actually look at a CPU or a hard drive in your life. It is, I think, the best-abstracted physical infrastructure that humanity has built. It is physical, it is silicon, it is electricity, it is fiber. There is no real magic. It is all physics. But the only infrastructure I can think of in humanity that is as well abstracted is maybe money, but money is actually not physical anymore. In the same way, this actually is still doing physical work. And that struck me. Anay Shah (03:43:34): It does. It feels very rare to have global infrastructure that is defining our life and how the world operates, to be so. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:43:44): Invisible, and so frequently in our life. Even though it is invisible, our entire day is mediated by this infrastructure. But if your entire day is spent on the train, you're very aware of where the tracks are, and you can see them, and you're on the train. That's the engine, right? Anay Shah (03:44:01): Even fire, we probably used it selectively throughout the day. The railroads, we got on and off. The car, we got in and out of. Electricity, we turned the lights on and off. This is a modern marvel that we're only not using when we sleep. And even then, it's doing stuff for us. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:44:20): It's tracking my sleep. I'm wearing a ring that's tracking my sleep, sending bits to Oura's servers. Yeah, as you were saying that, it's like you're getting on and off a train. You're kind of turning electricity on and off in a transactional moment. This is almost more like you're living in it, right? You're living in this infrastructure, but we never see it. Anay Shah (03:44:44): I just had a flash of *Ready Player One*. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:44:46): Yes. Anay Shah (03:44:47): Putting on the full suit and immersing myself in another reality. We're close, when you think about it this way. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:44:54): I think that's right. I think this gets to one of my other realizations when comparing this to other physical infrastructure, which is, despite it being truly physical—buildings and silicon and electricity—we are upgrading it continuously and rapidly. Part of that is because of Moore's Law. Part of that is because of the improvement of the hardware and our techniques for cooling and all of these things. But I feel that with most other infrastructure, you get to, "Okay, this is a reasonably good way to build a train track. Now we need to go build more of it," or, "This is a reasonably good way to transport electricity. So now we're going to build more transmission." And certainly you get a little bit better at transmission, but we don't just get a little bit better here. We're getting 40x better. In the last decade, which was off the previous decade, it's gotten much better. So it's this weird thing where, yes, it's infrastructure, but it is changing what it is. We're getting at such an order of magnitude scale so quickly. And I can't think of other analogies to that. Maybe the first 20, 30 years of electricity felt like this, but this feels... something feels even more drastic here because what is being delivered is not commoditized exactly the same way as electricity. Anay Shah (03:46:02): That sense of movement that you're describing reminds me of another one of my takeaways, which is where I'm feeling stuck. And that's on the question of power. To me, it's easy to think about the complexities of why the power problem is so hard to solve, and yet the answers are right in front of us. The problem is huge, right? Data centers are pulling more and more electricity from the grid. The problem is hard because the grid is strained, the turbines and transformers are backlogged, and we don't really have utilities that are built to capture the incentive structures to value what hyperscalers are willing to pay today. And it's going to take years to reform the grid to actually meet the needs. And at the same time, the fastest, cheapest energy is available today. It's solar, storage, putting renewable energy online quickly and cheaply. That is already accounting for 90% of new capacity going on the grid. Despite every effort from our current administration to execute an ideological war on clean power and claim that we're in some national energy emergency, and yet deny the grid affordable electrons being placed on it. So if we can just get out of our own way, we can put a lot of power on the grid fairly quickly. The other side of that story is the way we're building data centers: accounting for 24/7 peak load. And there's a famous study that circulated earlier this year from Duke University that suggested that if we can limit grid-facing power of data centers by just 1% a year—90 hours out of the entire year—we can unlock 100 gigawatts of load. We can unlock the equivalent of two nuclear fleets on the US energy grid. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:47:54): Right. You saw Google do some recent announcements where they're collaborating with some of the utility providers to do exactly that. There are new startups that we see all the time that are building businesses around that concept. This connects really closely to my major takeaway on the power story, which is that limitations drive innovation, especially when they come up against a legacy incumbent system—something that generally works, and reasonably well. Which for all of our general disgruntledness about utilities in our life, it is phenomenal that the electricity works most of the time as well as it does. And it has not gotten a kick in the behind in a long time in terms of needing to try and evolve. There have been decades of people talking about a smarter grid, but nothing's forced the need like the AI data center competition and the geopolitical competition with China, which drives innovation across the stack. It's exactly what you're saying in terms of driving the next cheap, clean electron on the grid in the forms of renewable energy. But it's also pushing us on transmission and permitting, and it's also pushing us inside the data center to think even further about AI models. And we've invested in companies that improve the efficiency of actually running and training the model. Anay Shah (03:49:12): That's right. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:49:12): And so up and down this whole stack, a point we found again from talking to people and from research, these types of crunches drive efficiency innovation and the evolution of the grid. Anay Shah (03:49:24): And arguably, according to folks who have been in this for decades, we've been fairly lazy on innovation. It's been a lot of low-hanging fruit. And so this type of forcing function can drive step-change improvements in something as complicated as our national grid. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:49:41): So to me, all of that points to long-term optimism: first, in solving the problems, but second, in solving them in a way that leads to more clean energy deployment. However, it also means needing to recognize and not dismiss the near-term local impacts for both power and water in these environments. Anay Shah (03:50:01): I love that point because as we talked through these stories, that theme kept recurring of how it is different when you think about the problem locally than when you think about the problem nationally. And I think that's really important for people to understand as this is more and more headline news. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:50:16): My personal takeaway is less and less anxiety about that next incremental Gemini Query, ChatGPT, Anthropic use case or storing a video, and a greater desire to have more awareness locally within a given county that's struggling with air quality or water shortages. Because that's where activism needs to center within communities in the moment, rather than trying to slow the valuable uses and progress that we're all building toward. Anay Shah (03:50:45): Absolutely. This point on communities and geography and where things are located brings up another takeaway that's close to my heart as a former international politics major and someone who spent 20 years living and working across emerging markets. And that's the geopolitical implications of the moment we're living through right now. And so we talked a little bit about this, but to me, it really crystallizes into a twofold idea: One is the notion that we're living through this chip war, right? That microchips have replaced oil as one of the world's most critical resources and it's a key determinant of economic and military power. And we're in a new Cold War. This time, it's largely with China. As Americans, we don't want a country like China accessing our data or having superior performance over us. And so we're actively preventing US companies from selling chips to China. But it's not so straightforward, right? Because you think of, "Okay, Nvidia as an American company, we can prevent that." But Nvidia is the architect of the chips, right? The manufacturer of over 90% of the world's advanced chips is a Taiwanese company, TSMC, and they're the ones actually constructing it. So this geopolitical tension has various layers to it, but the notion that we're living through a new Cold War and the chip is the center of that story is quite striking. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:52:07): I think in the long term, or mid to long term, this type of technology is a genie that can't be put back into the bottle. China, in particular, is hyper-aware of what they want to domestically build for themselves here and actually is in a great position from a supply chain perspective to pull that off. Even if they're a couple years behind. You've seen them spin up AI labs, spin up their own domestic chip manufacturing, and do impressive jobs. And you can say, "Well, 18 months ahead," but what is that in the scale of this foundational technology? Anay Shah (03:52:40): Yeah, 18 months is a blink of an eye. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:52:42): I lean again toward long-term optimism that this competition creates good incentives for us to rethink our fundamental constraints, which are mostly on the clean energy deployment side. One big thing China has going for it that we don't have is its ability to grow generation of clean energy much, much faster than we do in the US. Again, because of their solar panel supply chain, their battery supply chain. Anay Shah (03:53:07): Their government structure, their ability to build, is unmatched. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:53:11): And so this is giving a lot of our structures a kick to rethink what's slowing us down. If this is so existentially important to stay at least on par, if not ahead on. Anay Shah (03:53:22): I agree strongly. In this notion of the chip war, I think it's interesting. In this moment, I think over the medium to long term, it's less. So here's where I don't share as much optimism: the AI boom and data center build-out that's potentially creating a new digital divide, exacerbating global inequality on yet another dimension. So we've talked about how US hyperscalers run almost 50% of data center compute. The U.S., China, and the European Union host more than half of all powerful data centers. What does that mean for the billions of other people living around the world? And what is the implication for a country that is renting compute power from a faraway data center? It's potentially higher costs, slower connection speeds, and compliance to different laws. But more importantly, as we unpack this—as we're trying to wrestle with this idea—it's this question of having a critical national security and economic infrastructure input owned, operated, and housed outside of your control. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:54:28): The techno-optimist in me is just screaming to refute this, and I'll tell you why. And I think we can study the internet as an example. This feeds into, I think, another meta theme for us, which is that these companies are the modern-day utilities, but they're actually the opposite in a way of the governing structure of an electricity utility, which is hyper-localized and granted local monopoly. These are global utilities. They're providing much more non-commodity functionality, everything down to a bespoke AI model that they're training, down to more commodity storage. And the business model of a utility is to, as we've seen again and again, provide more as cheaply as possible to as many customers as possible. And you've seen the biggest internet companies grow by incentivizing and subsidizing free services to more and more people. And that has led to a lot of the world getting connected that was not connected just 10 years ago. There's reason to be cynical about what Google and Meta are doing, trying to get more of the world connected. Don't they just want more customers? Obviously, yes, they want more customers. But in doing so, a lot more of the world has access to the internet than ever before, and information and knowledge. And I think that's where I fall on the side of optimism: that there's nothing more that OpenAI wants than more people having access to OpenAI. Now, that to me goes to the individual human level, which is very different than how a nation-state or the government in control of a nation-state might feel about it. But I lean on the individual human in a global context, and what powers I want them and their children to have in the decades to come. And that's where I get a source of optimism. Anay Shah (03:56:07): I mean, it's true. Sixty-six-plus percent of the world's population is now connected to the internet, and that number is increasing. I like the optimism. I wonder if the nature of this technology, particularly AI compute power, functions differently than access to the internet, access to electricity, and access to other similar infrastructures—having that controlled by private equity and public companies that have very specific incentive structures. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:56:39): I think there's a big thing that you just hit on for me, which is my optimism doesn't really account for the hosting government of hyperscalers. And so it's not just that these are companies, but they're American companies. If they're American companies, they exist a little bit at the pleasure of the American government. And that means that another country's access to them exists at the pleasure of the American government. And that, I think, gets to a more complex nuance, and to me, it just drives value to the idea of more global models and more global competition, even if it's not hosted within a given country, so that it's not just one or two governments that have control over these technologies. Anay Shah (03:57:22): More models trained on different languages, of course, and different speech patterns. And so, how this unregulated utility—as we're talking about, this new digital utility, this new critical infrastructure that society will increasingly depend on—will continue to be seen as a public good and delivered to more and more people as that... You know, they say hindsight is 20/20, but there's something even more interesting about creating a historical narrative to something like data centers. And it's the marvel of the narrative process, this story, that starts to make so much sense of how one thing came after another. So you start off with IBM and Watson's journey and the introduction of the punch card that is storing data, and then the machines that start to compute off that storage, and that grows and evolves. And you've got the Cold War introducing the need for connecting networks, and suddenly you've got compute and storage power. Network connections bring that together, and that continues to evolve. And then you get the explosion of the '90s. And in this time, first slightly accidental and then more purposeful infrastructure starts to get built in very important nodes, and the fiber boom happens. I think I'll now always associate the late '90s with the overbuild of fiber and this notion that by the time the dot-com bust happened, we only used 3% of the fiber that we built. It's wild. And yet that was exactly what we needed to go through the run-up of the 2000s and the growth of consumer and enterprise internet, mobile, and streaming, and then eventually the cloud. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:59:10): And then you had crypto creating this market for the AI chips before we had the models. Cycles of building ahead of the curve, there being some bust, but then there being this new utilization of those fundamental building blocks. Anay Shah (03:59:22): Absolutely. And these brilliant people located within very important companies that took the lead to build what is now foundational infrastructure for the world. Ben Shwab Eidelson (03:59:34): And then there's another dance that's happening—in where storage and compute lives for the average consumer or average business—where you go from it being all on the mainframe. Then it moves eventually to the PC. And you feel so powerful with your PC, but you have no collaboration, no backup, no redundancy. Then it moves back to the server room. Then in the mobile era, your connection is really slow. Early days, you think about the first iPhone: it was a really slow edge connection. So your phone actually had to do most of the stuff on the phone. But now we live in this world where the connection's back, fat, and happy. And so we do everything now on the server except for rendering the UI on the phone. And so this dance—of where both compute and storage happens, mediated by the communication bandwidth—is a really interesting dance that I see played out in the story. Anay Shah (04:00:26): That dance then drove the cloud boom of the 2010s and the maturing of enterprise cloud and infrastructure, where now you're able to do everything you want at higher and higher utilization in the cloud. And all of that build-out, and that fine-tuning and optimization, allowed us to enter March of 2020—the dark days of the beginning of the pandemic—and switch over from in-person to online from the perspective of the internet, largely without much of a hiccup. Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:01:04): Yeah, going to slightly lower resolution Netflix videos for a month. I think we handled it pretty well from a technology infrastructure perspective. Anay Shah (04:01:13): Correct. And how that just so happened to juice the infrastructure even more, to lay the foundation for GPUs to finally be utilized for what was growing in the background: machine learning and large language model training. And then November of 2022, putting a chatbot on top of a model, and the AI boom and the infrastructure that was laid to capture that moment, and the cash coffers of the hyperscalers that were ready to meet that moment, are now propelling the greatest technological infrastructure build-out in human history. What a story. Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:01:59): Yeah. Do you think it's an overbuild? Anay Shah (04:02:02): There are things that I worry about in this world, as we noted from the geopolitical situation, but once I strap in, the optimist in me takes over. So I am fully convinced that we will utilize every photon, electron, and square footage. I hope that this is the opportunity where we collectively can seize the moment to get more clean, firm power online, more affordable power online, and where we can use technology and renewable power to reduce the depletion of water resources in critical areas. The opportunity to build a newly-skilled workforce to build out this new infrastructure. The opportunity to modernize our aging grid, our transmission lines, the way we do siting and permitting, the way we do environmental review processes, the way utilities are incentivized to meet demand. The opportunity to spur local economic development in communities all over the country, and in the world. The opportunity to have large enterprises build out infrastructure that will be a net benefit to the consumer where they're locating their assets. And I think it's really important for us to be mindful of the cost of moving so quickly and not thinking through the implications of water, power, climate, communities, and global equity. And my real hope is that when you have this much capital and this much demand coming on to reshape a foundational technological infrastructure, we come out the other end with an ability to—as one of our new friends that we interviewed said—build these assets as ecologically invisible as possible. I think we have the opportunity to do that. And when we come out the other end having done that, I think our children's generation will look more kindly on us. --- Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:04:04): I think so, yeah. My big takeaway is that, of all the things we might study on this show, this one feels like the major piece of infrastructure that we're living in the middle of the step change. We are in the sharp part of the curve that's going up. This level of capital investment and build-out is what it looked like if you were to put yourself back into the initial build-out of the electricity grid or the railroad system, but further compressed. What's so interesting about that is you get to experience personally how quickly you adapt to amazing infrastructure and power—how quickly we've adapted, I think, to having the latest large language models at our fingertips. Now I have Claude Code, and I'm a few weeks into using that. I have what feels like new powers, but I'm kind of getting used to it again. We lived through most of this story and have vivid memories. Like, I remember Blockbuster, and I remember when Netflix was a DVD rental service. That was because it was too expensive to move streaming video at that scale, and now it's blindingly cheap. The business model changes; the products completely change. We are living through this cycle of infrastructure iteration and evolution at a pace that's rapidly changing what we can do with it. I don't know when we'll again get to the upper step of that curve, but we are living in the step change, and I'm just trying to relish that experience. Anay Shah (04:05:35): The rocket ship is in takeoff, feeling some G-forces. That's right. Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:05:39): But you get used to it, don't you? Anay Shah (04:05:41): Very quickly. Shockingly fast. I mean, even since we launched the fund two years ago to now, our workflows have changed dramatically. Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:05:53): That's right. Anay Shah (04:05:54): Despite the fact that you and I continue to look at each other 12 hours a day in the same screen. Yeah, yeah. The normalization of humans is astounding. And then you start thinking about our kids and how they're growing up in... Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:06:06): This moment: speaking to ChatGPT, Santa Claus if they want, or making a game. My four-year-old programmed a game that runs in JavaScript by telling Claude what he wanted. Anay Shah (04:06:18): Amazing. Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:06:20): It is wild, wild times. Anay Shah (04:06:22): We are living through a step change moment. Thanks for listening. Hopefully you're that much more informed about the invisible infrastructure that's not so invisible in powering the modern world. Ben Shwab Eidelson (04:06:39): You know how you got this podcast into your ears? It's amazing. That's right. Anay Shah (04:06:43): If you enjoyed this and have friends or colleagues that you think may find the story of data centers valuable, please send it their way.

Title: AI’s Next Dividend Bonanza Is NOT Where You Think
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/09/17/ais-next-dividend-bonanza-is-not-where-you-think/

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. While Wall Street chases NVIDIA (NVDA), the real AI dividend story is unfolding in the sleepy insurance sector. These “boring” firms are quietly leveraging AI tools to slash costs, grow premiums, and—best of all—dish us bigger dividends. AI is spreading across the economy much faster than many expected. That means we need to move even faster to front-run that shift. We’ve already been hard at it. In July, we talked about our favorite dividend payer to grab as AI reworks farming. Few people realize it, but “ag” has a long history of leveraging tech. It’s a big reason why productivity per farm worker has shot up 16X since 1948. Then there’s small business—and our favorite 8.8%-paying business development company (BDC), which funds many of these “mom-and-pop” shops. You don’t hear much about it, but small biz is wildly optimistic as AI helps it solve one of its toughest challenges: finding skilled workers. So where to next? When most people think about AI in business, they think about annoying customer-service chatbots. But that’s just the public side, and only a small part of the story. The real AI “juice”—especially for insurers—is on the back end. Picture an AI app pulling data from a patient’s medical records, zipping through the underwriting process and delivering a quote in seconds. While that’s going on, another runs compliance checks. Claims? Send in a picture of your damaged car/house/business and your payout pops into your account in minutes. Absolute gold for customer retention. All of this is happening in insurance right now. And that’s just on the efficiency side. The growth story is where things get interesting, as salespeople use AI to zero in on leads and cross-sell products. One example, cited in a July 2025 report from research firm McKinsey & Co., is that an AI app could assess a new life-insurance customer and toss out a personalized package, including disability and critical-illness coverage. As I said, initiatives like these are driving real returns for insurers today. And according to a January 2024 report from McKinsey, insurers that prioritize tech, including AI, have delivered far bigger total shareholder returns (TSR) than firms in other sectors. The best part of all for us is that the public still sees insurers as stuffy pencil-pushers (the same type of outdated view that hovers over agriculture). Let’s dive into three insurers leading the way in AI, and likely to hand their savings (and profit growth) to us in the form of dividend hikes. They all have appeal, but to make things simple, I’ve ranked them from “worst to first.” Progressive (PGR) was already a leader in algo-driven insurance before AI came along. Through fictional salesperson “Flo,” it could deliver a competitive insurance quote for a car, home or even a boat in a few minutes. Fast-forward to today and Flo is, you guessed it, a chatbot. Looking a bit deeper, the company is using AI to further refine Snapshot—its program that adapts rates based on real-time data from a customer’s car. It’s also using the tech to analyze photos of damage to speed up claims. Members of my Hidden Yields service will remember this one: We bagged an 87% return on it during our last holding period, from June 2019 to May 2023. PGR remains on my watch list, and we won’t hesitate to jump back into this savvy dividend payer (whose 0.16% yield masks the fact that it pays most of its dividend as a year-end special payout—often a big one). But with the stock trading around 4.4-times book value, that time is not now. We’d also like to see more buybacks: PGR’s share count is about where it was 10 years ago. The Travelers Cos. (TRV) is a giant in insurance, offering everything from property to personal and business coverage. On the claims side, Travelers, like Progressive, uses AI to analyze images of property damage and speed payments to policyholders, often before a human ever sets foot on the site. That kind of speed gives TRV a much better shot at keeping customers happy—and hanging on to their business. On the growth side, the company has tools like Business Owner Policy 2.0, which speeds up underwriting, getting a quote into a new small business customer much faster than in “analog” days. According to the company, the process cuts the number of questions a potential new business client has to answer by 70%, from around 40 to roughly nine. Moves like these are rocket fuel for a business that’s already firing on all cylinders. In the second quarter, TRV saw its catastrophe losses drop from $1.5 billion a year ago to $927 million. Written premiums jumped 4% and net investment income jumped 6%. That last number is particularly impressive since an insurer’s “float”—made up of total premiums collected—has to be placed in safer investments. Management loves its shareholders, too: Over the last decade, Travelers bought back 26% of its shares and hiked its payout 80%. That’s driven the share price up a stout 170%. With reinvested dividends, that return jumps to 237%! The only drawback? We like to buy a stock when the share price lags its “Dividend Magnet”—a true sign of value—and that’s not the case here. That’s why we’re putting this “stealth” AI dividend play on our watch list, instead of our buy list. Meantime, the AI focus at American International Group (AIG) is solidly on underwriting. The company has teamed up with Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Anthropic to develop AI tools that supercharge its human underwriters. Through these deals, it aims to help its underwriters process 500,000 E&S submissions in 2030, generating at least $4 billion in new business premiums. (E&S covers risks that don’t fit neatly in the silos of other kinds of coverage.) To put that in context, AIG generates about $28 billion in revenue a year. AIG also plans to create a “digital twin,” kind of a virtual mock-up of itself management can use to see what various decisions could have on the business. It’s on the dividend front that AIG gets really interesting. It yields 2.3% today and, following a long, stale period stretching back to 2016, it has recently sprung back to life. Management hasn’t been leaving investors out in the cold, though—it’s been busy buying back its ultra-cheap stock. That includes a massive repurchase of 56% of its shares outstanding in the last decade. Better still, it’s been accelerating those payouts just as it’s reawakened its dividend: Normally we don’t like to see a company buy more of its stock as it’s rising, as is the case here. But AIG’s reasonable valuation of around book value is backed up by its share price, which still lags the dividend. An AI-powered efficiency boost would only add to the stock’s momentum.

Title: China Bans Top Tech Firms From Buying Nvidia Chips, Report Says

Time Published: 2025-09-17T15:13:01Z

China has reportedly banned its largest tech firms from buying Nvidia (NVDA) AI chips, adding pressure on the U.S. chipmaker’s sales in the country. Shares of Nvidia, which entered Wednesday's session up roughly a third this year, fell about 3% in recent trading following the news. The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s internet regulator, told firms including TikTok owner ByteDance and e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) this week to end their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D—the chip Nvidia introduced in July for the Chinese market, according to the Financial Times. Beijing had concluded that homegrown chips are now performing on par with the Nvidia chips allowed in China under export controls, the FT said, citing people familiar with the matter. ByteDance and Alibaba did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication. The FT report said the companies that started testing and verification work on the chip with Nvidia's server suppliers have since told their suppliers to stop the work. The new ban is stronger than prior guidance from regulators that focused on curbing use of the H20, an earlier version of Nvidia's China-tailored AI chip, and comes after China recently accused Nvidia of antitrust violations. Asked at a press conference in London about the reported ban, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he was "disappointed." Huang is among U.S. tech executives accompanying President Donald Trump on a state visit to the U.K. "We can only be in service of a market if a country wants us to be,” Huang said, according to a transcript provided to Investopedia by the company. “I’m disappointed with what I see but they have larger agendas to work out between China and the United States. And I’m patient about it. We’ll continue to be supportive of the Chinese [government] and Chinese companies as they wish.” Nvidia faces U.S. export restrictions on sales of its most advanced chips to China and has tailor-made some of its semiconductors for the country's market. In August, Trump ended H20 restrictions his administration had placed earlier earlier in the year in exchange for a 15% share of revenues.

Title: Today in Apple history: Apple stock smashes through $700 barrier

Time Published: 2025-09-17T14:48:43Z

By Luke Dormehl • 7:48 am, September 17, 2025 September 17, 2012: On the back of record iPhone 5 preorders of 2 million in 24 hours, Apple’s stock price hits a new all-time high. For the first time in history, AAPL breaks the $700 mark in after-hours trading. Passing the milestone cements Cupertino’s place as the world’s most valuable publicly traded company. Amazingly, the new record is $270 a share higher than at the start of the year. Apple stock rose 65% in just nine months. By any measurable metric, Apple enjoyed soaring success in 2012. A stock price breaking $700 was just the latest in a series of dizzying records the company set in a few short years. In January 2006, Apple surpassed the value of Dell, the company whose founder once said he’d shut down Apple and refund its shareholders. A few years later, Apple overtook Microsoft — besting the tech giant that dominated the 1990s. In August 2011, Apple briefly overtook ExxonMobil to become the world’s most valuable company. And Apple’s stock price just kept climbing from there. At the end of February 2012, Apple surpassed the $500 billion market cap, then smashed through $600 billion in April. By September 2012, Apple was valued at upward of $650 billion. To put that in perspective, Apple was worth more than second-place ExxonMobil plus the entire net worth of Google at the time. Not bad for a company that had fallen to $12.88 a share on September 29, 2000. Apple hasn’t exactly renounced its winning ways since then. It became the first publicly traded U.S. company to pass the $800 billion, $900 billion, $1 trillion, $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion valuations. In early 2022, it surged past the $3 trillion line briefly before dropping amid a wider market pull-back. And it did the same thing in mid-2023. (Phew!) At the time of writing, AAPL is trading at around $240 a share. However, it’s not fair to compare this stock price with Apple’s $700 milestone from 2012, due to a 7-to-1 stock split in 2014 and a subsequent 4-to-1 split in 2020. As the stock prices of some AI-focused companies surged in recent years, Nvidia and Microsoft surpassed Apple’s market valuation. Currently, Apple’s market cap sits at $3.554 trillion, making it the third most valuable publicly traded company in the world, with Google’s parent Alphabet, Amazon and Meta hot on its heels.

Title: Has Elon Musk really been awarded a $1 trillion pay deal?

And why has the South African entrepreneur been busy buying up shares in Tesla? By Alex Kozul-Wright Share Save Tesla shares jumped 6 percent on Monday after CEO Elon Musk disclosed that he had bought $1bn worth of the company’s stock. The move reinforces Musk’s push for greater control over Tesla and comes a week after the company’s board offered him a $1 trillion pay package over the next decade. Musk’s stock purchase – his first open-market buy-up of shares since 2020 – comes at a critical time for Tesla, as it races to transform into an artificial intelligence and robotics firm whilst also grappling with falling sales of electric vehicles (EVs). But Musk’s pay packet has come in for intense criticism. Last weekend, Pope Leo decried the widening pay gap between corporate bosses such as Elon Musk – whose estimated wealth now stands at $367bn – and ordinary working people, which he said was a major factor in growing global unrest. On September 12, Musk, 54, purchased 2.57 million shares (which represents less than one percent of Tesla’s market capitalisation), paying between $372 and $397 per share as the price varied through the day, according to regulatory filings. He now owns almost 20 percent of Tesla, which seemingly pleases its investors. Tesla’s share price rose to around $422 on Monday – still 12 percent lower than its all-time high of $479 (reached in December 2024). Following his recent move, Musk posted on X that the increase in Tesla’s value was “foretold in the prophecy”. While Musk wasn’t an original founder of Tesla – he invested in the company one year after it was established – he became chairman in 2004. The South African entrepreneur has consistently demanded a bigger stake and more voting power at Tesla, having previously said he would prefer to build AI products and robots outside of Tesla if he cannot control 25 percent voting power in the firm. Musk sold more than $20bn of Tesla’s stock (or 4.6 percent of its market cap) in 2022 to fund his acquisition of Twitter, now X, for $44bn. He also owns private holdings in SpaceX, Neuralink and The Boring Company. The Tesla CEO will have to meet certain performance-related criteria first. To unlock the full $1 trillion payout, Musk will have to raise the company’s valuation from roughly $1 trillion today to $8.5 trillion over the next 10 years. He will also have to sell one million autonomous taxis and one million robots and increase Tesla’s profits by more than 24 times what it earned last year. Tesla currently operates a few dozen autonomous taxis in a limited area in the city where it is headquartered, Austin, Texas in the US. Known as “robotaxis“, they are self-driving vehicles but are accompanied by human “safety supervisors”, who can intervene if problems occur. On the robotics side, the company unveiled its first humanoid robot – Optimus – in 2022. In 2024, Musk claimed that Tesla would deploy robots for “internal use [ie for use inside its own factories]” in 2025, and that it would have produced 5,000 units by then. Neither pledge has been met so far. Musk also recently said that “80 percent of Tesla’s [future] value will be Optimus”. After Musk joined Tesla in 2004, he took very little cash pay. Instead, he chose to be paid in equity. Then, in 2018, shareholders approved a landmark 10-year pay package for Musk – linked to various operational targets – estimated at $2.6bn. As Tesla’s market value surged after the start of 2020 (when it was trading at just $29.50 a share), many of those pay objectives were met, and Musk received a large number of additional Tesla shares. Due to broad stock market gains since the COVID-19 pandemic, Musk’s earnings are estimated to have climbed by $40bn-$60bn. Though Musk’s pay windfall at Tesla has attracted regulatory scrutiny for overcompensation, especially from Delaware’s Court of Chancery, most of the company’s shareholders have repeatedly ratified the CEO’s payment packages. Tesla doesn’t disclose non-executive salaries, so it is hard to say how Musk’s income compares to that of the average worker there. However, corporate pay in the US has generally rallied in recent decades compared to that of workers. According to the Economic Policy Institute, average pay for CEOs at S&P 500 companies – the 500 biggest listed firms in the US – rose by almost 1,000 percent over the 50-year period leading up to 2024. By contrast, a typical worker at an S&P 500 company has seen his or her pay packet rise by just 27 percent (adjusted for inflation) over the same period. Stated differently, the CEO-to-worker pay ratio has increased from 30:1 to 350:1 over the past five decades. In an interview last week with Crux, a Catholic news website, Pope Leo singled out Elon Musk as an example of the kind of wealth he said was corroding “the value of human life, of the family, of the value of society”. Asked about Tesla’s proposed $1 trillion pay packet, Leo responded: “What does that mean, and what’s that about? If [personal wealth accumulation] is the only thing that has any value any more, then we are in big trouble.” Despite its recent uptick, so far this year, Tesla’s stock market performance has been among the worst of the “Magnificent 7” group of tech giants – which also includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia – having lost around 2 percent of its value this year so far. Tesla’s most recent quarterly results showed profit losses amid falling demand for electric vehicles and increased import production costs associated with US President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs. Looking ahead, earnings look set to continue falling. Sales of Tesla cars in the US will likely fall further in the last three months of 2025, as Trump has refused to extend a tax credit for EV purchases for US consumers after October. Up to now, the rebate has played a crucial role in making American EVs more affordable. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: Rocket Lab: How Low Can RKLB Stock Really Go?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/17/rocket-lab-how-low-can-rklb-stock-really-go/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rocket Lab’s stock (NASDAQ: RKLB) trended lower following the company's announcement to raise $750 million through equity dilution. This move, which increases the total number of shares, often concerns investors because it can negatively impact a company's earnings per share. The key question is the extent of the downside risk for RKLB stock. Despite its recent decline, the stock still appears overvalued. This overvaluation, combined with the stock’s history of only modest rebounds after previous drops, suggests there is considerable risk. Consider the following information: While we prefer to purchase dips if the fundamentals are solid – for RKLB, see Buy or Sell RKLB Stock – we are cautious of falling knives. Specifically, it is crucial to determine if the situation deteriorates significantly, leading to an additional drop of 20-30% to the $33 level, and whether we will be able to retain the stock. What is the worst-case scenario? We refer to this as downturn resilience. Below is an in-depth analysis of Rocket Lab’s downturn resilience – particularly, its performance in comparison to the market during previous crises. It turns out that the stock experienced an impact that was slightly better than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We evaluate this based on (a) the extent to which the stock fell and (b) how swiftly it recovered. Below are the specifics, but before that, as a brief background: RKLB offers launch services, small orbital vehicles, and satellite platforms for commercial, aerospace, and government space and defense sectors. Overall, Rocket Lab (RKLB) stock has a history of experiencing significant declines during broader market corrections. While the company has generated investor interest through its successful rocket launches and new contracts—especially for its upcoming Neutron rocket—investors should also be mindful of the potential downside risk. Concerned that RKLB may decline further? You may want to explore the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which includes a selection of 30 stocks that have historically comfortably outperformed its benchmark, which comprises the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What is the reason for this? Generally speaking, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; they offer a steadier ride, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Editor Crypto CoinDesk, Helene Braun The world’s largest asset manager is exploring putting exchange-traded funds on chain, sources told Bloomberg. BlackRock is exploring how to bring exchange-traded funds (ETFs) onto public blockchains, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The sources said the asset manager is weighing tokenizing funds tied to real-world assets such as stocks, though any rollout would depend on regulatory approval. The discussions follow BlackRock’s first experiment with tokenization last year. The firm introduced the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, also known as BUIDL. The fund, which is backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries, repurchase agreements and cash, has quickly grown into the world’s largest tokenized Treasury product, managing nearly $2.2 billion. Tokenizing ETFs would represent a deeper step into blockchain-based financial products. In practice, it would mean that shares of the funds — traditionally traded on stock exchanges during market hours — could be issued and transacted as tokens on chain. Proponents argue this shift could bring clear benefits. A tokenized ETF could be traded around the clock, rather than only during exchange hours. Settlement, which often takes two business days in traditional finance, could be completed within minutes. Investors in markets where ETFs are not easily accessible might gain exposure through blockchain rails. The products are pending a green light from regulators, the people said. BlackRock’s exploration underscores a wider trend across finance, as banks, fintechs and asset managers test blockchain rails for bonds, private credit and now mainstream equity funds.

Job seekers: Where are you looking for opportunities right now? There’s been plenty of coverage on the plight of those currently looking for a new job. From the falling hiring rates and increasing unemployment time—the average American now spends more than five months in between jobs, up from four in 2024—to the flood of AI-generated résumés that recruiters receive, applicants are having a tough time. Keeping your search to just one job board isn’t cutting it anymore. Now, OpenAI is tapping into the game. Earlier this month, the company announced plans to launch its own jobs platform next year. The platform “will have knowledgeable, experienced candidates at every level, and opportunities for anyone looking to put their skills to use,” according to a blog post from CEO of Applications Fidji Simo. It will also help small businesses find “AI talent” for specific needs. The tech giant is also getting in on the certifications industry, which made $6.4 billion in revenue last year, according to IBIS world. OpenAI’s options will include certifications from intro-level all the way to advanced AI usage, such as prompt engineering. They’re not the first company to inject AI into the job search process. LinkedIn started incorporating the technology into users’ job searches in 2023. As of May, Premium users can ask LinkedIn’s AI to find personalized jobs through a chat. Companies like Coursera, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and even LinkedIn have long had their own “AI fluency” or “Intro to AI” certifications for workers looking for that extra badge. Still, for those struggling to land their next job, Forbes contributors have a few suggestions: For one, look at niche job boards, writes Bryan Robinson. It’s easy for people to spam LinkedIn postings with résumés and applications for jobs they’re not quite qualified for, causing some qualified candidates to get buried. By using lesser-known job boards like Wellfound, Otta or FlexJobs, your odds of getting a response could increase. And once you’ve scheduled an interview, you can use AI as your personal coach, suggests contributor Justin Sablich. Custom interview prompts, like using the STAR—situation, task, action, result—method or asking the model to act as an adversarial interviewer can help you go deeper with each question. But always be wary of the specific information you give the chatbot. Have any other tips on finding your perfect job in this new market, or questions over your own search? My inbox is always open. Hope you have a lovely week, and happy reading! Practical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter. Learn about the tell-tale signs of a toxic workplace you can find in job postings. These are five transferable skills that make switching careers way easier. This is how to get AI agents to help you do your work better. News from the world of work. We wrote last week that the United States added 911,000 fewer jobs than initially reported last year. But why was the revision so high? New businesses, reports Forbes’ Brandon Kochkodin, as well as an actual count of jobs added versus the initial survey estimate. Stanford holds the best MBA program this year, according to LinkedIn’s annual ranking of postgraduate programs. Cofounder, CEO and product manager are the most common titles to come out of the school. Real estate giant Brookfield declared the return-to-office debate “over” in its latest investor day presentation. The news comes as Microsoft employees will be required to be in the office three days a week starting in 2026.

Title: Waymo's robotaxi expansion will get a Lyft in Nashville next year

Robotaxi leader Waymo's driverless vehicles will begin transporting passengers in Nashville, Tennessee, next year with Lyft instead of its recent ride-hailing partner Uber Robotaxi leader Waymo on Wednesday announced that its driverless vehicles will begin transporting passengers in Nashville, Tennessee, next year while heading in a new direction by teaming up with Lyft instead of its recent ride-hailing partner Uber. The Nashville plan calls for robotaxi ride requests to initially be limited to Waymo's own mobile app before expanding on to Lyft's app later next year. Waymo's decision to work with Lyft in Tennessee's biggest city means its robotaxis will now be available on the apps of the two largest ride-hailing services in the U.S. As part of earlier expansions, Waymo is already dispatching robotaxis through Uber's app i n Atlanta and Austin, Texas. Electric automaker Tesla has been testing a limited driverless service in Austin in an attempt to fulfill an ambitious plan that CEO Elon Musk has been pursuing for the past decade. Even if it's in only one city, getting Waymo's industry-leading robotaxis on its app could help Lyft continue its recovery from the pandemic restrictions that decimated demand for rides. Uber bounced back from the pandemic more quickly, a comeback that has been reflected in both its financial results and market value, which has tripled since the end of 2019. Lyft's stock price, in contrast, remains about 50% below where it stood at the end of 2019. As part of its turnaround efforts, Lyft hired former Amazon executive David Risher as its CEO two years ago. Risher previously negotiated a partnership with May Mobility that is now providing driverless rides in Atlanta in competition with Waymo and Uber. This is not the first time that Waymo and Lyft have worked together. During the testing phase of its robotaxi service in Phoenix in 2019, Waymo offered a limited number of rides through Lyft. That arrangement ended after Waymo completed the Phoenix tests and began accepting driverless rides from all interested passengers on its own app more than five years ago. Since starting in Arizona, Waymo's robotaxis have provided more than 250,000 trips in cities from the San Francisco Bay Area to Los Angeles, as well as Austin and Atlanta. Waymo, which began in 2009 as a secret project within Google, also plans to expand into Dallas next year. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Over 166,000 tech jobs cut in 2025 so far

For most of Big Tech, 2025 has been a solid year financially — Intel being the notable exception. But for employees, job security feels increasingly fragile. According to an analysis by RationalFX, a total of 166,387 tech workers have been laid off so far in 2025. The report pulls information from U.S. WARN notices, job board TrueUp, TechCrunch, and the layoff tracker Layoffs.fyi. Intel tops the list. The struggling chipmaker plans to cut around 34,000 jobs this year as it tries to streamline operations and reset its strategy. Microsoft isn’t far behind. The Redmond-based giant has already gone through multiple rounds of layoffs: roughly 6,000 roles in April and another 9,000 in July, RationalFX foresees a total of at least 19,215 positions in 2025 eliminated in the name of efficiency. India’s Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) ranks third, with an estimated 12,000 employees let go this year, largely as part of cost-cutting measures and the rollout of AI-driven automation. Cuts haven’t stopped there. Almost every major player has made reductions: IBM is phasing out about 9,000 HR roles, shifting many of those responsibilities to AI. STMicroelectronics, the European chipmaker, is cutting 5,000 jobs. Salesforce shed 1,000 positions in February and another 4,000 in September. Meta has already let go of 3,720 staff this year, continuing a pattern from previous years. Amazon eliminated over 3,350 jobs, including through the closure of all its Canadian warehouses. Oracle laid off 3,000 workers in just the past two months. Even Elon Musk’s xAI joined the trend, dismissing 500 employees who had worked on training its chatbot Grok. AI itself is emerging as a major factor. Analysts estimate that roughly 37,702 of the layoffs this year were directly tied to automation and the adoption of AI tools that replaced human tasks outright. Looking ahead, RationalFX forecasts that total tech layoffs could climb to 235,000 by the end of 2025. RationalFX

Stock futures are little changed as investors get ready for today’s interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve, which is expected to lower rates for the first time this year; China has reportedly ordered firms to stop buying the latest Nvidia (NVDA) chip designed for that market; Meta Platforms (META) is expected to highlight its AI glasses at its developer event; and StubHub shares are set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are little changed ahead of today’s highly anticipated Federal Reserve decision on interest rates. Futures tied to the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq, which hit fresh all-time highs yesterday morning before finishing the day slightly lower, were down less than 0.1% this morning. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, ticked lower to 4.01%, near its lowest level since April. Gold futures were down slightly at around $3,700 an ounce, after hitting a record high on Tuesday, while bitcoin edged lower to $116,300. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower interest rates today, with the announcement coming at 2 p.m. ET today. While most investors believe the Fed will cut its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point, some are betting that a half-point cut is possible amid signs of weakness in the labor market. The Fed will also release its quarterly projections on the direction of the economy and interest rates. At 2:30 p.m. ET, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference to discuss the decision and speak on general economic conditions. Investors will be looking for signals that the Fed believes economic conditions warrant more rate cuts in the coming months. China’s internet regulator has ordered companies to stop buying Nvidia (NVDA) chips in order to reduce reliance on U.S. technology, according to a report in The Financial Times. The Cyberspace Administration of China told companies including TikTok-parent ByteDance and Alibaba to terminate their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D, Nvidia’s latest chip designed for the Chinese market, the report said. The new ban is stronger than prior restrictions from regulators that focused on the H20, an earlier version of Nvidia's China-tailored AI chip. The ban comes after China recently accused Nvidia of antitrust violations. Nvidia shares were down about 1% in recent premarket trading. Meta Platforms (META) is expected to show off its AI-powered smart glasses and other new technology at its developer conference that begins today. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who is scheduled to deliver the keynote address at 8 p.m. ET, is expected to showcase the company's "Hypernova" glasses. The launch of new Meta AI glasses comes as competitors Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and Amazon (AMZN) plan to launch their own versions of AI glasses. Meta shares were down slightly in premarket trading. Meta’s Connect conference will extend into Thursday. StubHub has raised $800 million from its initial public offering after pricing the deal at the midpoint of a marketed range, as the online ticketing reseller succeeds in its third attempt at going public. StubHub sold 34 million shares for $23.50 each, which values the online ticket reseller at around $8.8 billion. The stock is expected to begin trading today on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “STUB”. The IPO comes after StubHub delayed its own listing plans earlier this year amid market turmoil following President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements. StubHub’s listing follows similar public offerings in recent weeks, including buy now, pay later firm Klarna’s IPO last week.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg wowed Meta skeptics this time last year. He's about to try to do it again.

Meta's vision of AI-powered glasses as the next must-have device is about to face a major test. CEO Mark Zuckerberg set the bar high at Meta Connect in 2024 with the not-for-mass-market technology in its Orion glasses. Now he has to take the next step in marketable wearables — and get consumers to shell out. Zuckerberg is expected to take the stage at Meta's Menlo Park headquarters for the company's annual Meta Connect conference to lay out his vision for Meta glasses, headsets, and the future of contextual AI. The stakes are high. Meta is spending billions on AI research and hardware while competitors like Apple, OpenAI, and Google are chasing the same market. Meta Connect is Zuckerberg's chance to prove the company's sprawling investments in wearables, software, and AI are converging into something consumers would potentially pay more for. Last year, Zuckerberg generated major buzz with a prototype of the Orion glasses, Meta's first true attempt at fully holographic AR. He also laid out a vision of wider adoption of AI glasses. Though still a developer-only product, Orion impressed early testers, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Reddit's Steve Huffman. The demo also earned positive reviews from Business Insider's own Peter Kafka, who said he would "buy them in a heartbeat." At the event, Zuckerberg also rolled out updates to existing products, such as transparent Ray-Ban Meta frames, new celebrity voices for Meta AI, and a budget-friendly Quest 3S headset at $299. Meta's stock rose more than 2% during Zuckerberg's keynote, and the Ray-Ban smart glasses also became a hit, with sales surpassing 2 million units by early 2025. In May, Zuckerberg announced that Meta AI now has around 1 billion monthly active users across Meta's apps. Leaks and reports suggest Zuckerberg will use this year's keynote to shift focus from experimental prototypes to products that it hopes will be widely adopted. Orion is equipped with cutting-edge technology and costs $10,000 to produce per pair. Meta's test this year is whether it can release a stepping-stone product in terms of price point and capabilities, and whether Zuckerberg could convince consumers to pay more for a pair of glasses than the current Ray-Ban Meta model, which starts at $299. Here is what we might see: This year's Meta Connect event comes during an escalating talent war in Silicon Valley. Not including the billions that Reality Labs, the division behind AR/VR, has lost in 2025, Meta has been dangling multimillion-dollar compensation packages to lure AI researchers and hardware engineers, and it seems to be working. Earlier this year, the company launched Meta Superintelligence Labs under Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang. To bring Wang on board, Meta invested $14.8 billion in the startup for a 49% non-voting stake. In July, Meta lured away a co-creator of ChatGPT from OpenAI and appointed him chief scientist of its Superintelligence Labs. The company has also recruited three researchers behind OpenAI's Zurich office — Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov, and Xiaohua Zhai — who had spent time at Google's DeepMind. With all this AI talent and new hardware, Meta needs to wow consumers and Wall Street again. Jump to

Tech Layoffs in 2025 Already Top 166,000 Tech companies are facing another wave of massive layoffs, with over 166,000 jobs lost so far in 2025 and projections nearing 235,000. Industry giants like Intel and Microsoft lead the cuts, with AI increasingly replacing human roles in customer service and operations. When COVID-19 struck, many people lost their jobs. People stopped going out as much, and a number of businesses had to shut their doors for good. However, the tech space saw a boom. More people stayed home to work, which meant there was an increase in demand for digital products and services, leading to a hiring frenzy. This all came to a head once the pandemic passed. Now, it looks like layoffs at tech companies are happening again. According to a report from RationalFX, the tech companies are going through massive layoffs in 2025. The report claims that there have been about 166,000 layoffs globally in 2025 so far, and it is estimated to reach as many as 235,000 by the end of the year. This means on average, there are 645 jobs being lost a day since January 2025. The report also reveals which companies have been laying off the most workers. At the top of the list is Intel, with an estimated 33,900 layoffs. This doesn’t come as a surprise. Intel has been struggling as of late, no thanks in part to the rise of AI which has led to an increase in demand for chips from companies like NVIDIA. Intel has also been a bit slow on the mobile front, allowing TSMC and Qualcomm to dominate the scene. Plus, the controversies surrounding some of its CPUs in recent years haven’t done them any favors. Microsoft comes in second place at 19,215 layoffs. We’re also seeing around 9,000 layoffs at IBM, 5,000 at Salesforce, 3,720 at Meta, and 3,350 at Amazon. What’s worrying is that some of these layoffs might not necessarily have to do with companies performing badly. But rather, some of these companies have found that replacing human workers with AI might actually be better financially. The report revealed that companies such as Salesforce slashed its customer support workforce by about half. This is because AI agents were more than capable of doing those jobs. ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, also went through similar layoffs, thanks (or no thanks) to AI. IBM’s layoffs are also in part due to AI, where the company is looking to cut costs and streamline its operations. It is true that AI has the potential to take some of our jobs. Things like customer service makes sense. If AI can answer simple questions that customers have quickly and efficiently, why hire a human that might get it wrong? It is worrying, but that seems to be the direction we’re heading towards. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

80 applicants in less than 5-minutes show the high demand for affordable homes. Stock image Property prices rose in the 12 months to July this year, up 7.5pc compared to the same time a year ago, but the pace of increases has moderated. In the 12 months to the end of June, prices were up 7.9pc. The latest Central Statistics Office (CSO) data shows the greatest slowdown was in Dublin. House prices in the capital were 6pc higher at the end of July than a year earlier, versus up 6.8pc in the 12 months to the end of June. The CSO Residential Property Price Index shows property prices outside Dublin were 8.7pc higher in July 2025 when compared with a year earlier, a slight decrease, from 8.8pc in the year to June 2025. Dublin city prices were up 7.7pc at the end of July. In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, which has some of the highest average prices anywhere, the pace of increase has moderated significantly, with a rise of 4.7pc in 12 months. However, double-digit price hikes are still being felt outside Dublin. House prices in the Midlands (Laois, Longford, Offaly, and Westmeath) are up 10.9pc, and the Mid-West (Clare, Limerick, and Tipperary) they rose 10.3pc. Both the South-East, which comprises Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, and Wexford, and the South-West (Cork and Kerry) had an 8.1pc rise in house prices. 80 applicants in less than 5-minutes show the high demand for affordable homes. Stock image Today's News in 90 Seconds - September 17th Households paid an average price of €374,999 for a dwelling on the residential property market in the 12 months to July 2025, the CSO said. The region with the highest median price in the year to July was Dublin, with median prices of €490,000. Within Dublin, the most expensive area was Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, where the average price was €675,000. The least expensive region within Dublin was Fingal at price of €460,000. Outside of Dublin, the most expensive region over the last 12 months was Wicklow, with a median price of €451,000. The second most expensive region was Kildare, the CSO said. The least expensive regions over the last 12 months were both Donegal and Leitrim, where the standard price paid for a dwelling was €195,000. In the year to July, the Eircode area with the highest price for household dwelling purchases was A94 (Blackrock, Dublin), with an average price of €795,000. The Eircode area with the least expensive median price within Dublin was D10 (Dublin 10), where the median price was €314,000. Outside of Dublin, the most expensive Eircode area over the last 12 months was A98 (Bray, Wicklow), with a median price of €549,999. The least expensive Eircode area over the last 12 months was F45 (Castlerea, Roscommon), coming it at €150,000, the CSO said. The total value of dwelling purchases by households at market prices filed with Revenue was €2.1bn in July 2025, representing a 6.6pc increase compared with the €1.9bn worth of purchases in July 2024 and a 20.8pc increase compared with the €1.7bn worth of purchases in June 2025. “While the slight fall in the rate of annual house price growth will be welcomed by aspiring buyers, this is not unusual for the summer, often a quiet time for house sales,” said Trevor Grant, chairman of Irish Mortgage Advisors. “However, this easing could be short-lived and we could well see the rate of house price growth pick up for September and October, often busy months for house sales.” The price indices for new and existing dwellings are produced on a quarterly basis and at the national level only.

Title: Alphabet Rides The AI Wave Over The $3 Trillion Mark
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/technology/big-tech/alphabet-rides-the-ai-wave-over-the-3-trillion-mark/
Time Published: 2025-09-17T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Alphabet is the newest member of the $3 trillion club, and it’s counting on rolling AI ambitions to take it higher. Jamie Wilde Guest Contributor to The Daily Upside Tech giant Alphabet joined the $3 trillion club this week, making it the fourth company to reach that impressive market cap. Certainly, you’ve heard about the other three — Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia — but, if not, just Google them. A favorable ruling earlier this month in an antitrust case against Alphabet kickstarted the stock’s latest upward swing. A US court ruled the company didn’t need to sell off its Chrome browser or Android operating system, two outcomes investors feared would cut into the company’s core biz. Then there’s what pushed the stock over the top into $3 trillion territory: growing enthusiasm for Alphabet’s AI investments. Alphabet’s stock has climbed more than 70% from its April low. Its cloud-computing unit’s revenue surged a better-than-expected 32% in the second quarter, lifted by demand for new AI offerings like the Gemini chatbot from its Google subsidiary. Earlier this month, Google Cloud’s CEO said the company’s already made billions from AI and has $106 billion in customer demand for its cloud computing services. The success highlights Alphabet’s efforts to diversify beyond its advertising businesses, including at Google and YouTube, which make up more than half of revenue. And, following Google Cloud’s success, Alphabet’s bringing AI to more products: Surface Tension: Fears of the AI bubble bursting haven’t been realized, as investors continue to bet that massive investments into the tech will pay off. AI chip-maker Nvidia is still the most valuable company with a market cap of more than $4 trillion. And Oracle signed a $300 billion cloud deal with OpenAI last week, pouring fuel on its stock’s rally. If AI is a bubble, it seems to be made of something more durable than soapy water. Unfortunately for Intel, the deal does not provide a direct lifeline to its floundering chipmaking foundry business. Meta will likely soon face competition from Amazon, Alphabet, Snap and other tech firms with augmented-reality glasses in development. Quantum computers are expected to solve previously unsolvable problems (or ones that would take ages) across industries. Apple’s latest generation of iPhones were debuted with modest aplomb last week. Presales show the company has plenty to be confident about. Between 2000 and 2002, after the dot com bubble popped, the Nasdaq lost nearly 80% of its value, wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth. Oracle said its remaining performance obligations is now sitting at $455 billion. That’s up 359% from where it stood just a year ago. Mistral has been hailed by policymakers as key to Europe’s ambitions to compete with dominant US and Asian rivals. iPhone sales surged to $44.5 billion in the quarter ending in June, besting analysts’ $40 billion expectations and rising 14% year-over-year. Pubmatic’s lawsuit comes after a US Judge ruled in April that Google was maintaining an illegal monopoly in the ad tech industry. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, having successfully diversified into cloud computing, is now making a push into artificial intelligence. So far, Tesla has launched limited rideshare services in Austin and the Bay area, and it’s looking to expand into Florida, Arizona and Nevada. For a year now, Apple shareholders have feared the company would lose out on easy revenue from making Google its default search engine. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Annual property price growth slips to 16-month low - CSO
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/0917/1533940-cso-residential-property-prices/
Time Published: 2025-09-17T10:19:09Z

Eleanor Burnhill Dublin City Council has said it is working with the Department of Housing, the Land Development Agency and Approved Housing Bodies to build as many homes as possible for first-time buyers and those on the housing waiting list. Assistant CEO for Housing at DCC Mick Mulhern said the council is "working to deliver as many homes as possible in the quickest time frame possible" and is now working across 100 different sites to deliver 12 thousand homes, which he said could take a number of years. He said of the 169 new homes launched today at Rathborne Crossing close to Ashtown station, DCC would take 86 of those. "There'll be social houses in one and two beds as part of this new development, which also includes a new creche and amenity space." It comes as residential property price growth slipped to a 16-month low of 7.5% in July, down from 7.9% in June, new figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) show. The CSO said that property prices in Dublin rose by 6% in July and prices outside Dublin were up by 8.7% compared with the same month last year. Lord Mayor of Dublin Ray McAdam said there was a significant pipeline of development by Dublin City Council in terms of housing delivery taking place in the city at the present. "But obviously I fully acknowledge that we need to do more, and we are doing more." He said a decision would be taken before the end of this year in terms of reviewing who gets priority from the council's housing list. He said the Strategic Housing Policy Committee was looking at this. He acknowledged there were too many families and individuals experiencing homelessness and he said: "What we're working to do is to ensure that we ramp up supply, to ensure those, those families, have an opportunity to move in, into permanent accommodation." Reacting to the figures, the Minister for Housing James Browne said supply was key, but the Government was working to deliver as many homes as possible. "I'm very conscious that's a very significant increase. It is affecting affordability. "We need to get the apartments and the homes built. People need to be able to afford them, and that's why we're taking as many measures as we can. "But the key to getting house prices stabilised, and actually at an affordable price, is supply. That's why everything I've been doing for the first six months as Minister for Housing is making those key decisions, often difficult decisions, often decisions are being criticised, but they will actually deliver the supply that we need." In terms of numbers, he said there had never been a 50,000 target for delivery. "There won't be 50,000 this year, but it was never intended to be 50,000 homes this year. "What we want to see is an increase in the homes last year, and continue to build on the momentum that is there. In the last government we went from 19,000 homes to well over 30,000 homes actually in the lifetime of Housing For All, we actually exceeded the targets." 'Significant step change' - Browne Speaking today, Minister Browne said the government is starting from further behind this year in terms of delivering housing that would have been expected. He said he expected to see housing targets and delivery accelerate as the years go on but he would not be drawn on how many houses will be delivered by the end of this calendar year. "We accept there has to be a significant step change," he said. He said a little over 30,000 homes were delivered last year but the hope was that would have been higher. "That was a real disappointment and it does mean this year and in the near future we're probably starting from further behind what we would expect," he said. He said important decisions were being taken to accelerate delivery including making the country a national rent pressure zone, giving more security of tenure to tenants and what he hoped would be more certainty for international investors. "We need international finance to finance the construction sector in this country to deliver," he said. He said with the ebb and flow of construction, a few apartment blocks being completed in December, slipping into January could fundamentally change annual numbers. "I've never been in the business of forecasting but my business is to ensure we maximise every opportunity to deliver as many homes as possible." In terms of homelessness figures he said this was being looked at a granular level to look at the different reasons for it and trying to address those. Asked about a downturn in planning applications and comments from the Labour Party that he was seeking to blame local authorities for this, he said: "We've seen a 35% increase in building delivery in the second quarter. You're always going to have when you're dealing with something like building variations of commencements, planning, the delivery." He said he will keep an eye on looking at how more planning we can be accelerated working with the local authorities, ensuring they have the resources they need. "It also means having the land zoned that we need as well. "This is not about the blame game. This is about ensuring that we have the homes delivered where we need to build, the communities that everybody deserves," he said. Housing Activation office 'up and running' Minister Browne says the new Housing Activation Office will have a lead or a head, but will not have a housing 'tsar'. "All of the specialists from utility companies are now in place, and the specialists from the local authorities as well. "We are engaging with local authorities, writing out to them soon to identify the key areas. So that work is ongoing, and we will be identifying that lead. I don't give it any particular moniker, but it will have a lead, and we're making that final decision as to how exactly that would be implemented," he said. The CSO figures show that house prices in Dublin rose by 6.2% while apartment prices increased by 5.3%. The highest house price growth in Dublin was in Dublin City at 7.7% while Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown saw a rise of 4.7%. Outside Dublin, house prices were up by 8.7% and apartment prices rose by 7.5%. The region outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices was the Midlands (Laois, Longford, Offaly, and Westmeath) at 10.9%, while the South-East (Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, and Wexford) and the South-West (Cork and Kerry) both saw increases of 8.1%. The median price of a home bought in the 12 months to July 2025 was €374,99, the CSO added. Today's figures show that the highest median price for a home in the 12 months to July was €675,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest median price was €195,000 in both Donegal and Leitrim. Meanwhile, the most expensive Eircode area in July was A94 (Blackrock, Dublin) with a median price of €795,000, while F45 (Castlerea, Roscommon) had the lowest price of €150,000. Today's CSO figures also show that a total of 4,712 home purchases were filed with Revenue in July, a decrease of 0.2% when compared with the 4,723 purchases in July last year. The total value of transactions filed in July was €2.1 billion - made up of 3,567 existing homes with a value of €1.5 billion, and 1,145 new homes with a value of €550.7m. Today's figures mean that Dublin residential property prices are 6.8% higher than their February 2007 peak, while residential property prices in the Rest of Ireland are 23% higher than their May 2007 peak.

Title: Vanguard Adds Long-Overdue Junk Bond ETF at Tricky Time
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/etf/industry-news-etf/vanguard-adds-long-overdue-junk-bond-etf-at-tricky-time/
Time Published: 2025-09-17T10:05:00Z

The company filled a hole in its fixed-income ETF line — but the timing may not be ideal, given relatively low yields in junk bonds relative to Treasurys, one observer said. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com Need an active, fixed-income ETF? Vanguard just checked both boxes. The firm launched the High-Yield Active ETF (VGHY) today in its latest push into actively managed bond products. CEO Salim Ramji has prioritized the expansion and said last year that Vanguard was in a prime position to make its mark on a segment that he called antiquated and expensive. The new ETF is not a copy of Vanguard’s $25 billion High-Yield Corporate Fund, a mutual fund, but the ETF has broader coverage for credit quality, going as low as CCC (the mutual fund is focused on BB and B). “Both products will be well-supported, and investors will have the choice across our lineup,” said Rebecca Venter, senior fixed income product manager at Vanguard. “We’ve also seen over time that the high-yield corporate bond market has shifted quite dramatically since the Great Financial Crisis.” The traditional high-yield credit market has moved up in quality as a result of more lower-quality issuance in the bank loan and private credit markets, Venter said. Today, BB-rated debt accounts for over half of the high-yield market, she noted. Here’s how VGHY compares to the mutual fund: The fund, the ninth in Vanguard’s line of active bond ETFs, follows numerous other fixed income launches this year. In July, for example, the firm added three Treasury ETFs, following its addition of the Multisector Income Bond ETF in April. The company also rolled out two fixed income model portfolio options the same month. Junk Sale: It’s about time that Vanguard had a high-yield ETF, but the surprise in this launch is that the fund is actively managed, said Jeff DeMaso, editor of The Independent Vanguard Adviser. In an analysis he published today, DeMaso rated the ETF as a “buy,” but he also discouraged people from buying it, at least for a while. The reason for that? Spreads are tight, he said, with yields on corporate junk bonds being about 2 percentage points higher than yields on intermediate-term Treasurys, which is significantly below the long-term average of over 3.5 percentage points. “It’s about time Vanguard filled this gap,” DeMaso said. “But the launch comes at the wrong time. For now, patience — not bold moves — is the smarter play.” The New York-based firm is planning to launch some of the first tokenized ETFs, according to a report. Reckoner Capital Management, which added its Leveraged AAA CLO ETF in July, has aspirations of building out a global credit business. As new ETFs launch at breakneck speed, expensive products are raking in revenue. The firm’s founder claims a new ETF using fundamentals beyond market-cap weighting to determine holdings is the next big thing. Funds holding large financial institutions have significantly outperformed broad market indices this year. The exchange could start offering tokenization of securities, including exchange-traded products and stocks, next year. Amid a reversal in tax incentives that had started to buoy clean energy technologies, investors have pulled money from linked ETFs. The company, which sponsors a nearly $5 billion Bitcoin ETF along with ARK, is nixing the three other ETFs in that partnership. The SEC and CFTC recently issued a rare joint statement encouraging applications for new spot crypto products. Disney is the comeback kid of Wall Street, and other streaming giants are following suit. The company’s new U.S. Equity Total Return ETF invests in other exchange-traded funds in a way that minimizes dividend payments. If approved, Tuttle Capital Management would buck an industry trend in the options it uses, according to the company’s CEO. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Google's Nano Banana Moment: 50% Upside For GOOG Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/17/googles-nano-banana-moment-50-upside-for-goog-stock/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Google's stock has been making headlines, surpassing the $3 trillion market cap milestone as investor confidence grows. But here’s the bigger takeaway: even after this rally, Google still trades at a notable discount compared to Big Tech peers like Amazon and Microsoft. This recent surge isn’t just market hype—it could mark the start of a 50% rally for GOOG stock as the market finally recognizes that Google deserves premium valuations and reconsiders its pricing. The narrative around Google and AI is shifting. Remember when there was widespread fear that AI would cannibalize Google Search? That fear is quickly fading. Google’s Gemini, especially its viral “nano banana” feature, has propelled the Gemini app to the #1 spot on Apple’s App Store in the U.S. This shows that AI can enhance Google’s core offerings instead of threatening them. The market is finally acknowledging what we’ve been saying all along: treating AI as an existential threat to Google was always an overreaction. Instead, AI is turning out to be a complementary force that strengthens Google’s ecosystem. While we’ll explore Google stock’s upside below, if you want growth with less volatility than holding a single stock, check out the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with over 91% returns since inception. Also see – Can Natera Stock Reach $500? Here’s where the numbers get interesting. Google has long been the overlooked Big Tech player in terms of valuation multiples, and the data paints a compelling picture: The fundamentals say yes. Consider these key metrics: Microsoft’s premium valuation is warranted, but Google’s numbers aren’t far behind. Much of Google’s discount came from regulatory overhang—but with that mostly resolved, the rerating case has never been stronger. The move from 22x to 28x earnings shows this rerating has already begun. For Google to command Amazon- and Microsoft-like multiples (35x+), investors must see these key developments: Given these risks, investors could consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000 blend).

Title: Google's Nano Banana Moment: 50% Upside For GOOG Stock?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Google's stock has been making headlines, surpassing the $3 trillion market cap milestone as investor confidence grows. But here’s the bigger takeaway: even after this rally, Google still trades at a notable discount compared to Big Tech peers like Amazon and Microsoft. This recent surge isn’t just market hype—it could mark the start of a 50% rally for GOOG stock as the market finally recognizes that Google deserves premium valuations and reconsiders its pricing. The narrative around Google and AI is shifting. Remember when there was widespread fear that AI would cannibalize Google Search? That fear is quickly fading. Google’s Gemini, especially its viral “nano banana” feature, has propelled the Gemini app to the #1 spot on Apple’s App Store in the U.S. This shows that AI can enhance Google’s core offerings instead of threatening them. The market is finally acknowledging what we’ve been saying all along: treating AI as an existential threat to Google was always an overreaction. Instead, AI is turning out to be a complementary force that strengthens Google’s ecosystem. While we’ll explore Google stock’s upside below, if you want growth with less volatility than holding a single stock, check out the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with over 91% returns since inception. Also see – Can Natera Stock Reach $500? Here’s where the numbers get interesting. Google has long been the overlooked Big Tech player in terms of valuation multiples, and the data paints a compelling picture: The fundamentals say yes. Consider these key metrics: Microsoft’s premium valuation is warranted, but Google’s numbers aren’t far behind. Much of Google’s discount came from regulatory overhang—but with that mostly resolved, the rerating case has never been stronger. The move from 22x to 28x earnings shows this rerating has already begun. For Google to command Amazon- and Microsoft-like multiples (35x+), investors must see these key developments: Given these risks, investors could consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000 blend). This quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks offers a way to benefit from market upswings while cushioning downside risk, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: New ETF Shop Snags Former Janus Henderson Exec

Reckoner Capital Management, which added its Leveraged AAA CLO ETF in July, has aspirations of building out a global credit business. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com Without being koi, sometimes it’s nice to be a big fish in a small pond. Richard Hoge, a former COO of Janus Henderson’s ETF business, recently landed at Reckoner Capital Management, and has been tasked with building out its exchange traded fund suite (currently, the firm has one). The firm, which launched in February backed by RedBird Capital Partners, rolled out its $33 million Leveraged AAA CLO ETF (RAAA) in July. ETFs are a central piece of the company’s plan to build out a global credit platform, CEO John Kim said. “The aim is to bring alternative assets to various client bases in very easy-to-access wrappers,” he said, adding that the ETF market “is the most easily accessible for the vast majority of investors.” The ETF business is booming, continually breaking sales records, while a flood of new products come to market. But it’s dominated by a few massive players (ahem … BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street), and finding a niche for differentiation is becoming harder. Reckoner’s broad requirements for new ETFs are that they be strategies that belong in the format and aren’t the latest iterations of products that already exist, said Kim, who prior to the company’s founding was CEO and CIO of Panagram Structured Asset Management. On the first point, private credit is a no-go, given the liquidity constraints, he said. “We are very conscious of daily liquidity.” Hoge’s background could help with that: Let’s Get Real: Hoge, who has backgrounds in law and taxation, “knows the ETF market extremely well,” Kim said. “He has a lot of different viewpoints that he can bring to bear on new product creation… We need someone to be the realist in the room.” The New York-based firm is planning to launch some of the first tokenized ETFs, according to a report. The company filled a hole in its fixed-income ETF line — but the timing may not be ideal, given relatively low yields in junk bonds relative to Treasurys, one observer said. As new ETFs launch at breakneck speed, expensive products are raking in revenue. The firm’s founder claims a new ETF using fundamentals beyond market-cap weighting to determine holdings is the next big thing. Funds holding large financial institutions have significantly outperformed broad market indices this year. The exchange could start offering tokenization of securities, including exchange-traded products and stocks, next year. Amid a reversal in tax incentives that had started to buoy clean energy technologies, investors have pulled money from linked ETFs. The company, which sponsors a nearly $5 billion Bitcoin ETF along with ARK, is nixing the three other ETFs in that partnership. The SEC and CFTC recently issued a rare joint statement encouraging applications for new spot crypto products. Disney is the comeback kid of Wall Street, and other streaming giants are following suit. The company’s new U.S. Equity Total Return ETF invests in other exchange-traded funds in a way that minimizes dividend payments. If approved, Tuttle Capital Management would buck an industry trend in the options it uses, according to the company’s CEO. © 2025 The Daily Upside

‘Tis the season. Everyone is gearing up for that time of year — holiday shopping. Is your businesses’ search engine optimization (SEO) strategy ready for the holidays? If you just broke out into a cold sweat thinking about it, don’t worry — we’re here to help. We’ll explore tips, strategies, and budget-friendly tricks to make sure your business is found this holiday season (and beyond) — and how you can use your customer relationship management (CRM) tools to turn your top searchers into your top customers. What you’ll learn: AI search, including Google’s AI Overviews, Bing Copilot answers, and other LLM-powered engines, increasingly shapes how shoppers discover products during the holidays. A holiday AI SEO marketing strategy is a tactic to help small businesses appear in search engines and get seen for the holiday season — any season, really. Good SEO means making sure your digital presence is fully optimized, from your web copy to your store’s product descriptions to your opening hours, no matter what season it is. Let’s dig into why this is important. Effective SEO increases your brand’s visibility, driving more qualified leads to your website. These leads can then be captured and managed within your CRM system. In the reverse, content optimized for SEO can provide valuable information for your sales and marketing teams, enriching the data within your CRM. Also, by optimizing your website with the latest in AI-enabled SEO, you can personalize their experience and tailor your CRM efforts to nurture them more effectively. The future of SEO is AI-powered, and small businesses can get in on it too. The holidays are one of the few times of year when being small is an advantage. Surveys show 93% of U.S. consumers plan to “shop small” during the holiday season, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports that eight in ten small businesses say Q4 is critical for annual profit. Modern LLMs are trained to detect and surface businesses that align with high-intent queries like “local gifts near me,” “independent bookstores with fast shipping,” or “family-owned bakery Christmas pies.” To be recognized, SMBs need to make these signals explicit. Practical steps: How a CRM can help: A CRM allows you to segment your customer base and understand their past purchases and preferences. This means you can create highly targeted promotions, gift guides, and website copy that resonate with specific customer groups, increasing the likelihood they’ll click through from search or answer engine results. No matter where you are on your journey as a small business, you can get started with Starter Suite — the all-in-one CRM for SMBs. Customer reviews are vital, but they’re not the only trust signal that matters in AI search. Answer engines cross-reference multiple sources before including a business in an answer. Local press mentions, chamber of commerce directories, event sponsorships, and nonprofit partnerships are all citations that machines can parse and validate. Practical steps: How a CRM can help: A CRM can help manage these efforts by centralizing contact information, tracking outreach, segmenting customer data, automating reminders for updates, and managing event planning. By proactively managing these diverse trust signals, businesses can improve their visibility and credibility in AI search.. Shoppers are no longer just typing. The proliferation of voice assistants and visual search tools means your business must be discoverable beyond traditional text queries. In fact, Google Lens reports billions of monthly image searches alone, so SMBs should think beyond text. Get your website voice-ready: Make your images findable: Multimodal AI discovery isn’t hypothetical; it’s happening now. A shopper might snap a photo of a candle on TikTok and ask, “Where can I buy this locally?” in search, and land on your store if your assets are properly tagged. How a CRM can help: By organizing customer data and preferences, a CRM enables businesses to create more targeted and relevant content that can be surfaced through voice and visual searches. Also, CRM data can help businesses keep branding and product information consistent across their online presence. Large retailers publish long holiday gift guides on their sites, but SMBs can win by publishing specific guides focused on certain topics or personas. In an AI-first world, specificity wins. AI overviews often surface micro-content that maps tightly to niche intents: “teacher gifts under $25,” “last-minute local pickup in Brooklyn,” “eco-friendly hostess gifts.” These focused guides often map directly to LLM-driven answer boxes, which pull concise, niche content to satisfy specific shopping intents. For SMBs, creating multiple focused guides is both achievable and impactful. Instead of pouring effort into a 2,000-word omnibus guide, launch three to five smaller landing pages: Each page should feature short answer capsules, such as: “Hand-poured soy candle, $22, available for same-day pickup. Perfect for teacher gifts – eco-friendly and long-lasting.” These capsules can be lifted directly into AI summaries, while the pages themselves capture long-tail traffic. Cross-link guides to relevant product pages and vice versa, ensuring both human shoppers and AI systems see the connections. How a CRM can help: By segmenting customer data, a CRM enables businesses to identify niche intents and create relevant guides that capture long-tail traffic. Additionally, a CRM can help businesses cross-link guides to relevant product pages. Learn how autonomous AI can scale your small business for efficient growth in our free e-book. Google’s guidance emphasizes E-E-A-T: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. This humanization isn’t just about trust; it’s a critical differentiator. SMBs have an edge here. While big-box retailers rely on mass-produced descriptions, you can signal authenticity with small touches. What works: Research shows consumers increasingly value authenticity: 88% say they’re more likely to buy again after a great service experience, according to the latest State of the Connected Customer report. AI raters are trained to look for this, too — pages that show lived experience (“we tested,” “our team recommends”) are more likely to surface than generic, stock copy. How a CRM can help: A CRM can help small businesses demonstrate E-E-A-T and authenticity by managing customer interactions and data that inform personalized content, such as customer testimonials, product recommendations, and staff-curated content. Additionally, a CRM can help businesses track customer interactions and feedback, allowing them to refine their content and improve overall customer experience. AI engines don’t just crawl websites; they also increasingly draw from community conversations on social media. Mentions in Reddit threads, TikTok videos, or Quora answers can seed authority signals that flow back into AI-curated summaries, acting as powerful, unlinked brand mentions. For example, shoppers often post on Reddit boards like r/Gifts or r/BuyItForLife asking for holiday ideas. If a satisfied customer mentions your handmade product there, it becomes part of the training data that models like Perplexity or ChatGPT may cite. Similarly, TikTok’s algorithm surfaces local businesses for trending holiday gift tags, and AI scrapes those public posts. Practical plays: AI engines are trained to identify consensus, along with other things. A handful of high-signal mentions in the right community can outweigh dozens of low-quality backlinks. For SMBs, that’s a winnable path to visibility. How a CRM can help: A CRM can track customer mentions, reviews, and feedback, helping businesses to identify opportunities to encourage happy customers to share their experiences and showcase their products in community forums. By integrating social media data, a CRM can also help businesses monitor their authority signals and adjust their marketing strategies accordingly. Cross-platform visibility means your business information is identical, and present, across the digital platforms that AI reconciles: your site, Google Business Profile (GBP), marketplaces (Amazon, Etsy, Walmart), and social shops. AI systems (and people) mistrust mismatches, and guidance from Google stresses consistent, helpful, non-commodity content. Parity checklist (check weekly during peak holiday times): Why it matters: AI will show fewer options. Brands with coherent facts across touchpoints are safer to include. How a CRM can help: A CRM centralizes your customer and product data, ensuring consistency across your website, Google Business Profile, marketplaces, and social media platforms. By managing this data in one place, businesses can easily update product information, pricing, and other details across multiple channels, reducing the risk of mismatches and inconsistencies. Set up your digital storefront, engage customers, and sell more using a commerce-ready platform with integrated tools for every sale. Google’s holiday research highlights how spur-of-the-moment mobile sessions drive decisions; four in five smartphone holiday shoppers use their phone in spare moments, and those micro-moments add up. Here’s how to make sure your SMB site is set up for these micro-moments. 90-second purchase checklist: How a CRM can help: A CRM can help small businesses capture shoppers on the go by managing detail-heavy customer interactions and data that inform targeted marketing efforts, such as SMS reminders and instant promotions. Small Business Saturday, taking place every fall, is a moment to compound visibility: spikes in local search, social shares, and reviews build authority that carries into December. The SBA cites long-running consumer participation and cumulative spend; Constant Contact found one-third of annual revenue can hinge on the holiday season for many SMBs. Here’s how you can get it on the Small Business Saturday traffic in the week leading up to November 5: How a CRM can help: With a CRM, you can automate and personalize your marketing efforts, such as sending targeted emails and SMS messages, and track customer behavior and preferences for future marketing strategies. Additionally, a CRM can help you manage your business’s online presence by storing customer data, preferences, and interactions in one place, making it easier to execute any Small Business Saturday marketing plans. The biggest SMB constraint isn’t strategy; it’s time. That’s why automation should be targeted at the areas where consistency matters most to AI: feeds, inventory, and customer communication. Automation frees you to focus on building trust (content, reviews, partnerships). For many SMBs, platforms like Salesforce Starter Suite and Pro Suite make this achievable – unifying storefront, CRM, and simple marketing automation in one place. Automation priorities: How a CRM can help: By unifying storefront, CRM, and marketing automation in one place, a CRM enables businesses to refresh product feeds multiple times a day, automate “out of stock” updates, and schedule timely reminders for shipping cutoffs. By taking this busy work off your plate, a CRM lets you focus on the bigger picture. Learn how your business can benefit from this out-of-the-box CRM. Salesforce for Small Business Holidays don’t just test large retailers; they reveal how small businesses can carve out visibility in AI-powered shopping flows. For SMBs, the differentiator is agility: being clear, consistent, and credible across local and digital touchpoints. A CRM system plays a crucial role in this agility by unifying customer data, product information, and marketing efforts in one place. Small businesses that invest in structured data, authentic content, and cross-platform consistency—made easier through a CRM—will get their products surfaced in AI-curated answers at the very moment shoppers are ready to buy. And by using a CRM, SMBs can ensure that their customer interactions, product feeds, and marketing communications are consistent and accurate across all platforms, which is critical for AI visibility. Start your journey with a free trial of Starter Suite today. Looking for more customization? Explore Pro Suite. Already a Salesforce customer? Activate Foundations to try out Agentforce today. AI supported the writers and editors who created this article. How does AI search change holiday marketing for small businesses? AI search emphasizes structured data, local relevance, and authentic content, shifting focus from traditional keyword stuffing to providing clear, consistent, and human-centric information that AI can easily understand and surface. What is “E-E-A-T” and why is it important for small businesses in AI search? E-E-A-T stands for Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. For small businesses, it’s crucial because AI values authentic, lived experience and signals of trustworthiness. Highlighting founder stories, staff picks, and behind-the-scenes content can demonstrate E-E-A-T and improve AI visibility. How can small businesses improve social media to improve their AI search visibility? AI engines increasingly draw information from community conversations on social media platforms like TikTok and Reddit. Encouraging customers to post authentic content and engaging in niche forums can create strong authority signals that AI models may cite, acting as powerful, unlinked brand mentions. What are “micro-moments” in holiday shopping, and how can SMBs optimize for them? Micro-moments refer to brief, spur-of-the-moment mobile sessions where shoppers make quick decisions. SMBs can optimize by ensuring fast website loading speeds, offering quick payment options like guest checkout, providing “buy online, pick up in store” (BOPIS) capabilities, and offering instant gift cards or SMS reminders for shipping or availability cutoffs. What role does a CRM system play in a small business’ holiday AI marketing strategy? A CRM system centralizes customer data, product information, and marketing efforts, ensuring consistency across all digital touchpoints. This allows businesses to automate tasks like inventory updates and personalized communications, freeing up time and ensuring data accuracy, which is critical for AI visibility.

Title: Class Action Filed Against Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Seeking Recovery for Investors – Contact Levi & Korsinsky

September 16, 2025 17:14 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Sept. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=167332&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate. WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases.

Litigation Partner Brandon Walker Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses In iRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you are a long-term stockholder in iRobot between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648. NEW YORK, Sept. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against iRobot Corporation (NASDAQ:IRBT) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against iRobot on July 7, 2025 with a Class Period from January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of iRobot have breached their fiduciary duties to the company. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you are a long-term stockholder of iRobot, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, by telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Turbo Energy S.A. TURB stock skyrocketed Tuesday after the company announced it won a $53 million contract to deliver energy storage projects in Spain with a total capacity of 366 MWh over the next two years. The deal involves more than 10 sites operated by a major construction industry client. Turbo Energy will integrate its systems fully and use its AI-based management platform to help the facilities cut power costs, improve efficiency, and expand electrification. Mariano Soria, CEO of Turbo Energy, said the agreement highlights confidence in the company's storage technology. "By entrusting us with the deployment of our C&I systems across multiple industrial facilities, this project is not only validating our competitively differentiated storage technology but also enabling substantial operational cost savings," he said.

With a range from 30 kW to 2,000 kW and storage capacity of 30 kWh to 4,000 kWh, SUNBOX Industry offers flexibility for industrial users. Its brand-agnostic design allows it to work with legacy infrastructure, easing expansion for customers facing volatile energy markets. The project advances both customer sustainability goals and Europe's decarbonization push. Turbo Energy said the expansion strengthens its role in large-scale storage and its commitment to cost-efficient clean power. Turbo Energy also revealed last week that it signed a landmark deal with Uber Technologies UBER to power the company's EV fleet in Spain. The project uses its SUNBOX Industry system to overcome grid constraints by adding flexible storage capacity, creating a 1 MW / 2 MWh smart hub capable of charging more than 300 vehicles. CEO Mariano Soria said the initiative showcases a scalable model for fleet electrification, underscoring the role of advanced storage in Europe's transportation decarbonization. ETFs such as the Invesco Solar ETF TAN and iShares Global Clean Energy ETF ICLN also provide exposure to the renewable energy market.

Title: Charlie Kirk Predicted: “AI Will Take Your Jobs in the Next Five Years”

Time Published: 2025-09-16T15:25:56Z

By Byron King PostedSeptember 16, 2025 “This is my broad opinion on AI (artificial intelligence),” said the man speaking to a crowd of over 1,500 students at the University of Tennessee. “For about 95% of what all of you guys are studying, AI will take your jobs in the next five years.” This comment is from last March, by the late Charlie Kirk during a visit to U of T’s Knoxville campus. Kirk answered a student’s question about studying AI, considering Kirk’s well-known skepticism of the value of much of what passes for education in current American Academe. The late Charlie Kirk, speaking at University of Tennessee last March. Courtesy Knox News/News Sentinel. Kirk was a humble person, and certainly never presented himself as a scholar on the topic of AI. So, he may or may not have been correct about that 95% number, and/or what havoc AI will wreak on the job market over “the next five years.” On that point, we must live, learn, watch, wait and see. Perhaps AI will eliminate less than 95% of jobs, and perhaps the looming juggernaut might take longer than five years to put many people out of work. But one way or another, Kirk nailed the point that a highly disruptive AI trend is taking shape. More on that in just a moment… Meanwhile, the AI investment boom has already delivered huge gains to investors who bought early, and even to investors who jumped aboard the proverbial moving train a bit late, as it left the station. For example, and to highlight just a few names among many, we’ve seen huge moves in share price for companies that make advanced computer chips (NVDIA Corp.; NVDA), and the machinery that makes chips (ASML Holdings; ASML); software plays and system integrators (Oracle Corp; ORCL); and certainly, with the energy angle that powers AI and ranges from electric utilities (Constellation Energy; CEG) to equipment makers (GE Vernova; GEV). Again, more on this this last angle in a moment as well… But first, no doubt you know that Charlie Kirk was gunned down last week while hosting one of his trademark debate events (“Prove Me Wrong!”), this time at Utah Valley University, outside of Salt Lake City. He was assassinated by a sniper who fired a single shot. And the shooter – the “alleged shooter” as we’re supposed to say – is in custody. The suspect is 22 years old and wasn’t associated with the university. Indeed, news accounts state that a couple of years ago, this guy dropped out of an entirely different college and enrolled in a trade school. He walked onto the Utah Valley campus last week for one reason only… As is almost always the case, right now there’s much we don’t know. The state and federal investigation is ongoing, although it’s not out of bounds to say that, based on recovered communications, perhaps the perp had associates. And perhaps he’s not just another “disturbed lone gunman” of popular myth when important people get shot. We’ll see. Plus, in this same context we have a developing, fast-growing narrative about how certain kinds of people become criminally radicalized by what they see and follow on the internet and social media (more accurately, “anti-social media”). Birds of a feather, so to speak. In fact, the man in custody appears to be a subset of disgruntled humanity that intelligence services refer to as “nihilist extremists.” As derived from the Latin word nihil, which means “nothing,” and the belief in a sense of nothingness. But in the case of certain individuals, they take their nothingness to the far edges of misconduct. In this particular case it was the cold-blooded public execution of a private citizen who also happened to be a nationally recognized public and politically influential figure. To me at least, the murder of Charlie Kirk is arguably the highest profile political assassination in America since the 1960s; since the days of Robert Kennedy, Sr. and Martin Luther King. (Note: President Reagan survived his 1981 encounter, just barely.) And this leads to a couple of points. Definitely (as in… obviously), many American colleges and universities lean politically left. Just visit a few campuses and walk around. And it’s not out of bounds – not for me, anyhow – to opine that a distressingly large number of impressionable young minds have been ruined by exposure to the Marxian milieus that dominate many humanities and social science departments within so-called “higher” education. Cartoon that speaks for itself. Courtesy Zero Hedge. Meanwhile, saving or salvaging young people from a lifetime intellectual handicap of early-onset, left-wing indoctrination was among Charlie Kirk’s missions in life, and brought him to his fateful, fatal visit to Utah last week. He was good at his job, so yeah, somebody shot him. At the same time, in this instance it’s evident that Kirk’s shooter was not radicalized in college; as noted above, the guy dropped out of a completely different school and there was no first-hand college knowledge inside this fellow’s head. In other words, with whatever degree of radicalism we have with Kirk’s assassin, he apparently picked it up on his own, inside the echo chambers of online content that he followed. Looking ahead, it’s likely that forensic investigators will scrub his internet history for everything they can find; maybe we’ll learn a few things. And this brings up something that I’ve heard from more than a few college and university faculty members. Namely, that many incoming students show up at the front gates already radicalized by their high school experiences at both public and private/independent secondary schools. So, the left-oriented indoctrination machine is not entirely a collegiate phenomenon because more than a few secondary schools have also been overrun and captured as well. Plus, an even broader issue is at work here. It’s that anymore, young people everywhere have grown up in an unfiltered world of smart phones and global-scale internet access to anything and everything that can flow through the fibers and Wi-Fi channels. The good, the bad, and the ugly. The takeaway is that we’re now reaping the harvest of about a (so-far) 20-year, uncontrolled, mass-psychological experiment. In essence, American society, and the nation’s overall economic system, allowed everyone – certainly children and young adults – to have constant, instant access to everything that’s out there in the ether. Which prompts one to ask, “Was this ever a good idea?” Sure, some kids have benefitted greatly from their lifetime of online access. Perhaps they became much smarter, much faster, at a much earlier age than otherwise might have been the case. Hey, maybe some of them now work for SpaceX, building better rocket engines. Or they’re changing the world for the better in other ways. But other people – obviously, look at the recent Kirk shooter – hung out online, fried their brain with antisocial content, and became dangerously radicalized. In short, they developed a deeply flawed moral compass and bizarre worldviews. Meanwhile, it’s not as if Kirk’s shooter is some sort of impressionable dummy. From news accounts the perp is supposedly an intelligent person. One report stated that he scored an impressive 34 out of 36 on the ACT, a high school standardized exam that’s widely used to rank applicants by college admission committees. And in this regard, Kirk’s shooter joins quite a rogues’ gallery of otherwise-intelligent people who traveled down a dark road. For example, Thomas Crooks, the 20-year-old who shot President Trump last year in Butler, Pennsylvania reputedly scored over 1500 on his SAT exams, a result good enough to be considered as an entrant for even the most competitive of colleges. Or think back to other eras and instances when smart people went bad. For example, in the 1960s a young Ted Kaczynski (aka the Unabomber) earned a degree in mathematics from Harvard and then an MS and PhD in math from the University of Michigan. And going further back in history to 1865, a then-26-year-old John Wilkes Booth – among the greatest and fastest-rising Shakespearean actors of his era – assassinated President Abraham Lincoln. In this regard, it’s not as if political radicalization is a modern phenomenon. Nor even nihilism and extremism, because the archives of time reveal many young guys who crossed the lines and did terrible things. But anymore, it also appears that our internet age is capable of creating and spreading dysfunction and radicalization at wide, even industrial scale and affecting growing numbers of people. Here’s the quandary: we have an open system that leads more and more people to go nihilist, and then down extreme pathways. Which brings us back to Charlie Kirk’s comment about AI taking away jobs… “I love that,” said Kirk to his questioner. “I love the AI discussion because it’s going to flush out ethical arguments immediately. … It is going to force the greatest question of what is a human being? What is right? What is wrong? So I’m curious, at the University of Tennessee, what do they consider to be ethical?” Well, here we have some unusual questions! And from Charlie Kirk, who was upfront about the fact that he never attended college or university. He turned 18 and went into business with his Turning Point organization. Usually, public discussion of AI is about how great and wonderful it is. And about all the companies whose shares are soaring in the stock market. Or the hundreds of billions of dollars of capital investment going into hardware, software, data centers, electric power and more. Or the hype about what AI is already doing, and how it will eventually do even more and better in the future. That, and if “we” don’t somehow win the ongoing global AI arms race, China will win it and dominate the world. And there was Charlie Kirk in Knoxville, pondering the ethics of AI. Right away, one gets the sense that he foreshadowed his own eventual, tragic fate at the hands of a guy (or maybe a cabal of guys) who used existing online content to override any sense of classical ethics, and to spool himself/themselves to the point of targeted assassination. Another way to frame the issue is that the past 20-plus years of unfettered growth of the internet, and online access to anything/everything, has led to a national-scale level of political polarization that we see now (and certainly, with the above-noted nihilist extremist crowd). So, looking ahead, what might we expect from the next 20-plus years of AI? Well first, nobody knows, although this last question is absolutely worth pondering because AI is already many steps above the mere, day-to-day, old-fashioned internet thingy. Indeed, AI is a process that scrapes entire libraries of data from the online archives, and reshapes it and reforms it into… well, into what? Okay sure, it’s one thing for a high school or college kid to use AI to “help” write a term paper; and yes, I’m being charitable here. It’s quite another when AI takes over key elements of how we run society. Think in terms of AI-generated news, government policy stances, economic and even military decisions. (Whoops, too late; many military decisions are already AI-driven, up to and including when to fire weapons and at what targets.) Meanwhile, let’s return to Kirk’s comment that I used at the beginning of this note, about how “AI will take your jobs in the next five years.” Umm, yes… That’s already happening. Consider the news accounts of companies across the spectrum that are replacing people with AI, from banks and real estate to medicine and factory production. Just scan a few headlines about how difficult it is for young college grads to find jobs anymore, and how many young people are taking whatever work they can land, just to have a paycheck, versus finding a job in what they studied in school. So, per Charlie Kirk, AI will take away the jobs that college kids hope to have. And there, he has bracketed one key the point. What does the AI future hold? Well, the irony is that even big-name AI plays (the usual suspects) offer diminishing hope ever to justify their currently lofty share prices. That is, much of the AI race involves spending massive capex up front on equipment, buildouts, software and some sort of whiz-bang product to offer for sale. But the AI sales numbers – revenues that ring the cash register – are generally awful. And the dark implication is that all this up-front outlay is driving the broad sector towards commodity-level pricing, which means that few players will ever make any serious money. There’s an argument to be made that AI – well, AI as currently practiced – is a massive misallocation of resources, with next to no real forecast about what it will do to large and growing segments of the populace. Radicalization, anyone? Nihilism? Extremism? Hey, give it time. Sadly and tragically, we won’t have Charlie Kirk anymore, out there asking simple but insightful questions and debating the replies. In this regard, it falls to others to confront the orthodoxy of big money flowing willy-nilly into untested ideas and undiscovered lands. Oh, and if you have made some good money in AI, be sure to take a whack off the table and find another home for it when things begin to crater. Buy gold, for example. That’s all for now. Thank you for subscribing and reading.

In July, Microsoft reported fourth-quarter revenue of $76.44 billion, up 17% year-over-year. The revenue total beat a Street consensus estimate of $73.80. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings per share of $3.65, beating a Street consensus estimate of $3.37. For the first quarter, Microsoft expects sales in a range of $74.70 billion to $75.80 billion versus $74.07 billion analyst estimate. Analysts have highlighted Microsoft’s cloud and artificial intelligence momentum as key growth drivers. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives described the company’s fourth-quarter results as “eye-popping,” citing strong demand for cloud services and AI products. “Microsoft delivered strong fourth quarter results with strong guidance to start the year as the company’s ‘shining moment’ is now underway with AI already changing the growth trajectory of MSFT’s cloud growth story,” Ives said. He pointed to the launch of Azure AI Foundry as particularly important for enterprise adoption, adding that fiscal 2026 could be the company’s “true inflection year” for AI-driven growth. “We believe Microsoft is just hitting its next phase of monetization on the AI front,” he said. Other analysts have echoed that optimism. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Thomas Blakey maintained an Overweight rating and raised his price forecast from $581 to $639. Oppenheimer analyst Brian Schwartz reiterated an Outperform rating and lifted his forecast from $600 to $630. KeyBanc analyst Jackson Ader upgraded the stock to Overweight with a $630 forecast. Piper Sandler’s Brent Bracelin also reaffirmed an Overweight rating, raising his forecast from $600 to $650.

Δ The new financing, announced Tuesday (Sept. 16), brings the company’s total funding to $144 million and will be used to invest in Invisible’s core AI software platform. A report by Bloomberg News, citing sources familiar with the matter, says the new funding values Invisible at $2 billion. “I have spent the last decade experiencing both the promises and limitations of enterprise AI, driven by the fact that 70% of the software in the world is over 20 years old,” CEO Matthew Fitzpatrick said in a news release. “Despite the recent excitement, most enterprises are still struggling to get AI models into production and to quantify ROI. Invisible changes that. Our software platform, combined with our expert marketplace, enables companies to organize, clean, label, and map their data. This foundation enables them to build agentic workflows that drive real impact.” The release notes that Invisible was named the number two fastest growing AI companies on the 2024 Inc. 5000 List. The firm’s revenue more than doubled from 2023 to 2024, reaching $134 million, following a 24-fold increase between 2020 and 2023.

All of which reinforce the momentum behind agentic AI,” the report added. Meanwhile, recent PYMNTS Intelligence research finds that despite all the attention centered on Gen Z’s comfort with AI, it’s millennials who are using the technology at work. This embrace, PYMNTS wrote last week, shows how AI is moving from novelty to utility. The research shows that 52% of millennials use gen AI for work, the highest of any generation, while 61% report that gen AI helps them accomplish more, faster. “More than 70% of millennial users are highly satisfied with gen AI tools — more than any other generation,” PYMNTS added. “Only 6.5% report low satisfaction, suggesting that their adoption is not just frequent, but confident.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom’s stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has climbed nearly 20% in one month, fueled by an optimistic company outlook and a new $10 billion client contract. This significant gain, however, has pushed its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to 91. The key question is: How does AVGO stock now compare to its peers, such as NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Intel, and Cisco, in terms of size, valuation, growth, and margins? To provide some context, Broadcom offers semiconductor devices and infrastructure software, which includes set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking solutions. Why is this important?

Title: How Lyft’s CEO Got the Company Moving Again

Time Published: 2025-09-16T12:10:00Z

What it takes to rebuild confidence, culture, and competitive edge. In the winter of 2023, Lyft was facing declining market share and financial pressures. Enter new CEO David Risher, who took the helm amid low morale and limited resources. His challenge: reignite innovation, refocus the culture, and find new ways to stand out in an industry dominated by Uber. Harvard Business School professor Ranjay Gulati joins host Brian Kenny to discuss the case “Lyft 2023: Roads to Growth and Differentiation.” They explore how Risher led during a strategic crossroads, making bold decisions, putting the customer front and center, and shaking loose old habits. Gulati also shares insights from his new book, How to Be Bold, illustrating how courage becomes a competitive advantage in times of uncertainty. BRIAN KENNY: Welcome to Cold Call, the podcast where we delve deep into the stories behind groundbreaking Harvard Business School case studies. It’s pretty rare for an industry to go from zero to Mach speed in just a few years, but that’s exactly how it’s gone for rideshare services. Since the first peer-to-peer rideshare service launched in 2012, well over a billion people have climbed aboard. Today we’ll dive deep into this phenomenon with a case about Lyft, long the challenger in the ridesharing industry. They faced a choice: double down on product innovation, reinvest in a neglected brand, or simply shore up operations after years of crisis. With a new leader at the wheel, the firm was at a crossroad that called for bold, decisive leadership. Today we’ll unpack the case, discuss how boldness shapes corporate strategy and leadership, and explore what it takes to turn courage into a competitive advantage. Today on Cold Call, we welcome Professor Ranjay Gulati to discuss the case “Lyft 2023: Roads to Growth and Differentiation.” I’m your host Brian Kenny, and you’re listening to Cold Call on the HBR Podcast Network. Ranjay Gulati’s work explores leadership and strategic challenges for building high-growth organizations in turbulent markets. His new book, How to Be Bold: The Surprising Science of Everyday Courage explores how individuals and organizations can cultivate courage, reframe fear, and act boldly in the face of uncertainty. In many ways, Lyft’s story provides a rich backdrop to test these ideas in action. And he’s also a fellow podcaster. Ranjay, welcome. RANJAY GULATI: Thank you very much, Brian. Great to be here. BRIAN KENNY: You’re on the other side of the mic today. So, Ranjay hosts a show called Deep Purpose. You can find that on Apple or Spotify or wherever you listen, and it’s good to have you back on the show. It’s been too long. RANJAY GULATI: I know, Brian, it was great fun last time. I’m delighted to be back. BRIAN KENNY: This is a great case. I mean, we’ve all climbed into the back of a Lyft or an Uber, and those are the two major players, but by no means the only players in this space. So, the case actually comes in a little bit into their growth period where they’re facing some real significant challenges, and our protagonist is taking the helm there, and we’ll talk about all of that. So why don’t we just dive right in. I’m going to ask you to tell us what drew you to write about Lyft. Why did you think this would be a good case for the classroom, and what’s your cold call when you start the discussion? RANJAY GULATI: So, it’s interesting, when you write a case, you may start with one thing, and you may end up completely somewhere else. So, this is one of those stories where I started with a hypothesis about what the case was going to be about. It was really another illustration of a company that had a purpose as a founding principle and how they were trying to live by it. And the purpose was not to build a rideshare business. The purpose was to connect communities in places like Los Angeles, where the two founders were living. And so the idea was that a lot of people who don’t have access to a vehicle or parking or whatever are unable to connect, and it feels a fragmented, alienated life over there. So, this would be a way to bring people closer together. So, I was intrigued by how that kind of kernel of an idea became the basis of their strategy of how they were going to grow their business, about who they wanted to be. But then as I learned more, fast forward, what you discover is that for a variety of reasons, Uber comes into the picture, takes off, dominates, and suddenly now you are a one-third, two-third duopoly. Now, they’ve tried to differentiate and create some differentiation with their drivers and things like that, but even that is going away fast because the riders overlap across Uber and Lyft, so they’re not unique drivers anymore. Customers, you say, okay, I’m going to create stickiness for customers. Everybody has Uber and Lyft on their phone. They’re shopping across and choosing whoever’s the lowest price. Talk about commodity hell. So now what do you do? So, suddenly the case evolved from a study about just purpose to one about competing in commoditizing duopoly markets where the other competitor is bigger than you, has a more diverse revenue stream, can choose to make this a loss-leader. Now, how do you compete in this market? But then they became a third thing into the picture, which was now you have a new CEO. By the way, happens to be one of our alums, and he’s got to figure out, the founders are stepping away. Now you have this awkward transition where when founders set a step aside, professional management comes in and they got to figure out what do you do. BRIAN KENNY: What’s your cold call to start that discussion? RANJAY GULATI: I jump right into the case because I’ve had David Risher in class when I teach the case. So, I start by saying, “You’re David Risher. You’ve come into this business. What is your plan? What are you going to do in the first hundred days? What are you going to do in the first 300 days?” BRIAN KENNY: Wow. RANJAY GULATI: “And I want both plans nailed down, now.” BRIAN KENNY: That’s a brutal cold call. I wouldn’t want to be on the receiving end of that. So, David is the HBS alum that you mentioned. He’s the protagonist in the case. He’s the one who stepped in to this leadership role in 2023. How would you characterize some of the dilemmas that he was facing? What was he up against? RANJAY GULATI: He was up against pretty significant headwinds because they had come through a particularly brutal COVID because they entirely depend on rideshare, which essentially came to a grinding halt and took a long time to recover back. Meanwhile, Uber had Uber Eats, which was actually a dramatic growth business in COVID. So, here you have a competitor who’s really gained in the previous period, and you are coming from a place of weakness, from a place where you don’t have reserves to go and invest in something big. And so limited resources, layoffs, morale. So, you’re coming through the shadow of darkness over here, while those guys have just rode the wave through, and now you’ve got to find a way. And commoditization has really taken off, because drivers, you have two customers, right? The drivers who are now agnostic between Lyft and Uber, not always the case before. BRIAN KENNY: So, David Risher comes into a culture that already exists. The founders of Lyft had a pretty specific vision for what they wanted to do, and any leader stepping into that role is going to face the challenge of the legacy but also trying to drive the culture forward. What were some of the things that David tried to do? RANJAY GULATI: One of the first things David had to do was overcome internal inertia. And I think somehow sometimes organizations that have a great idea and execute on the idea; they were more successful beyond their wildest of dreams. Even though Uber was even bigger, and Uber has gone global and done all these things, Lyft was very successful. And what does success do to some? Not all, is it makes them fall into what I loosely call the success trap. And the success trap is now you become so fearful of losing what you have, you stop trying to win. And when you do that, you are caught in a vicious cycle of inability to try and experiment, learn, fail, grow. And so, you’re caught in a market that is stagnating, homogenizing, and you are unable to innovate your way into something new. David’s opening letter, what he said about himself, his self-introduction, is also very important because that gives you a kernel of where he’s trying to go. His first point, he says, “Listen, I’ve worked in three organizations. I worked at Microsoft, Amazon, and at this nonprofit.” And he says, “The three things I’ve learned is at Microsoft, I learned about the power of innovation. Innovation is what allows you to be competitive in the marketplace.” He said, “From Amazon, I learned the importance of customer obsession, that you can’t just be customer-centric, you got to be obsessed. It’s an emotional thing, not just a rational thing.” And he said, “From my nonprofit days, I learned the power and importance of frugality, doing more with less. How do you get things done with limited resources?” So, he was going to bring these three perspectives into Lyft. BRIAN KENNY: What were some of the things that came out of that? What were some of the initiatives that he really focused on early on? RANJAY GULATI: So, one of the initiatives that actually was on the cards, they had already debated and discussed it. It wasn’t even David’s original thought, but they had set it aside for whatever reason was this idea of matching female passengers to female drivers. And this was going to be mutually beneficial because many female passengers prefer a female driver. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, that makes sense. RANJAY GULATI: Given all the, in fact, recent tragic stories we’ve been hearing about attacks on passengers. So that was one. But even for the drivers, turned out that many female drivers would not drive rideshare, and they would instead do food delivery, even though you earn less in food delivery than in rideshare. But they felt it was less safe. BRIAN KENNY: I see. RANJAY GULATI: So, they were going to attract these drivers who were doing food share, food deliveries into rideshare saying, we will guarantee only female passengers. It was an idea they already had but for some reason hadn’t executed it. It reminded me of Anne Mulcahy story. Anne Mulcahy was the former CEO of Xerox, which legendarily owned Xerox, PARC and had all these innovations that Apple ran off with, which was the graphical user interface on the mouse. And she said in my class one time, “We didn’t launch products. They escaped from us.” And I don’t know why in some organizations you see that where the ideas may be there, they percolate around, people talk about them, they debate them, then the naysayers kick in, and somehow they get shelved. BRIAN KENNY: Right. Right. But it takes some bold leadership to actually revive that and push it through in an existing culture. How was David able to size up what he needed to do and move people in the same direction? Did he face opposition? RANJAY GULATI: In class, he’s talked about that. Yes, he did. But at least to jumpstart the process, leaders need to own it: OK, this is on me. This one’s on me, not on you. I’m not going to blame anybody else. This one’s on me. I own it. And that encourages others to then take ownership. And I think this willingness to step, you’re not going to become an autocrat and drive it constantly top down only. Eventually you’re going to build that confidence. I think people sometimes lose confidence. And then you need to boost up that confidence. And once you get them going, you’re then able to see the process unfold. And if you fast forward and see what Lyft has done in the last year and a half, you’ll see the positive results, the expansion into Europe, the now doing preferred driver choices, there’s a number of new things suddenly coming out of this company that actually was stagnating. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, yeah. Let’s talk about your new book because when I invited you to come on the show, I said, Is there a case that you think will help us to bring the ideas of your book to the surface? And you immediately landed on the Lyft case. Why does this case do a good job representing some of the big themes in your book? And maybe you can describe some of those themes to us. RANJAY GULATI: So, the book is called, How to Be Bold: The Science of Everyday Courage. The book is now about the individual level, two-thirds of the book about individual courage. And the last third is about organizational courage. But when I first began writing this book, it was about organizational courage. It was all about, How do you create courage? Now, when you think about the word “courage,” what is courage? Courage is not the absence of fear. Courage is taking action in the face of fear. So, let’s get that out of the way. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, I like that. RANJAY GULATI: The second thing is now if it’s about action in the face of fear, fear is a primal human emotion that is hardwired in the reptilian brain. It’s a survival emotion: Get out of here, save yourself. Now the question is, what activates that? It turns out there’s great research showing that what activates fear is the situational context of uncertainty. When we encounter uncertainty, it instantly activates fear. Now, let me go back, unpeel the onion one more. What is uncertainty? There was a very famous essay by Frank Knight, the economist, on the distinction between risk and uncertainty. Risk is where you know the distribution of outcomes and you can put some probabilities on those outcomes. Uncertainty is, I don’t know. And if you look at present day and time, we are in an era of unprecedented uncertainty. In fact, in a recent article, somebody analyzed earnings calls by CEOs and found that in the last quarter, CEOs mentioned the word “uncertainty” three times as often as they did in the previous quarter. So, the word is out there; we all feeling it. When we experience uncertainty, the natural normal human response is one of fear. Now, the question then is, do we let fear take over? Because fear left to its own devices hijacks the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. And the typical response is one of freeze or flight. Now, if you look at Lyft back then, I didn’t interview them back then, so I don’t know what it was exactly like, but my hypothesis is that it had a freeze response. They were stuck and unable to do much about it. You’re in a market that is rapidly commoditizing. You have a competitor who is much bigger than you, who has diversified their income streams, and so is not totally reliant on this one business, which is the US ridesharing business. What are you going to do? So, to understand this strategic lock or freeze, you got to really understand organizations too have collective emotion, and fear becomes a paralyzing emotion unless you’re willing to face it. BRIAN KENNY: So, how does a leader go in and get people to have collective courage? You talk about collective courage in the case. It comes up in the book, I’m sure. How do you stoke that within an organization? RANJAY GULATI: So, let me give you an example from sports. One of the guests I had in my class many years ago now was Sir Alex Ferguson, the coach of Manchester United, the former legendary coach of Manchester United, for those who don’t know who he is. And one of the things he comments he made in class was that one of the hardest things he has to do as a coach is to take a winning team and make them come back and want to win again. So, somebody said, what do you mean? Are they lazy and complacent now they’ve won a championship? Because he won several. And that’s why in all sports, basketball, football, it’s very hard to see back-to-back championship. And he said, no, you know what happens is instead of playing to win, they start to play not to lose. They’re so fearful of losing. In sports terms, they’ll have the ball possession, but they’ll hold it in their half. They’ll defend more than play offense. And so you go into this defensive posture. So how do you unlock the organization to play offense, to look for opportunities for growth, to take calculated bets, to even walk into uncertainty because it is scary to do things that might not work, right? We want to de-risk it. We teach that stuff. Risk mitigation, risk management, we’re all about risk. Most of business is about risk. BRIAN KENNY: But back to your point about uncertainty, risk brings uncertainty. RANJAY GULATI: But they are separate ideas also. They’re adjacent, but separate ideas. How do we as leaders create the capacity in an organization to face uncertainty, to tackle the fear that is a natural correlate of that uncertainty and put the organization on a playing to win posture? That’s the leader’s challenge. How do you get them thinking upbeat? I’ll give you another example. I’m just finishing a case right now on a totally different company. It’s called Boston Scientific. BRIAN KENNY: Of course, yeah. RANJAY GULATI: Boston Scientific, in 2010, 11-odd, had done the second worst acquisition ever. They had acquired after AOL, Time Warner. Their acquisition of Guidant was the second worst acquisition, a $27 billion company. They had acquired Guidant for $28 billion. And the two together in a matter of a few years would be worth $4 or $5 billion. Massive destruction of value. So, in comes another CEO, and what is his tagline when he takes over? Winning spirit. Got to start to win again. And once you start to win again, winning is addictive. People want to win. People want to be on a winning team. You just got to give them a taste for what winning is. How do you jump start that? Yes, you need a brilliant strategy. Yes, you need to focus. Yes, you need to think about adjacencies for growth. Yes, you need to be customer obsessed. Yes, you got to figure out what are innovative ways to brand yourself in the market. But there’s an undercurrent beneath all that, which is this winning spirit. How do you get that going? BRIAN KENNY: And you mentioned that Lyft has seen some wins over the last few years. So, winning begets more winning, right? Winning gives you confidence. It makes you feel like you can do it. If you look at David Risher and what he did, are there examples in your book that you can point to that illustrate some of the things that David was able to do, examples of courage or infusing this winning spirit? RANJAY GULATI: So, you mentioned the word “confidence,” and there’s a very famous Stanford psychologist named Albert Bandura who studied something, an adjacent idea called self-efficacy, which relates to confidence. And it turns out that this idea of efficacy and confidence comes in two flavors. One is domain specific. We know our industry, we know our business, we know what we need to do. Now let’s just go do it, right? BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. RANJAY GULATI: And David saw plenty of that in spades, I’m sure. But beneath that is another generalized form of self-efficacy. It’s a can-do mindset. No matter what comes our way, no matter what curve balls come our way, no matter how many setbacks we have, we got it. We can do it. And that can-do mindset, which is this generalized form of self-efficacy, which is, if you remember Apollo 13, Eugene Kranz tells his team, they have no textbook for this. There’s no manuals for the situation. Oxygen tanks have blown up. And now you have your command module, the LEM, the lunar entry module floating towards the moon. You’re going to use it as a life raft and slingshot their way back to earth. No one even simulated that idea. What does he say in his first meeting? Failure is not an option. Because people are like, oh my God, can’t do it, impossible, hopeless. So, how do you as a leader imbue in your team? Failure is not an option. We’ll have setbacks. We’ll make mistakes. BRIAN KENNY: But let me ask you this. When you say failure is not an option, one of the things we’ve talked about many times on Cold Call with different cases is that you have to allow for failure. You have to create a culture where failure is acceptable so that people are willing to take a chance to innovate in some way. RANJAY GULATI: Absolutely. Great observation. And so, you’re right, idea here is ultimate failure is not an option. BRIAN KENNY: Got it. RANJAY GULATI: But along the way, and you’re right, as we know about making it safe to fail and learning from that failure is critical to the journey of courage. And what is interesting about this, I’ll give you a nuanced idea that I also talk about in the book, is if you look at some of these leaders, including David Risher, I would imagine, how do you not only make it safe to fail, but how do you also deal with success? Because success itself can be complacency inducing. BRIAN KENNY: Right. RANJAY GULATI: So, I think that is the challenge David is going to have now, now that they have some wins under their belt. That’s why you have people who fade away as athletes, just a taste of success and they’re like, OK, I’m done. And you know when I learned that was actually, I wrote a case and I talk about him in the book is Nick Saban, who’s the legendary coach of the University of Alabama football team. BRIAN KENNY: Of course, yeah. RANJAY GULATI: For those who don’t know him, this guy was unprecedented in terms of his record, everything else. And he has this model he called the process. It’s actually very Eastern spiritual in some ways. He wouldn’t say that. But because the idea is focused on the process, not on the outcome. And he learned that when he was coach at Michigan State and he was about to play Ohio State, which was much better team than theirs. And he went up and met a psychologist in the psych department and said, “I want to know how can I coach my team?” And the gentleman told him, he said, “Listen, just make them focus on each play, not on the score.” At halftime, they were way behind. At halftime, he called the team and said, “Don’t forget what I said to you. Don’t look at the score.” Miraculous turnaround, came and beat Ohio State. So that stayed with him. Losing and winning can confuse and distract you. So, at one level, you are intensely focused on winning, at another, you’re not letting it cloud your thinking. And I’ll share a small other example is Scottie Scheffler, golfer, you would know. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. RANJAY GULATI: He was paired up with Tiger Woods at the Masters. On the 12th hole, which is the par three, Tiger hit a 10. He had two balls in the water. It’s one of the lowest scores ever on that hole. He was immediately out of contention of the tournament, and Scheffler was shocked. But the next five holes, Tiger birdied them. It was like nothing had ever happened. Nothing had happened. So how do you face up to failure? How do you face up to fear? I think athletics, sports, there’s a lot of metaphor and real visual stories about that. BRIAN KENNY: Right, of course. RANJAY GULATI: I think for David coming into the job, I think before you get to strategy, he had this one idea. He put it out there and said, jumpstart guys, we can do it. Build up some confidence, self-confidence. We can do it. I think the hardest thing was to help them come out of this malaise where they were just lost. But having a one-off idea is not going to do it. Then you’ve got to build a strategy. So, for him, the next thing or piece of the puzzle was, what’s going to be our strategy? Everyone wants to have clear direction. Then how do you build conviction around that direction? At the same time, you’re doing all this you’re trying to jumpstart and revive your culture to be more performance and results and outcome focused. While you’re doing this with your, you’re trying to also focus on your brand and think about customers. How do customers experience you? A lot of times companies, his idea of customer obsession is also an important piece of the puzzle to think about. To me, what’s surprising from an earlier era of research I had done on customer-centric organizations, it’s fascinating how quickly companies, organizations, forget about their customer. Customers become an abstraction, a data point, a number, a market segment. You’re not thinking tangibly about customers. And in the case of a two-sided marketplace, which is what Lyft is, their customers are both the drivers and the passengers, and they don’t both always want the same thing. BRIAN KENNY: Of course, yeah. Yeah. RANJAY GULATI: So how do you really build a customer obsession? So, your strategy, your culture, your actions, your winning is all connected to this thought process of customer obsession. So, I mentioned to you three things that David said he brought to the table. First was innovation, got to get the innovation engine going with a winning spirit. Second was customer obsession. Start thinking about our customers, both sides of them. And then the third one was frugality. In a market that is getting commoditized fast, and you don’t have scale advantage, which is what Uber has over them, you got to find a way to be frugal. BRIAN KENNY: Right. RANJAY GULATI: Organizations struggle to subtract. And I think his frugality thinking is a way to understand that where should Lyft subtract so that they can add also. So, you’re playing addition, subtraction. How do you undertake both simultaneously? BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. I would imagine the overarching situation that any leader faces stepping into that kind of a role is how hard do I push? How do I balance all the things we’re trying to do so that the organization can withstand what we’re doing? RANJAY GULATI: Pacing change is another, you’ve now- BRIAN KENNY: You could write a whole book about that. RANJAY GULATI: Yeah, that’s a whole different topic, but I think it’s such a critical one. So, I think it’s really important to keep in mind that pacing change is the other piece of the puzzle. Building capacity to enact those changes. You can’t push it too fast, but you can’t push it too slow. So how do you pace that change coming in becomes very, very important. You need to build momentum, and this positive momentum becomes another key part of the puzzle. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, yeah. Ranjay, this has been a great, you’ve given me a lot to think about, great conversation as I knew it would be. I’ve got one question for you before we end our conversation, which is simply, if you’d like our listeners to remember one thing about the Lyft case and about David Risher, what would it be? RANJAY GULATI: Courage is a source of competitive advantage. It is going to be the currency in times of uncertainty, because courage allows you to lean into that uncertainty and the fear that comes with it. It allows us to become comfortable with uncertainty. It allows us to, as you’ve heard many times from me in our conversation before, it’s okay with being scared. How do we learn to live with fear and make it a partner and a source of energy rather than want to freeze up? BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. I love that. Ranjay, your new book is, How to Be Bold: The Surprising Science of Everyday Courage. Thanks for joining me. RANJAY GULATI: Thank you very much, Brian. As always, it was lovely to talk to you.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Ad fraud hasn’t gone away – it’s getting more widespread with AI
URL: http://digiday.com/media-buying/ad-tech-briefing-ad-fraud-hasnt-gone-away-its-getting-more-widespread-with-ai/
Time Published: 2025-09-16T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → First off, few readers will need reminding how the remedies phase of Google’s ad tech trial kicks off next week. After the widespread disappointment of the earlier ruling in the parallel search trial, Digiday wants your opinion on what the most likely opinion will be, so please share your opinion in a quick poll here – it will take less than a minute of your time. That brings us to the topic of ad fraud, an activity that came to mainstream attention with news of convictions for such activity in the early 2020s. However, as today’s report from cybersecurity firm HUMAN shows, it’s not a problem that’s gone away. Earlier today, it disclosed details of what it characterizes as one of the more sophisticated mobile ad fraud operations uncovered to date. The scheme, dubbed “SlopAds,” relied on hundreds of apps distributed via Google Play and generated billions of fraudulent bid requests before its takedown, with the firm unable to share estimates of how much it cost advertisers. The latest SlopAds investigation involved at least 224 apps collectively downloaded more than 38 million times across 228 countries, with much of this activity originating in the United States, India and Brazil, per the company. At its height, the network generated an estimated 2.3 billion daily bid requests, according to HUMAN’s technical report, with the “Slop” moniker reflecting both the mass-produced nature of the apps and their recurring AI-themed branding, a veneer that belied the underlying mechanics. An extensive infrastructure of command-and-control servers and promotional domains supported the apps. SlopAds went beyond conventional click fraud. Once downloaded, the apps performed checks to avoid detection, distinguishing between organic and non-organic installs. Fraudulent behavior only triggered if an app had been downloaded after a user clicked on an ad. In practice, that meant the app behaved benignly for users who installed it directly, but activated hidden modules for those who arrived via ads. The fraud module, dubbed FatModule, was delivered through digital steganography. Four PNG image files concealed fragments of code that, when reassembled on a device, executed the fraud logic. The apps also deployed anti-analysis techniques such as debugging checks, string encryption and packed native code. From there, the operation relied on hidden WebViews, stripped-down browsers that collected device data and navigated to “cashout” domains controlled by the threat actors. These WebViews rendered ads and auto-clicked them, with repeated redirects sanitizing referral data to simulate legitimate traffic. In some cases, the fraud targeted HTML5 game and news websites, echoing tactics seen in other operations like BADBOX 2.0. HUMAN described SlopAds’ use of attribution and measurement tools as a novel obfuscation tactic. By piggybacking on attribution tags, the apps could confirm whether an install was organic or not without writing custom tools. In an email exchange, Lindsay Kaye, vp of threat intelligence, HUMAN, told Digiday the technique did not involve compromising SDKs. Instead, the bad actors involved leveraged attribution, highlighting how legitimate systems can be co-opted. Asked whether buyers should question the reliability of attribution platforms, Kaye replied, “The exploitation of the attribution system by SlopAds was not done in such a way that it should make buyers question the reliability of the tool. Rather, the threat actors used it in its intended fashion.” As for which sell-side or demand-side platforms were most exposed, HUMAN declined to disclose details, although Kaye claimed media teams should encourage partners in their ad tech supply chain to use more sophisticated tools to detect invalid traffic. Google removed all identified SlopAds apps from its Play Store, according to HUMAN, with Android’s Play Protect security service now blocking apps exhibiting similar behaviors, although it claimed the scheme involved tens of millions of downloads before removal. “HUMAN not only provides this filtration, but also surfaces granular insights into specific supply that may indicate quality concerns,” added Kaye. HUMAN researchers said they expect the operators of SlopAds to adapt and redeploy, given the investment in infrastructure and indications that they were testing new apps even during the investigation. The company said it continues to monitor for further activity. The broader takeaway for advertisers is that fraud tactics are increasingly conditional, sophisticated and difficult to distinguish from legitimate traffic. SlopAds shows that threat actors are willing to borrow tools from the legitimate ad tech stack — from attribution to steganography — to cloak their operations. For buyers, this raises questions not just about fraud detection, but about how much confidence to place in the signals underpinning programmatic decisions. While HUMAN clients were insulated, industry-wide exposure remains unclear, underscoring the asymmetry of information between security vendors and buyers. As fraudsters adapt, the SlopAds case highlights a familiar but intensifying theme: programmatic buying remains an attractive target, and bad actors are hiding in plain sight as AI slop becomes more commonplace. ‘Quite frankly, ignorant’: Index Exchange CEO Andrew Casale rebukes The Trade Desk’s SSP ‘reseller’ tag The Trade Desk’s reclassification of all supply-side platforms as “resellers” faces pushback from major players like Index Exchange, who call it an oversimplification. This reclassification penalizes SSPs by scoring their inventory as less efficient, diverting ad spend to The Trade Desk’s direct supply paths. While aiming to cut inefficiencies, critics argue it consolidates The Trade Desk’s control, reducing money for some SSPs and publishers, though others benefit from favored integrations like OpenPath. This shift is reshaping industry dynamics. Netflix turns to Amazon to make its ads easier to buy Netflix will sell ads via Amazon’s DSP in 12 markets, completing programmatic integration. Amazon’s commerce data offers advertisers unique targeting power, while discounted fees strengthen its appeal. The move helps Netflix ease buying and boost performance, as Amazon positions itself as the central hub of streaming’s growing ad economy. “This is actually going to be a problem for second-tier demand-side platforms. As ‘open web’ declines, you need to get in with the ‘hedged gardens.’” – An anonymous source reacts to news that “Netflix turns to Amazon to make its ads easier to buy.” A development that had a calamitous impact on The Trade Desk’s stock price. What’s next for Streamr.ai now that it’s been acquired by Magnite? Magnite announced it had acquired Streamr.ai, which specializes in developing AI-generated assets for small businesses to use in their CTV campaigns. Magnite CPO Adam Soroca explains more to AdExchanger. Scope3 lays off staff as part of shift toward agentic advertising Adweek discusses layoffs at the startup led by Brian O’Kelley. While the number of layoffs wasn’t confirmed in the piece, sources told Digiday the number was close to 20%, with the cuts impacting multiple departments, including former senior European leadership. With GAM going direct to buyers, SPO is the new normal Adexchanger riffs on an earlier story by The Information, looking at Google’s sell-side business, a.k.a. Google Ad Manager, pursuit of direct deals with the buy side – the implication being that demand-side platforms, including Google’s own DV360, would be cut out. GAM representatives recently hosted a dinner for top ad agencies in New York City in July to discuss ways that GAM could work directly with buyers. Is Google preparing to make Its ad tech biz independent? Emarketer’s analyst team does likewise, instead explaining how Google’s preparations reflect regulatory pressure following Judge Brinkema’s April ruling that it holds an illegal monopoly over publisher ad servers and ad exchanges. Regulators might force Google to divest GAM or sell its AdX exchange to increase competition. Despite a 7% revenue decline in network revenue, Google remains dominant with $205 billion forecasted ad revenues for 2025, but its slowed growth and antitrust challenges threaten industry dynamics and competitors. Beginning next year, Best Buy will offer “takeover packages” to allow advertisers to appear throughout the in-store shopping experience. The deal comes a week after Amazon announced a similar deal with Netflix, causing the stock price of rival DSP The Trade Desk to falter. The platform is rolling out broadly to both agencies and small- and mid-sized businesses that are looking to control more of their media investment destiny.

Hi OP, Is this prescription glass or normal? Is prescription glass additional cost? F @the eyewear guy would be great for this to be answered Price is for the nom prescription model. Lenses are additional. We don’t have any further info about the prescription lenses available in these meta until 23rd September. Zukko bought oakley? Meta acquired nearly 3% of EssilorLuxottica, which is the parent company of both Ray-Ban and Oakley. Big difference between the gen1 rayban meta compared to gen2. The tech will evolve rapidly with meta onboard I think. Launches 23/9? I've already had mine nearly 3 weeks - bought from Meta site…. that's the limited edition version that only comes in 1 colourway, I think? which is of course only limited to sunglass version No - I got the black with transition lenses delivered 3 weeks ago yesterday Which of these have the HUD in one eye? Seems like it's just the regular Glasses style that already existed. What's new if anything about this? Oakley META frames are the smart-enabled version of Oakley’s everyday frame. They incl Bluetooth audio, voice controls, and touch controls, but do not have integrated HUD or any display in the lens. Oakley’s previous “HUD” product was the now discontinued Oakley Airwave (for snow goggles), not the META line. So the answer is: none of the Oakley META glasses have a HUD in one eye. They’re audio-smart glasses only. Will you be stocking the Gen 2 Ray-Ban Wayfarers? Particularly the Limited Edition Translucent….. Hi there, as of yesterday I have access to all the Rayban Meta Gen 2 EXCEPT the clear one. the clear one will be an Rayban website online only exclusive colour.

Title: Google owner reveals £5bn AI investment in UK ahead of Trump visit

Time Published: 2025-09-16T05:12:57Z
Full Content:
The world's fourth-biggest company, Google owner Alphabet, has announced a £5bn ($6.8bn) investment in UK artificial intelligence (AI). The money will be used for infrastructure and scientific research over the next two years - the first of several massive US investments being unveiled ahead of US President Donald Trump's state visit. Google's president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat told BBC News in an exclusive interview there were "profound opportunities in the UK" for its "pioneering work in advanced science". The company will officially open a $1bn (£735m) data centre in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves on Tuesday. The investment will expand this site and also include funding for London-based DeepMind, run by British Nobel Prize winner Sir Demis Hassabis, which deploys AI to revolutionise advanced scientific research. Ms Porat said there was "now a US-UK special technology relationship... there's downside risks that we need to work on together to mitigate, but there's also tremendous opportunity in economic growth, in social services, advancing science". She pointed to the government's AI Opportunities Action Plan as helping the investment, but said "there's still work to be done to land that", and that capturing the upside of the AI boom "was not a foregone conclusion". Reeves said the investment was "a powerful vote of confidence in the UK economy" and showed "the strength of our partnership with the US". The US administration had pressed the UK to water down its Digital Services Tax on companies, including Google, in talks this year, but it is not expected to feature in this week's announcements. Further multi-billion-dollar UK investments are expected from US giants over the next 24 hours. The pound has strengthened, analysts say, partly on expectations of interest rate changes and a flow of US investment. On Monday, Google's owner Alphabet became the fourth company to be worth more than $3 trillion in terms of total stock market value, joining other technology giants Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple. Google's share price has surged in the past month after US courts decided not to order the breakup of the company. Google CEO Sundar Pichai had succeeded in making the company an "AI First" business, with Ms Porat saying, "it's that performance which has resulted in that metric". Until this summer, Google had been seen to have lagged behind startups such as OpenAI, despite having pioneered much of the key research behind large language models. Across the world, there has been some concern about the energy use and environmental impact of data centres. Ms Porat said that the facility would be air-cooled rather than water-cooled and the heat "captured and redeployed to heat schools and homes". Google has also signed a deal with Shell to supply "95% carbon-free energy" for its UK investments. In the US, the Trump administration has suggested that the power needs of AI data centres require a return to the use of carbon-intensive energy sources. Ms Porat said that Google remained committed to building renewable energy, but "obviously wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine every hour of the day". Energy efficiency was being built into "all aspects of AI" microchips, models, and data centres, but it was important to "modernise the grid" to balance off periods of excess capacity, she said. Asked about fears of an AI-induced graduate jobs crisis, Ms Porat also said that her company was "spending a lot of time" focused on the AI jobs challenge. "It would be naive to assume that there isn't a downside. If companies just use AI to find efficiencies, we're not going to see the upside to the UK economy or any economy." But, she said, entire new industries were being created, opening new doors, and in jobs such as nursing and radiology, adding: "AI is collaborating with people rather than replacing them. "Each one of us needs to start using AI so you can understand how it can be an assistance to what you're doing, as opposed to actually fearing it and watching from the sidelines," she said. Prosecutors have broadly outlined suspect Tyler Robinson's political views - but many questions remain. The president plans to meet Xi at a global summit in South Korea next month and will travel to China next year. US President Donald Trump suggested the military could help tackle illegal migration to the UK. America's leading late-night TV hosts lament Jimmy Kimmel's suspension as a "blatant assault on freedom of speech".

Title: Google-owner reveals £5bn AI investment in UK ahead of Trump visit
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmek723dz9o
Time Published: 2025-09-16T04:00:15Z
Full Content:
The world's fourth-biggest company, Google owner Alphabet, has announced a £5bn ($6.8bn) investment in UK artificial intelligence (AI). The money will be used for infrastructure and scientific research over the next two years - the first of several massive US investments being unveiled ahead of US President Donald Trump's state visit. Google's president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat told BBC News in an exclusive interview there were "profound opportunities in the UK" for its "pioneering work in advanced science". The company will officially open a $1bn (£735m) data centre in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves on Tuesday. The investment will expand this site and also include funding for London-based DeepMind, run by British Nobel Prize winner Sir Demis Hassabis, which deploys AI to revolutionise advanced scientific research. Ms Porat said there was "now a US-UK special technology relationship... there's downside risks that we need to work on together to mitigate, but there's also tremendous opportunity in economic growth, in social services, advancing science". She pointed to the government's AI Opportunities Action Plan as helping the investment, but said "there's still work to be done to land that", and that capturing the upside of the AI boom "was not a foregone conclusion". Reeves said the investment was "a powerful vote of confidence in the UK economy" and showed "the strength of our partnership with the US". The US administration had pressed the UK to water down its Digital Services Tax on companies, including Google, in talks this year, but it is not expected to feature in this week's announcements. Further multi-billion-dollar UK investments are expected from US giants over the next 24 hours. The pound has strengthened, analysts say, partly on expectations of interest rate changes and a flow of US investment. On Monday, Google's owner Alphabet became the fourth company to be worth more than $3 trillion in terms of total stock market value, joining other technology giants Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple. Google's share price has surged in the past month after US courts decided not to order the breakup of the company. Google CEO Sundar Pichai had succeeded in making the company an "AI First" business, with Ms Porat saying, "it's that performance which has resulted in that metric". Until this summer, Google had been seen to have lagged behind startups such as OpenAI, despite having pioneered much of the key research behind large language models. Across the world, there has been some concern about the energy use and environmental impact of data centres. Ms Porat said that the facility would be air-cooled rather than water-cooled and the heat "captured and redeployed to heat schools and homes". Google has also signed a deal with Shell to supply "95% carbon-free energy" for its UK investments. In the US, the Trump administration has suggested that the power needs of AI data centres require a return to the use of carbon-intensive energy sources. Ms Porat said that Google remained committed to building renewable energy, but "obviously wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine every hour of the day". Energy efficiency was being built into "all aspects of AI" microchips, models, and data centres, but it was important to "modernise the grid" to balance off periods of excess capacity, she said. Asked about fears of an AI-induced graduate jobs crisis, Ms Porat also said that her company was "spending a lot of time" focused on the AI jobs challenge. "It would be naive to assume that there isn't a downside. If companies just use AI to find efficiencies, we're not going to see the upside to the UK economy or any economy." But, she said, entire new industries were being created, opening new doors, and in jobs such as nursing and radiology, adding: "AI is collaborating with people rather than replacing them. "Each one of us needs to start using AI so you can understand how it can be an assistance to what you're doing, as opposed to actually fearing it and watching from the sidelines," she said. A US federal judge took issue with the contents of Trump's lawsuit against the newspaper and gave him 28 days to amend it. US President Donald Trump suggested the military could help tackle illegal migration to the UK. Prosecutors have broadly outlined suspect Tyler Robinson's political views - but many questions remain. The president hailed "progress" during a phone call with Xi and said that he also would travel to China next year.

Title: Google parent company Alphabet valued at $3 trillion for first time

15.09.2025, 20:57 Uhr A jump in the share price of the Google parent company Alphabet on Monday saw its value on the New York stock market rise above $3 trillion for the first time. Alphabet's A shares recently rose by around 4% to $252 on Wall Street. This made them one of the strongest performers in the Nasdaq 100 technology index. By breaking through the three-trillion-dollar mark, the A and C shares of Google's parent company crowned their rally since the beginning of April, when the A shares were only trading at around $145. The shares have gained almost 60% in the past year. This makes Alphabet the fourth most expensive company on the US stock market. Only tech giants Apple, Microsoft and â as the most valuable company â chipmaker NVIDIA, which is benefiting from the artificial intelligence boom, have a higher market valuation. Analysts see room for further price gains at Alphabet. The trigger for the recent rise was the US bank Citigroup raising its price target for A shares from $225 to $280. Alphabet, along with Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Facebook's parent company Meta, Amazon and Tesla, is one of the "Magnificent Seven" companies listed on the US stock market. The tech giants set the pace for global stock markets and carry significant weight in index funds (ETFs) such as the MSCI World or the S&P 500, which are popular with private investors. powered by dpa-newslab | Legal Notice | About Us / Contact | Privacy

Title: 2025-26 Fantasy Basketball Rankings: PG/SG draft tiers

Manage your account ... The 2025-26 NBA season is almost here, and with it comes my position-by-position fantasy basketball tiers, starting with the guards. This guide is points-league focused but includes insights for category formats as well. [Join or create a fantasy basketball league for the 2025-26 NBA season] Let's kick it off with two players who will drive much of the MVP conversation this season. Editor's note: Players are listed based on their primary position from last season or projected role this year. [Dan Titus' Draft Tiers: PG/SG | SF/PF | C] Luka Dončić, Los Angeles Lakers Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City Thunder Luka Dončić: Luka enters his first full Lakers season healthy and in shape, ready to deliver close to a nightly 30-point triple-double. Even in a down year, he dropped 28-8-8. His blend of usage, shot volume and all-around production makes him one of the safest fantasy picks available. With efficiency improvements and better conditioning, he could push for a top-three finish across formats. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander: SGA and Luka were the only guards to average over 50 FPPG last season. After a legendary season finishing as the scoring leader, MVP, Finals MVP and champion, SGA's floor is top five across all formats. Anthony Edwards, Minnesota Timberwolves Cade Cunningham, Detroit Pistons Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks Devin Booker, Phoenix Suns Tyrese Maxey, Philadelphia 76ers James Harden, Los Angeles Clippers Anthony Edwards: Edwards continues his ascent as Minnesota’s offensive centerpiece, combining highlight-reel finishes with steady statistical growth. His scoring is already elite, but his rebounds and assists have begun to rise, too. With another leap in efficiency, Edwards could join Tier 1 next season. Cade Cunningham: There's a chance Cunningham can sneak into the elites. He averaged 48 FPPG last season, so another leap forward for him and the Pistons in a weaker Eastern Conference can push him into 50 FPPG territory. Devin Booker: The only thing preventing Booker from being a savage offensively is a possible late-season tank. I don't see it happening, so expect Booker to put up top-tier points and assist numbers. Trae Young: Trae’s elite assists and scoring floor make him one of the best points-league guards. Turnovers and poor shooting don’t impact his value as much, so bank on him being one of the few players getting at least 24 points and 10 assists a night. Tyrese Maxey: I'm higher on Maxey than the consensus. Maxey posted the sixth-most FPPG among guards last year. Those numbers are going up with Joel Embiid and Paul George undoubtedly missing games. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors De’Aaron Fox, San Antonio Spurs Jalen Brunson, New York Knicks LaMelo Ball, Charlotte Hornets Donovan Mitchell, Cleveland Cavaliers Stephen Curry: I'd draft Curry higher in category leagues than points because his 3s and high FT% are more statistically relevant. Still, he'll likely be a top-10 scorer in the NBA who also generates enough counting stats elsewhere to warrant an early pick in points leagues. De’Aaron Fox: Fox gets a full offseason to prepare to play with Victor Wembanyama, so an uptick in assists as the primary creator elevates his value. He finished in the top 10 in FPPG among guards last season, averaging 41 FPPG. Jalen Brunson: The engine for the Knicks has one of the safest floors for a guard. He'll likely go in the first three rounds of drafts, but be aware that the minutes are likely to dip under new HC Mike Brown. LaMelo Ball: Injuries always hold him back, and it's reflected in his ADP. When healthy, though, Ball is capable of being a top-10 scorer amongst guards in FPPG. Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies Tyler Herro, Miami Heat Josh Giddey, Chicago Bulls Jamal Murray, Denver Nuggets Amen Thompson, Houston Rockets Desmond Bane, Orlando Magic Derrick White, Boston Celtics Brandon Miller, Charlotte Hornets Ja Morant: Few guards are as explosive as Morant, capable of putting up 25/7/5 lines on any given night. The risk is obvious — injuries and off-court issues — but the reward is massive if he plays 65+ games. He’s a swing pick with league-winning upside. He's way better for points formats since you can ignore the poor FT shooting, turnovers and lack of 3s. Josh Giddey: He inked a new contract, plus was one of three players to average at least 8.0 rebounds and 7.0 assists per game last year. The other two? Luka and Nikola Jokić. Giddey can push for over 40 FPPG this year. Amen Thompson: With Jalen Green gone, Thompson steps into a bigger role in Houston’s offense. His rebounding and defensive stocks make him an unusual fantasy guard with multi-category upside. If his jumper stabilizes, it'll more than justify a third-round selection, even for points leagues. Desmond Bane: Bane is a solid 30-35 FPPG scorer, but he'll be in a new environment, playing alongside Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner. I prefer Bane in category leagues, but he'll have the counting stats to warrant a pick around the fourth or fifth round. Jalen Green, Phoenix Suns Cam Thomas, Brooklyn Nets Darius Garland, Cleveland Cavaliers Austin Reaves, Los Angeles Lakers Jordan Poole, New Orleans Pelicans Zach LaVine, Sacramento Kings Dyson Daniels, Atlanta Hawks Coby White, Chicago Bulls Fred VanVleet, Houston Rockets Anfernee Simons, Boston Celtics Jalen Green: Green gets a huge bump after getting traded to the Suns. Volume is king for points leagues and he'll get plenty of opportunities as the secondary option to Booker. He's much better for points than category leagues. Cam Thomas: Thomas still hasn't signed his qualifying offer with the Nets. We'll have to wait and see how long his contract situation plays out. Thomas and Michael Porter Jr. are going to have a ton of scoring opportunities playing for Brooklyn. Darius Garland: Garland should be a tier higher, but he underwent surgery on his toe in June with a recovery timeline of 4-5 months. I don't expect to see him in uniform until November. When fully healthy, he should average north of 35 FPPG. Dyson Daniels: The NBA's Most Improved Player took a massive step forward last season. However, Jalen Johnson was hurt for the majority of the season, and the team wasn't as equipped as it is now. I'm expecting some regression despite Daniels averaging 37 FPPG in 2024-25. Fred VanVleet: FVV loses value in points leagues because his 3s, steals and FT% don't carry as much weight. Still, he's a useful PG capable of putting up at least 30 FPPG. Immanuel Quickley, Toronto Raptors Andrew Nembhard, Indiana Pacers Jalen Suggs, Orlando Mag Payton Pritchard, Boston Celtics CJ McCollum, Washington Wizards Bennedict Mathurin, Indiana Pacers Norman Powell, Miami Heat Bradley Beal, Los Angeles Clippers Shaedon Sharpe, Portland Trail Blazers Christian Braun, Denver Nuggets Immanuel Quickley: Quickley is looking to bounce back from an injury-riddled campaign. He averaged 31 FPPG when he played, so it's something to build off of playing with Scottie Barnes, Brandon Ingram and Jakob Poeltl. Andrew Nembhard: Nembhard is one of my favorite breakout candidates with Tyrese Haliburton being ruled out for the season. His skill set fits better with category leagues, but I'd also consider getting shares in points leagues. CJ McCollum: McCollum's ADP is just outside the top 100 over the past seven days on Yahoo. He's becoming a value, especially for points leagues. I think he'll play a lot of minutes for the Wizards until a mid-season trade likely sends him to a contender. Shaedon Sharpe: Sharpe’s athleticism pops every night, and he’s starting to find consistency as a scorer. Portland is giving him freedom to develop, which means more usage. He's on the verge of becoming a 20-point scorer in this League. Kevin Porter Jr., Milwaukee Bucks Keyonte George, Utah Jazz D’Angelo Russell, Dallas Mavericks Jaden Ivey, Detroit Pistons Stephon Castle, San Antonio Spurs Brandin Podziemski, Golden State Warriors Ayo Dosunmu, Chicago Bulls Davion Mitchell, Miami Heat Isaiah Collier, Utah Jazz Quentin Grimes, Philadelphia 76ers Malik Monk, Sacramento Kings Keyonte George: George had growing pains last year, but his court vision and scoring style — reminiscent of Jordan Clarkson — make him worth the gamble. If his efficiency stabilizes, he could jump to Tier 6 quickly. Brandin Podziemski: Podziemski is one of the rare guards who rebounds like a forward. Golden State trusts him with meaningful minutes, which ensures a solid floor. If Curry misses time, his value skyrockets. Stephon Castle: Castle will start at SG and offers some nice counting-stat potential heading into his second NBA season. He's a better asset for points leagues because his efficiency and lack of 3s remain an issue. Davion Mitchell: Once he was traded to the Heat last year, he was finally able to carve out a meaningful role. His defense is infectious and he looked far more comfortable shooting the ball and acting as a primary facilitator than he did with the Kings and Raptors. He's one of my sleepers whom I'll be selecting in the later rounds of drafts. Scoot Henderson, Portland Trail Blazers Cason Wallace, Oklahoma City Thunder Jared McCain, Philadelphia 76ers Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Atlanta Hawks Reed Sheppard, Houston Rockets Tre Johnson, Washington Wizards Anthony Black, Orlando Magic VJ Edgecombe, Philadelphia 76ers Rob Dillingham, Minnesota Timberwolves Bub Carrington, Washington Wizards Scoot Henderson: Henderson’s early career journey has been volatile. Bringing in Jrue Holiday likely puts him back on the bench. Perhaps a sixth-man role could pan out. Either way, he's better for points leagues than category if he continues getting 27 minutes a night. Cason Wallace: Wallace thrives as a low-mistake, high-efficiency rotation guard. OKC trusts him in high-leverage minutes, which locks in his role. I think we'll see his role expand this season, making him a fantasy asset in more category leagues than points leagues. Tre Johnson: Outside of Cooper Flagg, Johnson has a legitimate shot at Rookie of the Year. The injury to Bilal Coulibaly should expedite his fantasy impact as well. Rob Dillingham: The second-year guard looked great at Summer League. Mike Conley is getting older and Nickeil Alexander-Walker left in free agency, so they'll need Dillingham's speed and scoring punch off the bench. He's a bucket who will emerge as a points league guy this year. Russell Westbrook III, Free agent Donte DiVincenzo, Minnesota Timberwolves T.J. McConnell, Indiana Pacers Chris Paul, Los Angeles Clippers Jrue Holiday, Portland Trail Blazers Klay Thompson, Dallas Mavericks Collin Sexton, Charlotte Hornets Alex Caruso, Oklahoma City Thunder Caris LeVert, Detroit Pistons

Title: MSFT Stock Analysis: Is Microsoft Stock A Buy At $510?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Microsoft's stock (NASDAQ: MSFT) has climbed over 30% in the past six months, driven by strong quarterly results marked by improving revenue growth and expanding margins. However, with the stock now trading at 37 times its trailing earnings, the key question for investors is whether MSFT is still worth buying. We believe MSFT stock currently looks expensive due to its elevated valuation. Our view is based on a detailed analysis comparing the stock’s current valuation to its recent operating performance and its overall financial position, both current and historical. While Microsoft shows strong operational and financial performance, these strengths already seem priced into its lofty valuation, as outlined below. That said, if you’re looking for upside potential with lower volatility than holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—delivering returns of over 91% since inception. Separately, see – S&P 500 Set To Surge 30%?

While Azure’s growth could convince some investors that an even higher multiple is justified, we think from a risk standpoint it’s better to wait for a price pullback before buying MSFT. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring 30 stocks, has a consistent track record of outperforming its benchmark, which includes the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap. Why? HQ Portfolio stocks deliver stronger returns with lower risk versus the benchmark—less of a roller-coaster ride, as seen in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: The consulting industry is on track to get upended, and we'll all have to deal with the consequences

Welcome back! The older you get, the tougher it can be to bounce back from the weekend. But if Sam Altman's startup gets its way, aging doesn't necessarily mean decline. BI's Hilary Brueck looked at how Retro Biosciences is developing a pill to clear out the "gunk" in your brain. In today's big story, the consulting industry is on the cusp of a big overhaul, and the rest of the business world is likely to feel it. What's on deck: Markets: Forget equity, this hedge fund just wants a cut of revenue from the tech companies it backs. Tech: It's tech news, but treat it like a spectator sport. Why people love "TBPN." Business: A Real Housewives star and former Netflix exec walks us through her daily routine. But first, the synergies are no longer synergizing. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. A key pipeline for funneling talent into white-collar work has sprung a big leak that won't be easy to fix. A combination of AI, shifting customer demands, and tougher paths to promotions means the consulting industry is on the cusp of being completely reshaped, writes Business Insider's Jennifer Sor. Consultants are no strangers to volatility. In fact, a big part of their business is advising clients on the best ways to navigate change. But the current trends giving consultants plenty of work — operating more slimmed-down workforces and leveraging AI — are also impacting their own ranks. Analysts told Jennifer that the end result isn't clear, but early signs point to a tightening of senior and junior roles in the industry. BI's Polly Thompson, our resident consulting expert, has extensively reported on these trends. PwC, for example, plans to cut college graduate hiring over the next three years, with AI cited as a primary reason. That's also trickling upward as senior employees head for the exits, with several unhappy about dwindling pay and a shrinking window to reach the profession's pinnacle: partner. The rest of the business world will likely feel the effects of an upheaval within consulting. Love them or hate them, consultants are undeniably a part of the fabric of corporate America. One direct impact is the work they do with clients across the globe. Got a big business decision to make? Chances are you're going to bring in a consultant for some advice. As those firms reshape themselves, the way companies interact with, or even pay for, consultants could change. But it goes beyond that. Consulting often represents young people's foot in the white-collar workforce door. Work on a project for a few years for a client and then eventually go in-house. As the number of junior consultants dwindles, that could disrupt how countless companies stock their ranks. Those converts can also go on to do big things. Sheryl Sandberg, Sundar Pichai, and Jamie Dimon are just a few examples of high-profile consulting alums. But if anyone is well-suited to navigate a quickly moving landscape, it's consultants. After all, that's what the rest of us all pay them so much for. And if all else fails, they could always hire … a consultant. Commercial real estate is going Hollywood. You've heard of "Selling Sunset." Now get ready for "The Real Estate Commission," A&E's upcoming show about the epic highs and lows of being a commercial real estate dealmaker. Its star, Todd Drowlette, gave BI a behind-the-scenes look at the first season. A new fund wants to give tech companies the royal(ty) treatment. Althera42 wants to invest in Europe's digital infrastructure, like data centers and cloud computing, with a slight twist. Instead of getting equity, Althera42 provides capital upfront for a fixed percentage of future revenues. The idea is to bring the investing playbook behind music royalties to tech. Beware of the gigantic price bubble. David Rosenberg, founder of Rosenberg Research and a stock-market bear, warns of negative S&P 500 returns due to high valuations. The Shiller CAPE is at its third-highest level of all time. That's not the only reason Rosenberg is skeptical. Want to become fluent in tech bro? Watch "TBPN." For three hours, five days a week, hosts John Coogan and Jordi Hays of the online show Technology Business Programming discuss tech industry drama like a spectator sport and chat with investors, founders, and sometimes journalists. BI's Julia Hornstein tuned in for a week to understand why it's become a must-watch for the chronically online tech crowd. Polymarket is about to cash in on a US expansion. The betting site, known for predicting Trump's presidential win in 2024, is raising another funding round that would sharply increase its valuation, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Investor demand has risen as Polymarket appears ready to launch in the US. Big cuts at Musk's xAI. Elon Musk's AI startup laid off at least 500 workers from its data annotation team. xAI is now prioritzing specialist AI tutors over generalists, according to multiple messages viewed by BI's Grace Kay. How Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Bozoma Saint John does it all. At 5:30 am every morning, the former Netflix CMO is already meditating and praying. For BI's Power Hour series, Saint John shared her daily routine, from running a hair-care company and hosting a new Jimmy Fallon show to being a single mom. The world's richest men are buying huge media companies because they can. In 2022, Elon Musk bought what we used to call Twitter. That's what Larry Ellison is considering today by financing his son David's plan to buy Warner Bros. Discovery weeks after buying Paramount. It's unlikely anyone will stand in the way, BI's Peter Kafka writes. Breaking up is hard to do. Especially when you're trying to break up with your employer of many years. The job market is tough enough already, but those who haven't had to job search in decades face age-related biases and other unique challenges.

Title: Can Natera Stock Reach $500?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/15/can-natera-stock-reach-500/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T14:00:58Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Let's start with something remarkable. Natera (NASDAQ: NTRA) just marked its 10th anniversary as a public company, and what a journey it has been. The stock has delivered nearly 10x returns, rising from its $18 IPO price to around $170 today. Even more impressive, revenues have also expanded about 10-fold from $190 million to $2 billion. And the momentum hasn’t slowed — revenue growth over the last twelve months was a stellar 44%. So, what’s fueling this growth? It comes down to one word: intelligence — specifically, medical intelligence. Natera has placed itself at the forefront of molecular diagnostics, especially in cancer detection and monitoring. Think of them as medical detectives, helping doctors detect issues at the genomic level before they become life-threatening emergencies. The company focuses on three main areas: women’s health, oncology, and organ health. Their flagship product, Signatera, is a game-changer. This personalized tumor-informed test uses a simple blood draw to detect circulating tumor DNA and monitor for molecular residual disease across multiple cancer types, including breast, lung, ovarian, colorectal, and bladder cancers. This isn’t just an incremental improvement — it’s a revolutionary technology transforming how oncologists monitor their patients. But what makes their technology stand out? Its beauty lies in its simplicity and precision. Rather than invasive procedures, patients undergo a simple blood draw — a liquid biopsy. But this isn’t an ordinary blood test. Natera’s platform can detect tiny fragments of tumor DNA circulating in the bloodstream, offering doctors unprecedented insight into cancer progression and recurrence risk. Beyond Signatera, Natera also offers Altera for genomic profiling and Empower for hereditary cancer screening — creating a comprehensive suite that covers the entire cancer care spectrum. Before we dive into Natera stock’s specific metrics, it’s worth noting an important reality: investing in high-growth companies like Natera comes with volatility. While the upside can be significant, the ride is often bumpy. If you want high-quality growth with lower volatility than a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark — a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes — with returns exceeding 91% since inception. This diversified approach provides exposure to high-quality growth names while managing single-stock risk. On a separate note, see – What’s Happening With ABBV Stock? Now, let’s explore why Natera’s story is so compelling. Here’s where things get exciting. In the latest quarter, Natera processed over 850,000 tests, generating $546.6 million in revenue. About 22% of these tests were oncology-related, and this segment is growing at 50% year-over-year. This is the key engine driving future growth. Let’s zoom out. Cancer recurrence is every survivor’s worst fear, yet traditional monitoring often leaves patients waiting months for clarity. Nearly 19 million U.S. cancer survivors live in constant uncertainty between scans. They need better tools to track their cancer status, representing a massive market that will require sophisticated monitoring for decades to come. Now, we believe Natera can sustain 25% annual revenue growth over the next few years. That would boost revenue from about $1.7 billion last year to around $7 billion in 2030 — a 4x increase. For context, they’ve grown revenue at an average of 40% over the past three years, so 25% is actually not that aggressive. You might ask — is there room for a company this size to keep growing? Absolutely. The cell-free DNA testing market — which includes what Signatera does — is expected to almost double from $11 billion today to around $20 billion within five years. [1] Natera isn’t just riding this wave — they’re helping shape it. Consider the competition: Roche leads diagnostics with $16+ billion in revenue, followed by Danaher at $10 billion and Abbott at $9 billion. Natera’s $2 billion shows they’re still in the early innings of their growth story. The growth path breaks down into several key areas: How could $7 billion in revenue translate to a $500+ stock price? The math is compelling. If Natera hits $7 billion while maintaining its current price-to-sales multiple of 13x, the stock could reach about $700. Even with multiple compressions to 10x, that’s still well above $500. This assumes minimal dilution, which is reasonable given its cash-generation potential at scale. Yes, the company is currently loss-making, but as revenue grows, margins should turn positive. Natera’s net income margin has improved from -75% in 2021 to -13% now. Diagnostic market penetration takes time. For Natera to be valued at $50B, $100B, or even $200B (vs. $23B today), investors must think long-term — 2030 and beyond — with billions of tests processed annually worldwide. By 2035, liquid biopsies could be as routine as cholesterol tests. Still, several factors must align: Despite the opportunity, key risks remain: Natera is a genuine growth story driven by breakthrough technology addressing massive markets. It has scaled impressively while sustaining momentum that most CEOs would envy. The path to $500+ per share is mathematically feasible — but execution must be flawless. For risk-tolerant investors, this offers high growth with meaningful upside — balanced by real execution and market risks. For a more diversified approach, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio has outperformed its benchmark of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000. Its quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap names has delivered strong returns while cushioning losses in down markets (RV Portfolio metrics). The opportunity is real — the question is whether Natera can execute and whether investors can stomach the volatility for what could be a rewarding ride. 1.

Title: Solana Price Prediction: SOL Price To $500?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Solana has been on a remarkable run lately. The price of SOL has surged by about 80% over the past six months and is now trading well above all its key moving averages. This impressive performance is supported by strong momentum, including its total value locked (TVL) reaching a record $13.22 billion and a surge of institutional investment. But the big question is—what would it take for SOL to double from here and surpass the $500 mark? Let’s explore what could drive that move. That said, if you are looking for upside potential with less volatility than holding an individual stock or token, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—delivering returns of more than 91% since inception. Separately, see – XRP Price To Hit $10 In October? Explosive rallies like this may seem extreme, but they are not uncommon in the crypto space. Here are some recent examples: With these catalysts lining up, could Solana be on the brink of its next big move? We’ve discussed the upside, but what about the risks? No investment is without challenges, and Solana is no exception. Here’s what could hold it back: While the outlook seems positive, such rapid growth is never guaranteed. The crypto market is highly volatile, and success depends on Solana’s continued execution and favorable market conditions. Alternatively, consider exploring the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000 indices) to deliver strong returns. Why? The RV Portfolio’s quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks enables it to capture market gains while limiting downside in weaker conditions, as shown in the RV Portfolio performance metrics. So, can Solana really hit $500? The fundamentals are compelling. With record TVL on the network and major investors piling in, the stage is set. Catalysts like a potential ETF approval and Solana’s booming ecosystem could drive a massive rally. Still, investors should carefully weigh the risks.

Title: Executives Remain Skittish About Buying Their Own Shares
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndorfman/2025/09/15/executives-remain-skittish-about-buying-their-own-shares/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T13:15:00Z

ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. Lately, insider buys by companies’ chief executives have been scarce. Executives normally sell more shares than they buy because their cup is periodically refilled with stock-option grants. Over the past 21 years, dollar volume for buys has usually run about 34% of the volume for sales, according to Gurufocus.com. Buying has been below normal in 13 of the past 15 months. In August, buys were only 26% of sales. The highest ratio of buys to sells, 2.01, was in October 2008, when much of the country was in despair as the Great Recession rolled on. The executives who bought 17 years ago looked smart when the economy recovered in 2009. Let’s look at a few companies where insiders bought last month. Remember Eastman Kodak? You used to buy its film for your camera, if you’re old enough. Eastman Chemical Co. (EMN) was spun off from Eastman Kodak in 1994. Coating, adhesives, and specialty plastics are among its products. The chief executive officer, Mark Costa, and the chief financial officer, McLain William Thomas Jr., made sizable purchases on Aug. 27. Costa bought about $502,000 of shares, Thomas about $252,000. Several other Eastman executives bought shares the same day. The stock has fallen 24% this year, partly because Eastman is hurt by tariffs more than most companies are. It imports materials from several European countries and from Brazil and India, which are being hit with particularly high tariffs. Yet the company has shown a profit for at least 30 years in a row. The stock now sells for about nine times earnings and less than one times revenue – far below its typical multiples. I think it will recover. In August, eight Eli Lilly (LLY) executives bought Lilly shares, and two sold. Buyers included the chief executive, David Ricks, who spent just over $1 million, and the chief financial officer, Lucas Montarce, who shelled out almost $495,000. The pharmaceutical company’s shares traded as high as $942 last summer, but have come down to about $755. Apparently, Ricks and Montarce think it’s now attractively priced. I don’t. Lilly shares trade for 49 times recent earnings, more than 12 times revenue and about 37 times book value (corporate net worth per share). I think the stock, which has soared on the success of weight-loss drugs, is near-perfectly priced. Growth has slowed to a crawl at United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS), partly because of competition from Amazon.com. UPS shares have fallen more than 31% this year. The stock traded at well above $200 in 2021 but now languishes at about $84. Despite all this bad news, Carol Tome, the company’s CEO, spent just over $1 million last month to add to her UPS holdings. Two directors also bought shares in July and August. I think Tome will be rewarded. UPS has a standout return on equity, more than 34%. And the stock trades for less than 13 times earnings. At First Citizens BancShares Inc. (FCNCA), the chief executive Frank Holding Jr. spent just over $1 million last month to add to his considerable hoard of shares. Four other insiders also bought shares in August. Based in Raleigh, N.C., First Citizens is a regional bank with improving profits. I like to see banks earn a return on assets of 1.0% or better. First Citizens has cleared that hurdle in six of the past seven years. The stock looks pretty reasonable to me at 12 times recent earnings. This is the 75th column I’ve written about stocks with insider buying or selling. I can calculate results for 65 of them – all those written from 1999 through a year ago. Bad news first: Stocks I’ve recommended based on insider buying have returned an average of 8.9% in 12 months, trailing the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index over the same periods by 1.8 percentage points. Better news: Stocks I said to avoid, even though insiders were buying, have trailed the index by 24 percentage points. Stocks where I discussed sales by insiders have lagged the index by 2.3 percentage points. Stocks where I noted insider buying but made no comment, or an ambiguous comment, have beaten the index by 14.2 percentage points. Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. Disclosure: In a hedge fund I run, I own put options on Eli Lilly, betting on a decline.

Title: The world's 3 richest people are worth a combined $1 trillion — about as much as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway

The three wealthiest people on the planet are worth a combined $1 trillion, about as much as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Larry Ellison, a cofounder of Oracle, and Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, had net worths of $429 billion, $360 billion, and $269 billion as of Monday's close, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Together, they're worth $1.06 trillion, virtually matching Berkshire's market capitalization and comfortably surpassing the $800 billion-plus market values of Oracle, JPMorgan, and Walmart. It's striking that three individuals are worth as much on paper as Berkshire, a corporate behemoth that generates about $370 billion in annual revenue, employs nearly 400,000 workers, and has arguably the world's greatest living investor at its helm. Musk, Ellison, and Zuckerberg are worth so much because they're the biggest shareholders of some of the world's most valuable companies. Musk owns about 13% of Tesla and 42% of SpaceX, Ellison holds about a 41% stake in Oracle, and Zuckerberg has about a 13% stake in Meta. The trio clear the $1 trillion mark because they've hugely increased their wealth as a group. While Musk's fortune has shrunk by about $4 billion this year to date, Ellison's net worth has nearly doubled, surging by $167 billion as Oracle stock has soared over 80% since January 1. Zuckerberg's wealth has jumped by $61 billion, fueled by Meta stock's 30% gain in 2025. Most ultrawealthy people have also grown substantially richer this year. The 17 members of the $100 billion club have added a net $486 billion to their joint fortunes, boosting their combined wealth to around $3.3 trillion at Monday's close — a figure greater than the market values of Alphabet or Amazon. Musk, Ellison, and Zuckerberg have seen their fortunes balloon in recent years thanks to investor optimism around AI's potential to slash corporations' costs and supercharge their profitability. Oracle's stock price climbed as much as 43% last Wednesday alone, lifting the company's market value by nearly $300 billion at its peak, after it projected rapid revenue growth fueled by AI demand. Musk could become the world's first trillionaire with the help of a prospective Tesla pay package unveiled last week. The proposed deal would grant Musk shares worth over $1 trillion if he manages to increase his company's market value by about eightfold and hit a slew of operational targets within the next decade or so. Musk purchased about $1 billion worth of Tesla stock on Friday, signaling he likes his chances. Jump to

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Tesla stock was rising in premarket trading Monday as CEO Elon Musk gets ready for an artificial intelligence “war." Shares of the electric-vehicle maker were up 1.2% at $400.61 in early trading, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were each rising about 0.2%. The move comes after the stock rallied 13% this past week. Exactly why it rose that much is open for some debate. Technical traders became excited by the recent momentum that took Tesla past the highs reached in the Spring. EV sales were strong in August, according to industry data providers. Buyers appear to be rushing to beat the removal of the $7,500 federal EV purchase tax credit, which goes away at the end of September. Tesla has also received some approvals to begin testing its self-driving taxi service in Las Vegas. Tesla launched a small AI-trained robo-taxi service in Austin, Texas, in June. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes AI is what has investors excited. “Investors are starting to see through the near-term demand issues for Tesla and recognize that Tesla is in a pole position to be a clear leader in the autonomous market opportunity, with Robotaxis set to scale to 30 to 35 cities in the US over the next year," he wrote on Sunday. Tesla sold about 721,000 cars in the first half of 2025, down about 13% year over year. That’s the demand weakness to which Ives is referring. Selling fewer cars isn’t good news, but AI simply matters more than car sales these days. “We view this autonomous chapter as one of the most important for Musk and Tesla in its history as a company," added Ives. He calls AI a $1 trillion opportunity for the company. “Musk is driving this [AI] vision and is now in a ‘wartime CEO’ mode, which is music to the ears of Tesla bulls with this AI Arms Race happening across the tech world." The arms race might be an apt analogy. AI is driving the stock market with Magnificent Seven stocks valued at some $20 trillion. ChatGPT parent OpenAI is valued at about $500 billion, while Amazon.com, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms are spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year on AI computing. Some of that is for self-driving cars, Tesla’s territory. Amazon owns self-driving company Zoox. Alphabet controls Waymo. Ives says Musk is the right leader for Tesla at a time like this, calling him the company’s “most important asset." A new pay package, worth up to $1 trillion if all performance incentives are hit, should keep Musk at Tesla until 2030 and beyond. Ives is a Tesla bull, rating shares Buy with a $500 price target for shares, the highest on Wall Street, according to FactSet. The rest of the Street isn’t as bullish. The average analyst price target is about $318 a share, and 44% of analysts rate shares Buy. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the S&P 500 is about 55%. Coming into Monday trading, Tesla stock was down about 2% so far this year, and up about 72% over the past 12 months.

NEW YORK, Sept. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE:NVO) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo securities between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 30, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day.

Title: S&P 500 Set To Surge 30%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/15/sp-500-set-to-surge-30/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T10:00:48Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. In what's shaping up to be a pivotal week for global markets, the U.S. Federal Reserve is set to meet on September 16-17. Most analysts expect the Fed to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. While that’s the prevailing expectation, the Fed has a history of surprising markets. If they cut rates by 50 basis points instead of 25, it would be an unexpected move. Looking at past events, such surprises can serve as powerful catalysts for major market rallies. Our analysis shows that a move like this could potentially boost the market by 30%. That said, for investors looking for growth potential with lower exposure to the volatility of individual equities, consider the High Quality Portfolio. Since its inception, this portfolio has built a strong track record, consistently outperforming its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with cumulative returns exceeding 91%. Separately, see – XRP Price To Hit $10 In October? Recent history shows how impactful unexpected Fed moves can be. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, the Fed made two emergency rate cuts in March 2020 totaling 150 basis points. The first was a 50 basis point cut on March 3rd, followed by an even larger 100 basis point cut on March 15th that brought rates to near-zero. While markets initially dropped to around 2,237 on March 23, 2020, the aggressive action helped stabilize confidence. This sparked a massive rally, with the S&P 500 climbing to around 4,797 by January 2022—a gain of about 115% in under two years. Similarly, the 2019 rate cut cycle demonstrated the power of surprise. Beginning in July 2019, the Fed made three 25 basis point cuts, some of which were partly unexpected. These came after a period of rate hikes and helped fuel a major rally. From its low of about 2,346 in December 2018, the S&P 500 surged to around 3,393 by February 2020, a 45% gain in just 14 months. These examples show a clear pattern: when the Fed acts more aggressively than expected, it can ignite strong, sustained rallies. The current market setup is unique. The S&P 500 is trading near all-time highs around 6,584, unlike past rate-cut cycles, which often came during economic crises. The market has already priced in a 25 basis point cut, so a bigger move would be a major surprise. Adding complexity is political pressure from the Trump administration for deeper rate cuts. This could influence the Fed’s decision and the market’s response. Based on historical trends, the size of a surprise cut correlates directly with the rally potential. For perspective, the 45% rally starting in 2019 followed a total of 75 basis points in cuts, while the 115% rally from 2020 came after 150 basis points in emergency cuts. So a 50 basis point cut likely wouldn’t drive a rally on that scale, but a 30% gain is a realistic possibility. History shows that surprises can be powerful catalysts. There are compelling reasons for the Fed to go for an aggressive 50 basis point cut. The biggest is the element of surprise—since markets don’t expect it, such a move would be a strong signal. Lower rates also add liquidity, fueling growth and supporting multiple expansion as investors pay more for earnings. There’s also political pressure from the Trump administration, which could hint at more cuts to come. Of course, the Fed might do something else unexpected, like holding rates steady and maintaining its hawkish stance. That would likely hit markets hard. A lack of action could send the S&P 500 index down by as much as 8%. Inflation fears are real. See – Will Inflation Data Crush The S&P 500? – for more details. Even with the potential for a rally, there are key risks to consider. The upcoming Fed meeting is high stakes, and any deviation from the expected 25 basis point cut could spark big market moves. The consistent market swings after Fed meetings since 2019 highlight the importance of risk management. For instance, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio has outperformed the S&P 500 while avoiding much of this Fed-induced volatility, delivering cumulative returns of over 91% since inception—far better than broad market indices. A surprise 50-basis-point or larger Fed rate cut could still trigger a significant rally for the S&P 500, potentially 30% in the medium term based on historical precedent. However, the 2019 cycle offers a better comparison than the crisis-driven 2020 response, suggesting any rally would be more moderate but still substantial.

The firm offers high-speed connectivity solutions for Ethernet and AI infrastructure, including integrated circuits, active electrical cables, and IP licensing. This recent stock surge follows a spectacular first-quarter report, which ended on August 2, 2025, showing revenues soaring 274% year-over-year to $223.1 million. Credo also introduced its Bluebird Digital Signal Processor, a low-power, high-efficiency solution designed to reduce latency and power consumption in GPU communications – a known bottleneck for scaling next-generation AI workloads. The company also highlighted significant business achievements with hyperscalers, who play a crucial role in the AI rollout. So, is Credo stock still a worthwhile investment after the substantial rally, or is it too late? The AI narrative is pivotal to Credo’s expansion. The Bluebird DSP directly addresses power and efficiency issues in optical transceivers, essential for data centers powering generative AI. In Q1 FY’26, three hyperscalers each accounted for over 10% of revenue, with a fourth beginning to increase its collaboration with the company. Management anticipates these four will remain primary contributors through fiscal 2026, while two additional hyperscalers are expected to join. This provides high visibility into future growth, with the company forecasting approximately 120% revenue growth in FY26, significantly surpassing earlier estimates of 85%. For context, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) reported they could collectively invest $364 billion in capital expenditures for their respective fiscal years. If realized, this would establish Credo as a preferred supplier of AI infrastructure components during a time when cloud and chip industry leaders are rushing to expand their GPU clusters. This positions Credo as more than merely a chip supplier; it is emerging as a crucial enabler of hyperscaler AI developments. Naturally, investors must consider valuation. Credo is trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 47.3x and a price-to-earnings multiple of 227x – substantial premiums compared to the S&P 500’s 3.3x and 24.2x, respectively. Yet, these elevated multiples indicate more than just hype. Revenues have increased by 176% in the past year to $600 million, with quarterly growth surpassing the S&P 500 by over 40 times. Profitability is also strong, with a 20.8% net margin compared to 12.6% for the broader index, and the balance sheet remains robust, with only $16 million in debt against $480 million in cash. Therefore, overall, Credo is not a speculative cash-burning AI venture, but a profitable, cash-generating growth enterprise with minimal leverage. So, is it too late to invest? That ultimately depends on your risk tolerance. For investors focused on value, Credo certainly appears costly, and its history of dramatic fluctuations – including a 62% drop during the inflation crisis of 2022 – underscores the risks involved. However, for growth-oriented investors, the narrative is significantly more enticing. Credo is addressing one of the largest bottlenecks in AI data centers — power and latency — while strengthening its partnerships with hyperscalers who are central to the AI expansion. If adoption continues at the current rate, the current high multiples may well be justified by the company’s exceptional growth potential. In this regard, Credo stands out as a high-risk but potentially high-reward investment in the infrastructure sector of the AI revolution. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a collection of 30 stocks, has a proven record of significantly outperforming its benchmark, which includes the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indices. What accounts for this? As a collection, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk in comparison to the benchmark index, experiencing less volatility, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Boutique Investment Bank BDA Cuts Jobs in China on M&A Woes
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/boutique-investment-bank-bda-cuts-jobs-in-china-on-m-a-woes-11757909201245.html
Time Published: 2025-09-15T04:06:40Z
Full Content:
BDA Partners has cut some investment bankers in Shanghai to cope with intensifying competition in China and uncertainty over deals, people familiar with the matter said, marking the latest financial services firm to retreat from the world’s second-biggest economy. Five Shanghai-based investment bankers have been let go by the boutique firm, which focuses on mergers and acquisitions, and a couple have relocated to BDA’s Hong Kong office, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Three senior bankers are staying in Shanghai to work on existing mandates and originating new deals, the people said. BDA may also consider moving to a smaller office to cut costs, although no final decisions have been made, the people said. Founded in 1996 with offices in New York and Singapore, BDA provides Asia-focused M&A advice to global clients, mostly on small-to-mid-sized transactions, its website shows. It also has offices in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Seoul, Mumbai and Ho Chi Minh City, as well as London. “BDA has been in China since 1999 and we remain strongly committed to M&A across China, Hong Kong and Taiwan,” Simon Kavanagh, BDA’s head of Greater China, wrote in an emailed response to a query from Bloomberg News. “We continue active coverage of China, including having senior bankers on the ground in Hong Kong and the PRC.” While the volume of deals involving Chinese firms has grown this year, there are still plenty of challenges for advisers. They include a tightening of inbound investment, wide valuation gaps between buyers and sellers, cutthroat competition that is squeezing fees, and difficulty in getting deals finished because of geopolitical and regulatory tensions, such as with tariffs. Other investment banks, law firms and investment managers have also downsized in China. Prominent Wall Street law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP shuttered its Shanghai office last year and laid off staff. Fidelity International also planned to cut jobs in China, while Vanguard Group Inc., Van Eck Associates Corp. and Matthews International Capital Management LLC retreated too. Meanwhile, private equity firm Permira is overhauling its Asia strategy, closing offices in Hong Kong and Shanghai and shuffling senior leadership to India, where it sees stronger momentum and a more robust pipeline for deals, people familiar with the matter said earlier this year. Other alternative asset managers from KKR & Co. to Blackstone Inc. are also ramping up investments in India and elevating locally based executives to key regional roles. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: ROSEN, NATIONAL INVESTOR RIGHTS COUNSEL, Encourages Novo Nordisk A/S Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action - NVO

Full Content:
September 14, 2025 14:45 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

India's CSR regime, a significant source of social funding, has primarily focused on education, health, and rural development. However, it overlooks policy research, crucial for achieving true self-reliance. Increased CSR investment in think tanks and R&D could boost innovation, competitiveness, and effective governance, strengthening India's intellectual sovereignty and supporting national priorities.

Title: TSM-Bee? TSMC gets into the honey business after working with local beekeepers to establish hives around its fabs

TSMC branded honey is available in several flavors, depending on the flora around a particular fab. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. TSMC has worked with local beekeepers in Taiwan to produce ‘Ji Mi’ – TSMC branded honey. The production of this golden, viscous, and culinary important liquid has become possible around the world’s largest contract chipmaker fabs in Taiwan thanks to extensive environmental and sustainability efforts by the company. Sources: Liberty Times and Mirror Daily (machine translated). On Friday, TSMC presented at the ‘2025 Asia Pacific Sustainability Expo - Co-Prosperity x Growth Forum.’ At the event, its SVP of Corporate Sustainability, Ho Li-mei, claimed TSMC's commitment to ecological integration has reaped very worthwhile, and some surprising, dividends. The prime example, as per our headline, is that bees have returned to the local ecosystem around TSMC’s massive manufacturing facilities. Bees came naturally after the restoration of plant species chosen for their suitability, after environmental surveys. Now TSMC is collaborating with local beekeepers and Tunghai University to produce TSMC-exclusive honey – ‘Ji Mi.’ Other signs that nature’s balance has been restored around TSMC fabs are the return of native Taiwanese species like the silver goby in waters around the plants. It is also claimed that TSMC is the first semiconductor producer in Taiwan to have fireflies living on the site. Fireflies are notoriously fussy about the environments they inhabit in Taiwan. Tom’s Hardware regulars will be aware of TSMC’s previous concerns about water supplies. This resource pressure, and the need for TSMC to be particularly eco-friendly, given Taiwan’s rather small size, may have been instrumental to the surprising eco-dividends we are now seeing around its fabs. At the Expo, Ho Li-mei mentioned that TSMC has made major inroads in managing precious resources in the water-intensive semiconductor industry. Thanks to specialized resource management, water recycling at new facilities has been increased to over 90%, it is claimed. As resources are carefully conserved, semiconductor manufacturing waste is being reduced to the minimum. The source reports note that TSMC's waste recycling rate is as high as 97%, and less than 1% of waste in Taiwan is landfilled. Moreover, a modern ‘Zero Waste Center’ in Taichung has been successful at converting waste into electronic-grade raw materials – advancing the circular economy.

Defence stocks surged Rs 43,000 crore on Friday, lifting the Nifty Defence index to an eight-week high. Gains were driven by new submarine orders, a 15-year MoD modernisation roadmap, and strong order books. Analysts see long-term potential but caution that near-term upside may be limited by valuations and execution capacity.
