Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer says the robots aren’t coming for your paycheck — and she’s betting big that artificial intelligence will make more Americans upwardly mobile, not unemployed. In a Fox Business interview airing Labor Day weekend, the Oregon Republican-turned-cabinet-chief dismissed anxiety about mass layoffs as AI spreads from factory floors to office cubicles. “There should be no threat of AI displacing the American worker,” Chavez-DeRemer told Fox Business. “What we’re hearing on the ground is AI is here to stay,” she added. “The President wants the United States to be the leader in AI, to win that AI race.” The rosy portrait comes as corporate executives have warned that AI will likely reduce employment rolls in key white collar fields — with some doomsayers predicting a bloodbath of mass layoffs. Chavez-DeRemer, confirmed in March with bipartisan support, argued AI will take the drudgery out of tasks and help workers reach higher-pay roles supervising and operating the new tech. “I’ve been through companies where AI is assisting the American worker,” she said, describing a plant that replaced manual carbon-fiber coiling with 3-D printing. “Now those workers are reskilled and upskilled, and now they’re running the line.” The secretary’s rosy outlook comes as the administration rolls out an aggressive pro-AI agenda that seeks to assert US dominance in the technology, while keeping Main Street on board.

In April, President Trump signed an executive order making “AI literacy and proficiency” a national priority, directing agencies to seed K-12 classrooms, teacher training and apprenticeships with AI content and to expand pathways for lifelong learners. The White House followed in July with “America’s AI Action Plan,” which casts American workers as the policy’s center of gravity and tees up new measures to track AI’s labor-market impact, expand apprenticeships and stand up an “AI Workforce Research Hub” at the Labor Department. Last week, the Labor Department issued guidance urging states to use federal funding for AI-skills training — from prompting and evaluating AI outputs to basic cybersecurity tied to responsible use. The memo explicitly ties the push to the April executive order and spells out how youth, adult and dislocated-worker programs can weave AI into short-term classes, credentials and work-based learning. Leading tech and business figures have been sounding alarms that AI could wipe out up to half of all white-collar jobs within just a few years, with CEOs from Anthropic, Ford, Amazon and others openly bracing for mass cuts. Experts like Dario Amodei and Kai-Fu Lee warn of a looming “white-collar bloodbath,” with entry-level roles in finance, law, consulting and tech especially vulnerable. Former Google chief Eric Schmidt predicts most coding work will soon be done by AI, while Amazon’s Andy Jassy says corporate head-counts will shrink as efficiency improves. The IMF estimates 300 million jobs worldwide could be disrupted, urging governments to pour resources into retraining to cushion the blow. Even AI champions like Sam Altman admit that “jobs are definitely going to go away, full stop,” warning that the transition will be painful before any new opportunities emerge. One study suggests this could already be happening for entry-level workers, whose skills are the easiest to replicate with AI. Economists found that employment for young software engineers dropped 20% between late 2022 and early 2023, according to the Wall Street Journal. Advertisement

Title: Ethereum cofounder Joseph Lubin, ‘ETH will likely 100x from here’

Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin predicts massive institutional adoption as Wall Street and treasury companies ramp up ETH holdings. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin just gave ETH bulls something to chew on. In a post on X, he applauded Fundstrat’s Tom Lee on his vision for the future of finance and the expanding role of Ethereum in traditional institutions. “Yes, ETH will likely 100x from here. Probably much more.” As a blockchain pioneer, Joseph Lubin is best known as a co-founder of Ethereum and the founder and CEO of Consensys, the largest web3 software studio. Drawing on deep roots in finance as a former Goldman Sachs VP, Lubin has been instrumental in developing Ethereum as the preeminent platform for decentralized finance and smart contracts since 2014. Responding to Tom Lee’s bullish outlook, Lubin predicts a seismic shift in global finance: Wall Street giants will soon run validators, operate L2s and L3s, and write smart contracts to move their business infrastructure onto Ethereum rails. JPMorgan, for example, has used Ethereum-based technology for its permissioned blockchain projects for about a decade and is joined by Goldman Sachs, Onyx, and a growing roster of major banks launching stablecoin and DeFi initiatives on Ethereum. Since June 2025, treasury companies, including Bitmine Immersion and Sharplink Gaming, have added 2.6% of all ETH in circulation to their reserves. When combined with inflows to new ETH ETFs, institutional buyers account for nearly 5% of Ethereum’s supply so far this year. Sharplink and Bitmine now hold over $6 billion in ETH, setting industry benchmarks for corporate adoption. And with the approval of multiple Ethereum ETFs, asset managers like BlackRock and VanEck have invested billions into ETH for their clients, marking a tipping point in its adoption as a primary digital asset for institutional treasuries. VanEck’s CEO recently dubbed Ethereum “Wall Street’s token,” and Lubin argues that the transformative potential of Ethereum derives from “decentralized trust,” a quality Wall Street sorely needs. As legacy institutions migrate from fragmented, siloed infrastructure to unified decentralized rails, staking ETH becomes both a technical and economic imperative: “Nobody on the planet can currently fathom how large and fast a rigorously decentralized economy, saturated with hybrid human-machine intelligence, operating on decentralized Ethereum Trustware, can grow.” In his view, not only will L2s and L3s drive more usage of the Ethereum base layer, but “ETH will likely 100x from here” and eventually “flippen the Bitcoin/BTC monetary base.” Ethereum’s surging momentum doesn’t come without bumps in the road. September is historically Ethereum’s toughest month, averaging a -6.42% return since 2016. The combination of a meteoric summer rally (up 76% year-to-date, nearly 25% in August) and seasonal trends may see a pullback in the month ahead, especially as macro sentiment, monetary policy, and profit-taking could weigh on prices. Still, bullish fundamentals remain. Net ETH inflows from institutions, the steady climb in corporate treasury holdings, rising yields from staking (~3% APY), and ongoing upgrades all point to a stronger long-term outlook, as Lubin states: “The one quibble that I have with what Tom has been saying, and I keep telling him this: he is not nearly bullish enough.” Christina is a web3 writer, editor, and content manager with a passion for technology and starting important conversations.

Title: Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs face $291 mln in outflows: Is a market shift coming?

Could Ethereum be gearing up to outshine Bitcoin? Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs saw sharp outflows on the 29th of August, with ETH funds losing $164.6 million and BTC funds $126.6 million, amid renewed macroeconomic pressure. Ethereum’s [ETH] impressive streak of ETF inflows in August has come to a halt, closing the month on a note of heavy withdrawals. According to data from Farside Investors, ETH ETFs registered a sharp outflow of $164.6 million on the 29th of August. It effectively ended six consecutive days of strong inflows that had drawn nearly $1.9 billion into the market. Grayscale’s ETHE product led the retreat with $61.3 million in outflows, followed by $51 million from Fidelity’s ETH fund, $28.6 million from Grayscale’s other ETH offering, and $23.7 million from Bitwise. Other issuers, including BlackRock, saw no net flows on the day. The reversal coincided with Ethereum’s price action, trading at $4,442 after a 6.75% weekly decline, though it managed a slight 1% recovery in the past 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap. A similar trend played out on the Bitcoin [BTC] side, where ETFs recorded combined outflows of $126.6 million, the first day of losses since 22nd August. The largest outflow came from 21Shares’ ARKB, which lost $72.1 million, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $66.2 million withdrawn, while Grayscale’s GBTC recorded $15.3 million in exits. However, the pain wasn’t universal, as BlackRock’s IBIT attracted $24.63 million and WisdomTree’s BTCW added $2.3 million, though most other issuers reported flat activity. This aligned with Bitcoin slipping 5.32% over the week but was changing hands at $108,783.89 with a modest 0.6% rebound in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. The timing of these outflows further aligned with fresh macroeconomic data out of the U.S. In July, the Federal Reserve’s favored measure of inflation, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, increased by 2.9% compared to last year, marking its fastest rise since February. The hotter-than-expected print raised speculation about prolonged tight monetary policy, dampening appetite for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. However, despite the near-term jitters, optimism around Ethereum’s long-term prospects remains intact. Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin echoed the bullish thesis of Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, both projecting that ETH’s valuation could climb by as much as 100 times over the coming years. Lubin noted, “Yes, ETH will likely 100x from here. Probably much more. Yes, Ethereum/ETH will flippen the Bitcoin/BTC monetary base.” Lookonchain’s on-chain analytics highlighted that a long-term Bitcoin investor recently moved 2,000 BTC, valued at $217 million, into Hyperliquid to swap it for spot Ethereum. This shows a growing conviction among some seasoned players that Ethereum could outperform in the next cycle. In fact, as per AMBCrypto’s recent analysis, many market watchers believe that Q4 could ignite an Ethereum-led rally, with ambitious projections of a possible climb toward $10,000. If this becomes the case, then the recent outflows may be little more than a pause before Ethereum reclaims center stage in the crypto market.

Title: ETH And BTC ETFs Reverse Gains With $291M In Outflows Ahead Of New Week

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. US-based crypto ETFs have witnessed a change in dynamics in August, which has seen inflows tipping towards Ethereum ETFs. However, last week’s trend of strong inflows ended with substantial outflows on Friday, with Ethereum ETFs leading the retreat with $164.64 million and Bitcoin ETFs following with $126.64 million. This sudden reversal coincides with an interesting timing of stubborn inflation data that seems to have rattled institutional investors. According to data from Farside Investors, US-based Spot Ethereum ETFs ended the week with $164.64 million in outflows. The outflows came from Fidelity’s FETH with $51 million, Bitwise’s ETHW with $23.7 million, Grayscale’s ETHE with $28.6 million, and Grayscale’s ETH with $61.3 million. BlackRock, on the other hand, witnessed neither inflows nor outflows into its Spot ETH ETFs, alongside 21Shares, VanEck, Invesco, and Franklin Templeton Ethereum ETFs. Friday’s outflows were a jarring departure from the steady gain that had defined Ethereum’s Spot ETFs since August 21. Ethereum’s six-day inflow streak, which had added about $1.876 billion, was brought to an abrupt end with the outflows on Friday. As a result, total assets under management for Spot Ethereum ETFs dipped to $28.58 billion. Ethereum ETF Flow: Farside Investors Meanwhile, Spot Bitcoin ETFs also recorded their first daily decline since August 22 with $126.64 million in outflows on Friday. As a result, their total assets under management dropped to $139.95 billion. However, not every issuer felt the pressure with Bitcoin. Fidelity’s FBTC led the exodus with $66.2 million, followed by ARKB’s $72.07 million and GBTC’s $15.3 million in outflows. On the other hand, BlackRock’s IBIT still managed $24.63 million in inflows and WisdomTree’s BTCW drew in $2.3 million amid the wider outflows. Bitcoin ETF Flow: Farside Investors The underlying cause of the outflows can be attributed to investors digesting the latest data on inflation released on Friday. Notably, the US core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index climbed 2.9% year-over-year in July, the fastest pace since February, creating fears that the Federal Reserve may hold off on rate cuts. As a new trading week begins, Spot ETF flow in both Ethereum and Bitcoin is likely to depend on how investors continue to interpret the data. If inflation pressures persist, institutional investors may retreat further at the beginning of the week. However, any signs of cooling could see inflows resume mid-week, particularly into Ethereum, where fundamentals are currently favorable. On the price side of things, Bitcoin’s hold above the $108,000 price may offer some relief. However, it needs to stay above $110,000 in order for any upside move to gain momentum. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,910. For Ethereum, a daily close above $4,500 could confirm the return of bullish confidence, whereas a slide below $4,400 might signal further weakness. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,470, up by 1.7% in the past 24 hours.

Title: Google Investors Surprisingly Chill About Major Data Breach

Time Published: 2025-08-31T13:05:36Z

The stock of Google’s parent company ended Fridayâs trading session relatively unchanged, as investors digested news of a major data leak and broader market developments. Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)âs shares closed at $213.53, up slightly from the day’s prior end price, despite Google‘s global security alert advising its 2.5 billion Gmail users to update their information following a data breach involving one of its Salesforce databases. The company immediately issued a network-wide alert telling users to change their password immediately. Despite all that, investors in Google had either not fully digested the news during Friday trade, or were watching see what fallout might continue over the weekend, before pricing in any hit to the company’s value. Though consumerÂ GmailÂ and Cloud accounts were not directly compromised, the incident has triggered an aggressive wave of phishing and impersonation attacks targeting users across the platform. The leak, which exposed hundreds of thousands of sensitive documents and personal data, has underscored growing concerns about cybersecurity risks facing major tech firms. Still, despite major data breaches at all the tech giants, seemingly in an endless game of round robin, investors continue to believe the potential of these companies outweighs most security concerns. Alphabet said in a statement it is investigating the breach and implementing additional security measures, but the incident has added to scrutiny of data management practices across the industry. âThe safety and privacy of user data are paramount,â it read. âWe are working diligently to address these issues and prevent future incidents.â Meanwhile, investors are still nervously cautious about signs of economic slowdown and Federal Reserve signals hinting at future interest rate cuts. Despite the turbulence, Alphabetâs stock maintained its position, reflecting investorsâ ongoing confidence in the companyâs core advertising and cloud businesses. But questions about data security continue to cloud its outlook. As the debate over digital privacy and cybersecurity intensifies, Alphabetâs response and its ability to restore trust will be closely watched by shareholders and regulators alike. Google sought this week to reassure consumers and investors. The breach exposed thousands of sensitive records, including personal details, corporate documents, and government information. The leaked data spread across multiple sources and was easily accessible via search engines. It includes confidential information such as legal files, financial records, and private communications. Experts warn that such exposure not only jeopardizes individual privacy but also heightens the risk of corporate espionage, identity theft, and national security threats. In its statement, Google emphasized that it is actively investigating the incident and has deployed additional security measures to identify and mitigate the breachâs impact. Cybersecurity analysts warn that the proliferation of data leaks reflects broader systemic issues in how companies handle sensitive information, as the industry remains largely unregulated and prone to cyberattacks. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for stronger data protection standards and increased transparency around data management practices. As consumers and businesses grapple with the potential fallout, authorities worldwide are calling for stricter oversight of data security protocols to mitigate the risks posed by such breaches in an increasingly interconnected world.

Title: KPop Demon Hunters’ HUNTR/X: The Significance Of A VMA Nomination

ByBraedon Montgomery, Contributor. Since its release on August 23, 2025, Netflix’s KPop Demon Hunters has taken the world by storm. With the film consistently ranking in Netflix’s top 10, breaking the streaming service’s record for most-watched film with over 236 million viewers, and the song “Golden” reaching the coveted #1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 , a feat that a female girl group hasn’t achieved since Destiny’s Child released their hit "Independent Woman, Part 1" in 2000, it’s clear that the stars of the animated film, HUNTR/X, pronounced “Huntrix,” are making waves in the industry. Even one of these achievements would solidify an artist's standing, but this girl group has several, and here’s the thing: they aren’t finished yet. With their singing voices provided by EJAE, Audrey Nuna, and Rei Ami, the group was created to go beyond the world of animation. With animation by Sony Pictures Imageworks, dynamic choreography combined with powerful vocals makes Rumi, Mira, and Zoey feel like real K-Pop idols, even though the audience knows they are animated. Their performances, style, and voices, combined with Netflix’s overwhelming streaming power explain why this group quickly achieved chart-topping hits, streams, and nominations since the films' release. The MTV Video Music Awards have been a way to measure the staying power and impact of musical acts and stars in moments that have stayed at the forefront of pop culture history. From Lady Gaga’s meat dress to Beyoncé revealing her pregnancy after performing or Janet Jackson’s tribute to her late brother, Michael Jackson, the VMAs are a night for juggernauts in the music industry to showcase their talent and earn awards for their contributions to the industry. While it might seem unusual that a fictional group could be nominated, let alone win at the VMAs, other groups, especially virtual bands, have performed at and even won awards at the show in the past. The Gorillaz, for instance, are a virtual band and the brainchild of Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett, and back in 2005, they had Noodle, a cartoon and one of the band members, deliver an acceptance speech in a short animation where she called in from a capsule hotel room on behalf of her group members. That same year, the group performed live using hologram technology at the MTV EMAs, where they played their hit song Feel Good Inc. with De La Soul. What started as a passion project turned into proof that virtual acts can attract audiences on real-life stages. While MTV has already confirmed performances, acts like Lady Gaga, Post Malone, Ricky Martin, who will receive the Latin Icon Award, and Mariah Carey, who will receive the Video Vanguard Award, how well HUNTR/X is received could be an indicator for whether or not there is a space for them to perform in the future, as Netflix has already expressed interest in continuing projects set in the world of KPop Demon Hunters. At the VMAs, if past group performances are any guide, anything can happen. Whether HUNTR/X wins or they put on a virtual show with animation, holograms, or a montage of film clips, the nomination itself is a spectacle and something to be proud of. This could be a defining moment in pop culture history, one where Netflix allows its fictional girl group to crossover into the real world. HUNTR/X has already demonstrated its ability to succeed with streaming and merchandise; now, the MTV VMAs might be the launchpad that this world-dominating animated girl group needs to step into the real world and conquer another frontier while its popularity is still at its peak: touring.

The majority of the early adopters wasted their money chasing the promised la-la world. It took a lot of painful efforts in strategising, governance and change management that finally turned these technologies to deliver the benefits. It looks like Gen-AI projects are in the same situation today. Enterprise boards were quick to embrace it for its transformative power, but the latest findings from MIT’s NANDA initiative reveal a sobering truth: Of the hundreds of deployments surveyed, a mere 5% achieved rapid revenue acceleration, while the rest linger in pilot purgatory or total failure. The “GenAI Divide” is real and widening. Why this disheartening pattern? And, more importantly, how can enterprises reverse this? To the experienced eye, the culprits seem obvious: yet-to-mature technology, unclear regulation, or the occasional model hallucination. But the MIT findings suggest the real villain is the flawed integration and huge learning gap. As a general-purpose tool, Gen-AI is great for individual users. For most knowledge workers, platforms like ChatGPT turn productive in content creation, faster search and analysis. But this becomes sort of a liability at scale. They seem to fail to adapt to enterprise workflow and not get attached to proprietary data ecosystems. They miss the finer contextual details to make complex decisions. Therein lies the failure of pilots. * More than half of AI budgets was allocated to sales and marketing tools, and key areas where substantial ROI could be lying were ignored, especially in back-office automation. Imagine how much enterprises would have saved if BPO costs were eliminated or if the reliance on external agencies were eliminated. Even operational excellence could drive better ROI by reducing costs. * Building one’s own solutions succeeds only one-third as often as purchased solutions. Most businesses refuse to believe this and stubbornly pursue in-house development. Partnering with specialised providers makes better sense. * Centralised adoption with innovation teams to drive AI, creates ivory towers. Success correlates strongly with empowering line managers and embedding AI into day-to-day operational decisions. * Employees, starved of sanctioned tools, adopt unsupported solutions like ChatGPT. This leads to compliance and security risks, with governance gaps. Clearly, the evidence is there for enterprises to follow a different playbook and avoid such blunders. (i) Can you anchor AI to one high-stake pain point? Air Canada didn’t deploy Gen-AI for broad marketing tactics but for automating contract review and compliance checks. It found a 60% reduction in legal processing times and delivered measurable cost savings. The few success stories show a common theme: unwavering focus. In contrast, companies that scatter AI budgets across multiple areas without prioritising have seen poor or no impact, leading to scepticism. (ii) Can you first buy or partner and then build? During the COVID-19 vaccine race, Pfizer engaged startups like Concerto HealthAI as partners to use AI in accelerating drug discovery. This buy-and-partner strategy helped in reducing years from research timelines in vaccine discovery using the power of ecosystems. Proprietary AI systems may sound exciting, but when you need a lot of data, going all alone is the loud noise before defeat. Many financial services companies have built proprietary GenAI engines in isolation and ended up halting rollouts and increasing costs, typically associated with the build-it-yourself fallacy. (iii) Can you decentralise rollout to the edges? Unilever has trained SBU heads along with data scientists to identify AI use cases, which resulted in a successful rollout. This way, GenAI was embedded into forecasting and procurement, saving millions in supply chain improvements. AI should not be a cloistered experiment in a central lab. Real transformation occurs when line managers own the integration. A large MNC bank poured resources into its “AI Centre of Excellence” but barred branch managers from influencing pilots, leading to wonderful PoCs that never scaled. (iv) Can you reorganise workflows before AI integration? The shipping liner, Maersk, started with standardising shipping documentation and digitised customs workflows before integrating GenAI for intelligent document processing. This resulted in a 30% reduction in turnaround time at ports. Do not treat AI as a plug-in for processes that are broken. Many e-retailers tend to layer chatbots over chaotic customer service workflows, and this will frustrate both agents and consumers. (v) Can you manage the human angle with foresight? IBM used an attrition-led reskilling model and announced that AI would automate over 7500 roles. It simultaneously invested in upskilling plans for data analytics and AI ethics. By doing both, it contained employee anxieties and kept its brand image of a responsible innovator. In an era when human roles are made redundant, managing panic-driven layoffs is critical and not like the TCS layoffs recently. Mass lay-offs by Meta and Amazon eroded trust and drove talent to competitors, damaging the employer brand. (vi) Can you incorporate governance and metrics? What Microsoft has done with its Copilot for enterprise clients is a case in point. It includes a robust ROI framework, tracking metrics like time-to-task completion and employee satisfaction. This helps in driving AI as a credible performer. Remember the saying, “What cannot be measured cannot be scaled.” Businesses that skirt this issue fake wins, with CFOs questioning the effectiveness of every rupee spent. Tech won’t save you; culture will. The winners? They treat failure like a cheap intern: tolerated, taught, then fired fast. They hype small wins like blockbuster premieres. And Gen-AI? It’s Fool’s Gold – shiny, seductive, yet treacherous. Be reminded: AI won’t replace you, but dumb strategy surely will.

Title: NVIDIA & Magnificent 7: Too Hot To Handle?

ByBill Stone, Contributor. As the dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, NVIDIA (NVDA) has become the largest company in the world and within the S&P 500 index. Following NVIDIA’s earnings last week, it’s an appropriate time to revisit the attractiveness of large technology stocks with a special emphasis on NVIDIA. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), collectively account for nearly 34% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization. Eight of the ten largest companies in the S&P 500 are technology companies, including Broadcom (AVGO). Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are the only non-technology companies in the top ten. Investors already appreciate the strong fundamentals of the Magnificent 7, and NVIDIA in particular, with stock returns far outstripping those of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA have achieved total returns of 280% and 1,093%, respectively, since the start of the ChatGPT era at the end of 2022, while the S&P 500 has returned 75%. Based on the past twelve months of earnings and consensus earnings estimates for the next twelve months, the price-to-earnings ratios for all the Magnificent 7 stocks are above the S&P 500. While this ratio indicates that most of these companies have a higher valuation on both measures, it doesn’t answer whether other factors justify that premium. Another way to value companies is by their multiple revenues, which is called the price-to-sales ratio. All the Magnificent 7 are valued at price-to-sales ratios above the S&P 500, with NVIDIA at an almost twenty-seven times price-to-sales ratio. Historical annualized growth in sales over the last three and five years has been impressive for most of the group, but downright amazing for NVIDIA. Likewise, historical earnings per share growth has generally been impressive and exceptional, as seen in cases like NVIDIA. The five-year annualized earnings per share growth rate of the Magnificent 7 demonstrates just how unique these companies have been when compared to the stock market as a whole. Future earnings are the most crucial criterion when considering whether to buy or hold a stock. Consensus forecasts from Wall Street analysts still evidence significant optimism about NVIDIA’s earnings growth prospects, with 39% annualized growth expected from the world’s largest company. Separately, the sustainable growth rate for the group supports the future growth story. The sustainable growth rate theoretically indicates how fast a company can grow without borrowing additional funds while maintaining its existing capital structure. The profitability metrics of most of the Magnificent 7 are impressive. Gross margins represent the profitability after all direct expenses, specifically the cost of goods sold, have been deducted from sales. Operating margins measure how much a company earns on a dollar of sales after paying for the variable expenses, or the percentage of sales converted into operating income. NVIDIA converted almost seventy cents of every sales dollar into operating profit over the last year. While NVIDIA’s gross margin was about 70% over the previous year, it improved to 75% in the most recent quarter. Just looking at a simple high price-to-earnings ratio can be deceiving when analyzing a company with high returns on invested capital (ROIC). It is crucial to consider the return generated on the capital needed to fund a business, since a company with a sustainably higher ROIC should sell at a valuation premium. To put some of the impressive return on invested capital figures for the Magnificent 7 into proper perspective, the ROIC for the S&P 500 is around 8%. Furthermore, most companies in the Magnificent 7 generate substantial amounts of free cash flow, despite investing in growing businesses. The free cash flow margin indicates the percentage of revenue that the company can utilize or distribute to shareholders as free cash flow. NVIDIA is exceptional, with almost forty-four cents of every dollar in sales converted to free cash flow. The free cash flow yield refers to the free cash flow per share generated by a business, expressed as a percentage of its stock price. Value investors, such as Warren Buffett, value a company based on the cash that can be distributed from a business over its lifetime, discounted back to the present. Free cash flow can be a good measure of the money available to owners. A free cash flow yield below that of the S&P 500, such as the Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA, can be seen as investors already pricing in superior growth and durability of free cash flow relative to the market. NVIDIA is particularly notable given the massive increase in its market capitalization, which now exceeds $4.2 trillion, driven by the artificial intelligence spending wave. The consumer introduction of ChatGPT as an artificial intelligence tool in late 2022 coincided with a sharp rise in NVIDIA’s valuation, as the company became the dominant supplier of AI semiconductors. There has been some concern about NVIDIA’s relatively meager beat of consensus earnings estimates last week and less exceptional guidance than has been typical. There were zero sales to China in the quarter due to geopolitical tensions, which made for more challenging comparisons. For example, data center sales, which were impacted by China, declined by 1% quarter-over-quarter, but were up about 12% quarter-over-quarter excluding China, according to TD Cowen. Despite NVIDIA’s less optimistic forward guidance than was hoped, a resumption in sales to China could add $2 to $5 billion in sales. In the short term, NVIDIA’s dominance in high-end artificial intelligence computing appears untouchable, as its next-generation platform is on pace for meaningful production next year. Furthermore, the company continues to benefit from AI demand outstripping supply, alleviating concerns about potential pricing pressures. It appears likely that AI will be a transformative tool for businesses and households, generating substantial economic benefits. Although it is still early, indications suggest that artificial intelligence adoption is continuing at a brisk pace. The capital spending (capex) by AI-leaders, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, to support complex computations needed to support AI, has seen a massive rise since 2023. NVIDIA reaped significant revenue from this spending as the leading chip provider for AI. Estimates are that capital spending by these four AI leaders will exceed $400 billion by 2026. What if demand for AI services doesn’t meet expectations or the firms are unable to monetize the services at a profitable enough level? Capital expenditures (capex) budgets can indeed be slashed if needed. This downside risk isn’t a forecast, but it must be considered when evaluating NVIDIA and all AI-connected technology stocks. Notably, these sizable capital expenditures are more sustainable than some past instances, because the companies are highly profitable and can self-fund rather than depending on the charity of lenders or additional capital. Though it is nowhere in sight, one must always be wary of some competing technology eventually displacing NVIDIA as a dominant leader. Capitalism subjects companies to intense competition in their pursuit of profits, and the profits generated by technology leaders make them an attractive target. The bullish case for large tech and NVIDIA is bolstered by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). The mega-cap technology stocks, represented by the Magnificent 7, continue to produce earnings and free cash flow at impressive rates. Large technology stocks typically exhibit exceptional profitability compared to the average stock and should therefore trade at a premium valuation. The rise in the stock prices of the Magnificent 7, including NVIDIA, has been supported by robust fundamentals and not just a promise of future profitability. Investors buy or hold companies for their future profits, not their past performance. The past is only significant to the extent that it informs the firm’s future prospects. While one needs to remain mindful of risk, the robust adoption rate of artificial intelligence, combined with companies’ ability to self-fund the massive costs required to build AI infrastructure, implies that the end is not yet here. Investors should be mindful of the risk associated with concentrated holdings, given the remarkable growth of some of these technology leaders.

Separately, the sustainable growth rate for the group supports the future growth story. The sustainable growth rate theoretically indicates how fast a company can grow without borrowing additional funds while maintaining its existing capital structure. The profitability metrics of most of the Magnificent 7 are impressive. Gross margins represent the profitability after all direct expenses, specifically the cost of goods sold, have been deducted from sales. Operating margins measure how much a company earns on a dollar of sales after paying for the variable expenses, or the percentage of sales converted into operating income. NVIDIA converted almost seventy cents of every sales dollar into operating profit over the last year. While NVIDIA’s gross margin was about 70% over the previous year, it improved to 75% in the most recent quarter. Just looking at a simple high price-to-earnings ratio can be deceiving when analyzing a company with high returns on invested capital (ROIC). It is crucial to consider the return generated on the capital needed to fund a business, since a company with a sustainably higher ROIC should sell at a valuation premium. To put some of the impressive return on invested capital figures for the Magnificent 7 into proper perspective, the ROIC for the S&P 500 is around 8%. Furthermore, most companies in the Magnificent 7 generate substantial amounts of free cash flow, despite investing in growing businesses. The free cash flow margin indicates the percentage of revenue that the company can utilize or distribute to shareholders as free cash flow. NVIDIA is exceptional, with almost forty-four cents of every dollar in sales converted to free cash flow. The free cash flow yield refers to the free cash flow per share generated by a business, expressed as a percentage of its stock price. Value investors, such as Warren Buffett, value a company based on the cash that can be distributed from a business over its lifetime, discounted back to the present. Free cash flow can be a good measure of the money available to owners. A free cash flow yield below that of the S&P 500, such as the Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA, can be seen as investors already pricing in superior growth and durability of free cash flow relative to the market. NVIDIA is particularly notable given the massive increase in its market capitalization, which now exceeds $4.2 trillion, driven by the artificial intelligence spending wave. The consumer introduction of ChatGPT as an artificial intelligence tool in late 2022 coincided with a sharp rise in NVIDIA’s valuation, as the company became the dominant supplier of AI semiconductors. There has been some concern about NVIDIA’s relatively meager beat of consensus earnings estimates last week and less exceptional guidance than has been typical. There were zero sales to China in the quarter due to geopolitical tensions, which made for more challenging comparisons. For example, data center sales, which were impacted by China, declined by 1% quarter-over-quarter, but were up about 12% quarter-over-quarter excluding China, according to TD Cowen. Despite NVIDIA’s less optimistic forward guidance than was hoped, a resumption in sales to China could add $2 to $5 billion in sales. In the short term, NVIDIA’s dominance in high-end artificial intelligence computing appears untouchable, as its next-generation platform is on pace for meaningful production next year. Furthermore, the company continues to benefit from AI demand outstripping supply, alleviating concerns about potential pricing pressures. It appears likely that AI will be a transformative tool for businesses and households, generating substantial economic benefits. Although it is still early, indications suggest that artificial intelligence adoption is continuing at a brisk pace. The capital spending (capex) by AI-leaders, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, to support complex computations needed to support AI, has seen a massive rise since 2023. NVIDIA reaped significant revenue from this spending as the leading chip provider for AI. Estimates are that capital spending by these four AI leaders will exceed $400 billion by 2026. What if demand for AI services doesn’t meet expectations or the firms are unable to monetize the services at a profitable enough level? Capital expenditures (capex) budgets can indeed be slashed if needed. This downside risk isn’t a forecast, but it must be considered when evaluating NVIDIA and all AI-connected technology stocks. Notably, these sizable capital expenditures are more sustainable than some past instances, because the companies are highly profitable and can self-fund rather than depending on the charity of lenders or additional capital. Though it is nowhere in sight, one must always be wary of some competing technology eventually displacing NVIDIA as a dominant leader. Capitalism subjects companies to intense competition in their pursuit of profits, and the profits generated by technology leaders make them an attractive target. The bullish case for large tech and NVIDIA is bolstered by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). The mega-cap technology stocks, represented by the Magnificent 7, continue to produce earnings and free cash flow at impressive rates. Large technology stocks typically exhibit exceptional profitability compared to the average stock and should therefore trade at a premium valuation. The rise in the stock prices of the Magnificent 7, including NVIDIA, has been supported by robust fundamentals and not just a promise of future profitability. Investors buy or hold companies for their future profits, not their past performance. The past is only significant to the extent that it informs the firm’s future prospects. While one needs to remain mindful of risk, the robust adoption rate of artificial intelligence, combined with companies’ ability to self-fund the massive costs required to build AI infrastructure, implies that the end is not yet here. Investors should be mindful of the risk associated with concentrated holdings, given the remarkable growth of some of these technology leaders.

ByBill Stone, Contributor. As the dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, NVIDIA (NVDA) has become the largest company in the world and within the S&P 500 index. Following NVIDIA’s earnings last week, it’s an appropriate time to revisit the attractiveness of large technology stocks with a special emphasis on NVIDIA. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), collectively account for nearly 34% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization. Eight of the ten largest companies in the S&P 500 are technology companies, including Broadcom (AVGO). Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are the only non-technology companies in the top ten. Investors already appreciate the strong fundamentals of the Magnificent 7, and NVIDIA in particular, with stock returns far outstripping those of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA have achieved total returns of 280% and 1,093%, respectively, since the start of the ChatGPT era at the end of 2022, while the S&P 500 has returned 75%. Based on the past twelve months of earnings and consensus earnings estimates for the next twelve months, the price-to-earnings ratios for all the Magnificent 7 stocks are above the S&P 500. While this ratio indicates that most of these companies have a higher valuation on both measures, it doesn’t answer whether other factors justify that premium. Another way to value companies is by their multiple revenues, which is called the price-to-sales ratio. All the Magnificent 7 are valued at price-to-sales ratios above the S&P 500, with NVIDIA at an almost twenty-seven times price-to-sales ratio. Historical annualized growth in sales over the last three and five years has been impressive for most of the group, but downright amazing for NVIDIA. Likewise, historical earnings per share growth has generally been impressive and exceptional, as seen in cases like NVIDIA. The five-year annualized earnings per share growth rate of the Magnificent 7 demonstrates just how unique these companies have been when compared to the stock market as a whole. Future earnings are the most crucial criterion when considering whether to buy or hold a stock.

Title: I missed out on my first choice in Trinity. Will CAO points drop in round two?

I missed out on my first-choice course – business, economics and social studies in Trinity – by 23 points in last Wednesday’s round of CAO offers. I have been offered another business degree programme in Dublin, but really want to study Bess in Trinity. What are the chances points will drop in later rounds? The chances of a high-demand course such as Bess at Trinity dropping in points by this margin is remote, based on trends over previous years. This means you have until 3pm on Tuesday, September 2nd, to accept the lower preference offer you received last Wednesday. After that, the offer lapses. If you are appealing grades in this year’s Leaving Cert, remember, there is usually a one-in-four or one-in-five chance of getting an upgrade, based on previous trends. If your mind is really set on securing a place in Bess at Trinity and you don’t accept your lower preference offer today, you have a number of options: 1. Repeat the Leaving Cert, hoping to secure higher scores next year. This route, once popular, has diminished in numbers in recent years. 2. Apply for a place in one of the business or law programmes offered by further education colleges in the next few days. You can access a list of all such level-five PLC (post-Leaving Cert) programmes online (Qualifax.ie). These programmes are usually assessed through a series of eight modules or assignments which students submit monthly from October-May. Further education (FE) or PLC courses as a route into university are probably one of the best-kept secrets of the education system. Many students – and parents – still don’t know enough about them, even though they offer an excellent route to third level, outside the pressure cooker CAO points system. In fact, there are more than 1,000 CAO courses across all areas which admit PLC students. In your case, I am aware of FE students who, having completed their level-five business or law programme, secured an offer of a place in Bess at Trinity. But in every case that I am aware of, the applicant secured distinctions across all eight modules in their course. This is a very useful pathway for students who need a year to prepare themselves for the challenges of university life. In PLC courses, students tend to have the time and space to develop more independent learning skills, learn to work in teams and deliver projects on time and to a high standard. So, if your heart really is set on Bess, why not seek a place on a locally based business PLC programme immediately. Blackrock Further Education College, for example, offers separate level-five programmes in both business and law. In the unlikely event you receive enough upgrades in the Leaving Cert, or the points requirements drop significantly in the coming weeks, you will receive a late offer from the CAO, which you could then accept.

Title: Breda O’Brien: Interest in Jim Gavin says little for Micheál Martin’s faith in his party colleagues

Since 2011 Micheál Martin has shaped Fianna Fáil more than any other individual. While most acknowledge his relentless work ethic while rebuilding a party in danger of collapse, not every supporter is happy with where he has steered Fianna Fáil. He has done much to improve Fianna Fáil’s perceived image of being cute hoors who were fond of the odd brown envelope. However, he has also alienated many grassroots supporters. They were particularly baffled by his disastrously out-of-touch support for the 2024 Family and Care referendums. His approach to the presidential election has also exposed his distance from his parliamentary party. He seemed disinclined to have Fianna Fáil contest the election at all. However, the symbolic nature of the office remains important, even if securing it has recently resembled the Hunger Games more than an electoral process. A presidential election allows individuals and parties to interrogate their values and present them to the public. Perhaps Fianna Fáil no longer really knows what it stands for. It is not as if there was any scarcity of shy but willing candidates, including Martin’s former close ally, Billy Kelleher. Bertie Ahern, Mary Hanafin and Éamon Ó Cuív, although very different characters, seemed to inspire the same terror as the Ghost of Christmas Past, causing Martin to cry out like Ebenezer Scrooge, “Leave me! ... Haunt me no longer!” Martin’s reasons for opposing Ahern’s run have been well-rehearsed. He has no desire to remind the electorate of being central to Ahern’s team as the economy went into catastrophic meltdown. Hanafin probably lost her chance of a nomination in 2014. She defied instructions to withdraw her candidacy in the local elections in the so-called Battle of Blackrock. Despite winning with relative ease, Hanafin stood in the way of Martin’s preferred type of candidate, a young woman with impeccable liberal credentials, Kate Feeney. (She also got elected.) Éamon Ó Cuív is a distinct case. He epitomises the stark change in the values of Fianna Fáil since 2011. Although reared in Dublin, his focus has been on community capacity-building, particularly in rural areas, ever since he became the manager of a Gaeltacht development co-operative in Corr na Móna. He has always fought for a State responsive to its people, rather than an impenetrable bureaucracy. He has remained a constitutional nationalist and passionate advocate for the Irish language. He is the antithesis of a finger up to the wind politician and has clashed with Martin on everything from going into Coalition to the Fiscal Compact treaty. For some, he is the great lost leader who could have upheld the better instincts of Fianna Fáil, the localist – as opposed to clientelist – tradition that simply aimed to ensure everyone had a chance of a decent life. [ Former Dublin GAA manager Jim Gavin as Fianna Fáil’s presidential candidate? The pros and consOpens in new window ] Ó Cuív stubbornly plods on with unpopular causes, like visiting republican prisoners in Maghaberry, because he cares about moving them towards useful lives, not how it plays as PR. At the moment Heather Humphreys appears to be the front-runner. Despite Martin’s relentless focus on bringing women into politics, why does he judge Fianna Fáil incapable of fielding a seasoned female politician who would appeal in the same way to middle Ireland? Although strong, capable, articulate and intelligent women, neither Deirdre Heenan nor Siofra O’Leary has political experience or name recognition. (I should disclose that I remember O’Leary fondly as a competent and well-liked head girl in the school where I taught.) Fianna Fáil’s last female presidential candidate was closer to the party’s original values. We have to scrape away the intervening years and remember Mary McAleese before she took to accusing mild-mannered Pope Leo of courting Maga money and Pope Francis of being a “careless pope” and “sometimes narky showman.” She was allegedly too much the green nationalist, too divisive to be a good president. Instead, she and her husband, Martin, did much to advance peace in Ireland. Yes, 1997 was a different time, but Fianna Fáil knew the kind of person they wanted, a woman who had contested an election and had a clear vision of the Ireland she wanted to represent. There is a tendency to dismiss the approach of every president before Mary Robinson as having nothing to offer contemporary Ireland. The underrated Patrick Hillery, who incidentally laid most of the groundwork for free education before Donogh O’Malley took his solo run, proved his mettle when it was most needed. When Charles Haughey attempted to pressure his former colleague not to dissolve the Dáil to enable Fianna Fáil to form a government without a new election, Hillery sent him packing and protected an Army officer whom Haughey had tried to intimidate. The “mature recollection” of this incident later derailed Brian Lenihan’s attempt at the presidency. There is something to be said for a president who does not self-identify as an activist. Yet the proposed – at the time of writing – selection of Jim Gavin, while a decent man of solid Clare Fianna Fáil stock, highlights Martin’s obsession with success in Dublin. It also signals that a once-dominant party lacks an electable politician or former politician embodying its core beliefs. What does that say about the party Martin has shaped and his confidence in his colleagues? © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

31 August 2025 Time taken to read : 11 Minute KATHMANDU: Economic Digest offers a concise yet comprehensive overview of significant business happenings in Nepal, presented in easily digestible summaries. The recent developments in Nepal reflect a mix of economic, infrastructural, and regulatory shifts, impacting various sectors. The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) has rebounded with a 23-point gain, signaling improved market sentiment after a period of significant losses. Meanwhile, discussions around opening the electricity trading market to private players are gaining momentum, with the aim of enhancing competition and market expansion. However, monsoon disruptions have heavily affected the country’s transportation infrastructure, blocking nine major highways and complicating travel. On the regulatory front, the Nepal Rastra Bank has tightened guidelines for banks’ Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) spending to ensure more transparent and targeted use of funds. The government is also making strides to exit the FATF grey list by presenting progress on anti-money laundering measures. At the same time, sugarcane farmers have threatened a national highway blockade over unmet demands, highlighting ongoing socio-economic issues. Additionally, Nepal’s increasing reliance on remittances, record gold prices, and developments in agricultural exports to China underscore the country’s economic dynamics. Lastly, while the life insurance sector shows strong growth, the government faces challenges in ensuring consumer protection and addressing infrastructural funding shortfalls in provinces like Karnali. NEPSE rebounds: Index gains 23 points as market sentiment improves The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) gained 23.03 points last week, ending a recent downturn that saw a loss of over Rs 378 billion. The index opened at 2,757.97 on Sunday and closed at 2,781 on Thursday, reaching a high of 2,824.85 and a low of 2,730.74. Ten out of the 13 market sectors saw gains, with the ‘Others’ sector rising by 4.57%. Bikash Hydropower saw a surge of 60.98%, while Narayani Development Bank dropped by 44.46%. Total turnover increased by 8.38% to Rs 32.26 billion, and market capitalization grew to Rs 4.647 trillion, leading to Rs 39 billion in investor gains. Nepal explores private sector entry into electricity trading to boost competition Following a report from the government task force, discussions have begun regarding the opening of Nepal’s electricity trading market to private sector participation. Currently dominated by Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), the proposal suggests that private companies could enhance competition and expand the market. If implemented, provisions under the Electricity Act 2049 would allow private producers to sell power domestically and internationally, potentially through platforms like NepEx or direct market channels. Experts believe that private sector involvement could fast-track development and improve consumer access to affordable, high-quality electricity. Heavy rain disrupts nine major highways across Nepal Heavy rainfall has led to landslides and flooding, blocking nine key highways in Nepal, the Nepal Police reported. The affected roads include the Koshi Highway at Bhotkhola (Sankhuwasabha), the Nepal-China bridge in Rasuwa, Pasang Lhamu Highway (Rasuwa), and Arniko Highway (Sindhupalchowk). Other impacted routes are the Kaligandaki Corridor (Baglung), Beni-Darbang road (Myagdi), Jajarkot road (Rukum Paschim), Bheri Corridor (Dolpa), and Gokuleshwor-Darchula road (Darchula). Some roads, such as parts of the Mid-Hill, Prithivi, and Kaligandaki corridors, remain open for one-way traffic. Authorities continue to monitor the ongoing situation as monsoon-related disruptions affect travel across the nation. NRB tightens rules on bank CSR funds: Transparent, targeted spending now mandatory Nepal Rastra Bank has introduced new regulations to ensure that corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds are used transparently and effectively by banks and financial institutions. Banks must allocate a fixed percentage of their net profit to CSR, with at least 60% spent within the fiscal year. Institutions are required to prepare annual action plans and submit semi-annual reports detailing their CSR activities. The funds can be used to support education, health, environmental protection, financial literacy, and skill development for targeted communities. Nepal advances plan to exit FATF grey list, showcases progress in Tokyo Nepal has officially begun steps to exit the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list after being included in February due to insufficient progress in combating money laundering and terrorism financing. At the Asia-Pacific Group (APG) plenary session in Tokyo, Nepal presented updates on its quarterly action plan. The Nepali delegation, led by PM Office Secretary Phanindra Gautam and Nepal Rastra Bank Deputy Governor Dr. Neelam Dhungana Timilsina, highlighted legal reforms, improved monitoring of high-risk sectors, and new coordination mechanisms. The government remains committed to implementing reforms to secure removal from the grey list. Sugarcane farmers threaten indefinite highway blockade from September 10 Sugarcane farmers from across Nepal, who have been protesting in the capital since August 24 over subsidies and government support, have warned of an indefinite blockade along the national highway in Hariwan, Sarlahi, beginning September 10 if their demands remain unmet. Protest coordinator Shyam Babu Ray emphasized that farmers had endured harsh conditions during the sit-in, yet their calls for help had been ignored. The protest, organized by the Sugarcane Producers Federation of Nepal, opposes subsidy cuts and seeks representation in price determination. Nepalis abroad send Rs 4.72 billion daily, driving record remittance inflows Nepali migrant workers sent a record Rs 1.72 trillion home in the last fiscal year, averaging Rs 4.72 billion daily, according to Nepal Rastra Bank. This represents a 19% year-on-year increase and nearly matches the government’s annual budget. The rise in remittances is attributed to increased outmigration, stronger foreign currencies like the US dollar, and a shift from informal to formal transfer channels. While remittances help uplift households, Nepal remains heavily dependent on foreign earnings due to a sluggish domestic economy and low investment levels. Nepal social media listing standoff: Companies resist due to content control rules Nepal’s Communication Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung has criticized social media giants like Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft for refusing to register under the country’s 2080 BS social media directive. Although these companies are registered for tax purposes, they resist the government’s listing due to concerns over strict content control rules. The directive mandates the removal of content within 24 hours of complaints, which has raised fears of excessive government intervention. The Asia Internet Coalition has highlighted the challenges in enforcing fair content review, and the government has issued a seven-day ultimatum for compliance. Life insurers collect Rs 3.27B in first premiums, Shrawan 2082/83 Nepal’s life insurance sector showed strong performance in Shrawan 2082/83, with companies collectively collecting over Rs 3.27 billion in first premiums. Nepal Life Insurance led the way with Rs 103 crore, followed by National Life (Rs 42.37 crore) and Citizen Life (Rs 25.01 crore). Other top performers included Himalayan Life, SuryaJyoti Life, LIC Nepal, and IME Life, reflecting strong investor interest and sector growth. Gold smashes Rs 200,000 mark in Nepal as prices soar Gold prices soared last week, crossing the Rs 200,000 per tola threshold for the first time, driven by global market trends. Prices rose by Rs 3,100, fluctuating between Rs 197,200 and Rs 200,600 per tola. The surge was driven by US interest rate cuts, a weaker Indian rupee, and increased gold purchases by China, India, and Turkey. Analysts see gold as a safe haven asset amidst market volatility. Silver prices also rose slightly, reaching Rs 2,360 per tola. Nepal seeks Chinese flexibility to boost agricultural exports Nepal has urged China to adopt flexible customs policies to ease exports of buffalo meat, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, and herbs. During a bilateral meeting in Kathmandu, Agriculture Minister Ramnath Adhikari and Chinese Customs Deputy Minister Wang Lingjun discussed the proposal. Nepal is seeking to export thermally processed buffalo meat, ghee, butter, silage, and animal feed, and has asked for concessions on citrus fruit standards. China has acknowledged Nepal’s priority status and agreed to establish a joint trade facilitation mechanism. Currently, 34 Nepali companies export agricultural products to China. IBN approves license draft for 669 MW Lower Arun Hydropower project Investment Board Nepal (IBN) has approved the draft license for the 669 MW Lower Arun Hydropower Project at its 66th meeting, chaired by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. The board also endorsed a draft for direct investment in the Arun-3 Hydropower Project in Sankhuwasabha and authorized the issuance of a survey license for the proposed ‘Auto Service Eco-Industrial Park’ project. The decision is seen as a step toward boosting Nepal’s energy sector. Karnali’s bridge projects face funding shortfall, pushed to multi-year plan The Karnali provincial government has allocated Rs 105 million for seven motorable bridges in Rukum West, but the funds are insufficient. Officials have proposed including the projects in a multi-year plan to secure additional funding. The Infrastructure Development Office in Chaurjahari submitted the proposal to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Urban Development, warning that the bridges might remain incomplete without timely approval. The lack of bridges in key areas is disrupting local travel, schooling, and livelihoods, especially during the monsoon. KMC fines distillery after fly found in sealed Mustang Gold bottle Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) has fined Dhanusha Distillery Pvt. Ltd. Rs 200,000 after a fly was found in a sealed bottle of its Mustang Gold alcoholic beverage. The fine follows a consumer complaint and an inspection by KMC’s Agriculture and Livestock Department. The department confirmed the presence of the inedible object after lab tests. KMC also inspected several other establishments, destroying inedible oil found in four restaurants and one sweet shop.

Title: From GPUs to tokens – How Nvidia’s optimism might influence the Crypto AI sector

The Crypto AI sector has not kept pace with the wider altcoin market’s price gains. Nvidia’s fiscal report has projected sustained revenue growth for the next quarter, while tech companies like MongoDB and Pure Storage closed out a bullish week. Can this affect the Crypto AI sector’s sentiment? Nvidia [NVDA] is in the news today after it reported its Q2 fiscal results for the second quarter ended the 27th of July, 2025. Its revenue of $46.7 billion was up 6% from the previous quarter and 56% higher than a year ago. Its outlook for the third quarter remains bullish, with revenue expected to be as high as $54 billion. Referring to the Nvidia GPU architecture, Founder and CEO Jensen Huang said, “Blackwell is the AI platform the world has been waiting for, delivering an exceptional generational leap — production of Blackwell Ultra is ramping at full speed, and demand is extraordinary.” He added that the “NVLink rack-scale computing is revolutionary” and that the AI race os on. The bullish commentary and the company’s aggressive share repurchase plans could be a sign of greater confidence. That’s not all though as demand hasn’t been slowing down. In fact, the strong growth in the company’s revenue seemed to be in contrast with signs of fatigue in AI-related stocks. Following the fiscal report release earlier in the week, NVDA’s stock saw a 5.95% correction. It fell from Thursday’s high at $184.13 to Friday’s low of $173.17. The generative AI boom in 2022, after the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, meant that GPU manufacturers such as Nvidia and cloud vendors like Microsoft and Google were big winners. There have been some recent winners too, with Enterprise technology company MongoDB noting a 45.7% rally last week. CEO Dev Ittycheria, speaking on CNBC’s Squawk Box, said, “You start to see deployments of agents to automate back office, maybe automate sales and marketing, but it’s still not yet kind of full force in the enterprise.” This statement captures the cautious optimism across the market. As far as Crypto AI tokens are concerned, it could take some time for decentralized AI solutions to gain traction. However, when traditional AI players such as NVDA see a hike in bullish sentiment, there will be some impact on the crypto AI sector. Source: TAO/USDT on TradingView At the time of writing, Bittensor [TAO], the biggest crypto AI token by market capitalization, was down 56% from its December high of $748. Bitcoin’s [BTC] performance since April has not been enough to lead TAO token to recovery either. Source: RENDER/USDT on TradingView Similarly, Render [RENDER] has depreciated by 70% from its December high of $11.9. Together, these two tokens highlighted how the AI token market sentiment may be risk-averse. Even though the altcoin market cap, including Ethereum [ETH], has expanded by nearly 60% since April’s lows, the AI sector has only managed 30%. AI tokens come with high risks, but also high rewards for buyers. Their performance would be dependent on the crypto market sentiment, as well as the wider market’s outlook on AI.

Title: Munster dominate Leinster to win Interpro championship

Munster lifted the Vodafone Women’s Interprovincial Championship trophy for the first time since January 2023, delivering a dominant performance to beat Leinster 50-15 at Energia Park. It was a disappointingly one-sided final, but that should not take away from Munster’s sizzling seven-try display as they cruised past the three-in-a-row hopefuls Leinster, even without injured top try scorer Chisom Ugwueru and vice-captain Stephanie Nunan. A barnstorming first-half performance from Matt Brown’s side had them leading 31-0 at the break, with Chloe Pearse, in her final appearance in red, Deirbhile Nic a Bháird (2), and Aoife Corey sharing out the tries. Centre Caitríona Finn, the player-of-the-match for the third time in the Championship, tallied up 20 points in all, really stamping her mark on the game after only making her first senior start for Munster three weeks ago. Tries from Munster captain Maeve Óg O’Leary, Finn, and Eilís Cahill made it 50 unanswered points, before Leinster, whose new head coach Ben Martin handed out 20 debuts across the four-match series, gained some late consolation. Harder hit by their Rugby World Cup representation, and perhaps also by last week’s tough encounter with Connacht, the defending champions rallied with tries from replacement Katie Whelan (63 and 73 minutes), and Vicky Elmes Kinlan (80). Munster, who had already won 33-22 in Donnybrook in round 2, lost both O’Leary and Gráinne Burke to the sin bin during the final quarter, but their efforts over the opening hour had made certain of a clean sweep of victories, and their 16th Interprovincial crown overall. The title winners’ tight nucleus of senior players, led by inspirational backrower O’Leary, who had a fantastic return to the Interprovincial stage after two knee surgeries, combined very effectively with their emerging young talent this summer.

Title: Historic Flip: Bitcoin ETFs On Pace To Surpass Gold ETFs In AUM

Time Published: 2025-08-30T20:00:16Z

In the dynamic financial sector, Bitcoin ETFs are rapidly gaining ground against their gold counterparts, with inflows pushing total assets under management toward record highs. Bitcoin ETFs are set to overtake gold ETFs in total assets under management. Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are on the brink of making history globally. In an X post, the Kobeissi Letter, an industry-leading commentary on global capital markets, has revealed that BTC ETFs are on track to surpass Gold ETFs in assets under management (AUM) for the first time in history, marking a historic milestone in global markets. Over the past 12 months, AUM in the largest cryptocurrency ETFs has doubled to $150 billion, while gold ETFs have climbed 40% to a record of $180 billion. The comparison highlights how rapidly momentum has shifted. Just three years ago, gold ETFs were five times larger than Bitcoin ETFs. Presently, with accelerating inflows into digital asset products, that gap is narrowing at a historic speed. If current trends continue, Bitcoin ETFs could surpass gold ETFs as early as next year. This is a symbolic flip that underscores the rise of crypto from speculative asset to mainstream portfolio allocation. Lately, ETFs are proving to be the engine behind the current crypto bull market. According to Ucan_Coin, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, oversees nearly 2,000 funds, with about 1,400 of them being ETFs. Clients buy into these funds, while BlackRock earns fees on the assets under management. However, the Bitcoin Spot ETF fee is just 0.25%, but the power lies in scale and liquidity. Over the last two years, ETFs have provided the critical fuel for this rally, with nearly 20% of all liquidity entering crypto now flowing directly from ETF products. As Ucan_Coin highlights, BlackRock’s IBIT stands out. As the chart demonstrates, IBIT is the locomotive pulling the entire market, driving inflows and setting the pace for the broader bull run. The US spot Bitcoin ETFs are gaining remarkable momentum, while generating $5 to $10 billion in daily volume on their most active trading days. Pushpendra Singh, Co-founder of PushpendraTech and SmartViewAi, has explained that this surge is a clear sign that institutional investors are increasingly seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin, and ETFs are rapidly becoming their preferred gateway. Despite the ETF boom, Binance continues to dominate the spot market, processing between $10 to $18 billion in daily spot volume and holding a 29% market share. This is more than double the 13% market share currently held by US-based ETFs, and it puts Binance comfortably ahead of other major exchanges in terms of liquidity.

Title: Reframing Jensen’s Law: ‘Buy more, make more’ and AI factory economics
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/08/30/reframing-jensens-law-buy-make-ai-factory-economics/
Time Published: 2025-08-30T19:59:12Z

UPDATED 15:59 EDT / AUGUST 30 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante We believe the industry’s broad interpretation of Jensen’s Law — “Jensen’s Law accelerates Moore’s Law” — understates a fundamental economic reality of artificial intelligence factories. Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s own language and Nvidia’s operating model point to a financial law of motion for AI factories: When power is the binding constraint and demand is elastic, performance per watt increases raise monetizable throughput faster than they raise total cost. The result is an extension to existing laws of tech that we’ve come to know. Specifically, Huang’s invoking of Buy more to make more (that is, revenue up) and buy more to save more (unit cost down) has explicit economic implications that we believe need further examination. In addition, there is a corollary in this new regime in that, under certain conditions, fabric‑driven utilization unlocks are so valuable that high‑speed networking becomes “economically free” (where utilization gains exceed amortized fabric cost). In this Breaking Analysis, we explain in detail what we’re referring to as a new Jensen’s Law. We’ll explore why this phenomenon is so important, review the math behind it, share some concrete examples of where the law is applicable, when the corollary of “the network is free” holds, implications for investors and operators — and where the law is not applicable. Note on scope and conditions. Our interpretation of Jensen’s law applies primarily to power-limited AI factories operating at high utilization on communication-heavy training and long-context inference workloads, with elastic demand and operator-retained margins. Outside these conditions (for example, capex-limited or demand-limited sites or batchable inference, or where vendor rents are constrained by poor operating leverage), the relationship weakens or can even invert. In this research note, we refer to our interpretation of Jensen’s Law, Jensen’s law, the new Jensen’s law or true Jensen’s law and use them interchangeably. As we move beyond single-shot prompts, reasoning and agentic AI multiplies compute per task (100X-1,000X according to Nvidia and other sources). We hear all the time that data centers are increasingly power‑constrained. Nvidia’s GB300/NVLink 72/Spectrum‑X stack explicitly targets tokens per watt as the metric to optimize along with improving achieved utilization. The assumption is, together, these variables directly allow AI customers to monetize power‑limited factories. Remember, our interpretation of Jensen’s law assumes a new dollar of spend is worth it only if the lifetime extra revenue from better efficiency and utilization is bigger than the lifetime extra costs, after accounting for risk. With that as context, let’s look at some of the supporting statements from Nvidia’s Q2 FY2026 call on Aug. 27. The core of Jensen’s Law is that performance per watt drives revenue. In a power-limited data center, the number of tokens you can produce in a year is directly tied to how efficient you are. Or as Huang (pictured above) put it: “Performance per watt drives directly to revenues… the more you buy, the more you grow.” On the latest earnings call, Nvidia cited massive efficiency gains — 10 to 50 times more energy efficiency with GB300 versus Hopper, depending on configuration and the use of FP4 precision and NVLink 72. Nvidia gave no indications of workloads, configurations or levels of accuracy, which we’ll continue to research. Nonetheless, we heard concrete return-on-investment proof points. Nvidia cited an example where $3 million spend on GB200 infrastructure generated $30 million in token revenue. That’s a 10X return, presumably not a model, but actual operating data from the likes of Microsoft Corp. and OpenAI (not cited specifically). And networking is playing a much bigger role. Nvidia’s stack itself spans all three dimensions: NVLink for scale-up inside the rack, Spectrum-X Ethernet and InfiniBand for scale-out across clusters, and Spectrum-XGS for scale-across multisite AI factories. By lifting network utilization from about 65% toward 85% to 90%, the company argues that “networking is effectively free” because the throughput gain more than covers the fabric cost. Our interpretation here is networking can be economically free in communication-heavy environments where utilization gains are greater than fabric cost. Put in context with spending, Nvidia claims the “Big 4” hyperscalers (big three of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, plus Meta Platforms Inc.) are on pace to spend about $600 billion this year on data centers, a figure we peg lower, at just north of $400 billion – nonetheless, still huge. Perhaps Nvidia is sizing the entire data center buildout spend, which still exceeds our estimates. Nvidia sizes the remaining decade’s AI infrastructure build at $3 trillion to $4 trillion, which also are significantly higher than our market projections — but still huge and this is the capex flywheel Jensen is pointing to. Perhaps Jensen has better visibility on demand than we do. The common usage in the press (for example, IEEE Spectrum, the WSJ, Tom’s Hardware and others) positions “Jensen’s Law” as Nvidia’s acceleration beyond Moore’s Law — shorter cycles and outsized generation‑over‑generation gains. That’s directionally spot on, but we want to put a finer point on the law. In our view, the missing lever is one of economics. Our premise today is there’s a version of Jensen’s Law that is more than just marketing and it relates to the economics of AI Factories. Let’s review the core principle that’s emerging in the economics of AI factories. In a power-limited environment, every incremental dollar of spend that improves performance per watt and fabric efficiency drives monetizable throughput — tokens per second — faster than it raises total cost. That dynamic leads to two outcomes: Further, when utilization gains at the fabric level are significant, high-speed networking becomes economically free. The throughput lift outweighs the amortized cost of the networking gear. This of course is dependent on the existing utilization assumptions, the workload and the potential gains in utilization. This framing ties directly back to some of the classic laws of technology economics as shown on the right-hand side of the graphic above. What’s new is that these principles are being operationalized specifically for power-limited AI factories, and we’re anchoring them with explicit revenue math, which we’ll share shortly. That’s the shift — moving from abstract laws of progress to concrete, financial drivers of the AI economy. It might be helpful to review these classical laws, and we’ll tie them into our new interpretation of Jensen’s Law. The following is a brief summary of the laws shown above and the role they play in the new Jensen’s Law as we’ve described: Moore’s Law: speaks to device scaling and feeds the performance/watt gains – that is, the more tokens you can produce per year at a fixed power envelope the better the economics. Wright’s Law: cost declines by a constant as cumulative volume doubles – this explains the cost/token falling a deployments scale – core to the “save more” side of the equation. Metcalfe’s Law: value grows exponentially as a function of connectivity. This speaks to the network utilization – scale up, scale out, scale across, making networking economically “free.” Jevons’ Paradox: efficiency increases consumption and supports the flywheel effects of Jensen’s Law as we’ve defined it. Let’s break down the math behind our interpretation of this new Jensen’s Law. We can boil it down to three things: how many tokens you can generate, how much revenue those tokens produce, and what each token costs to make. Start with throughput — tokens per year. That’s a function of four variables: the power budget, the amount of operating time in a year, the efficiency of the system — meaning tokens per unit of energy — and how well you can utilize the cluster. Put those together, and the formula is as follows: [Tokens per year = power X efficiency X utilization.] Once you know throughput, revenue is just a matter of multiplying tokens by dollars per token. That gives you the top line. [Revenue = tokens X dollars per token.] Now let’s look at the cost side of the equation. Cost per token is your total annualized expense — servers, racks, networking, cooling, electricity, staff, real estate — divided by tokens per year. In other words, take capex plus energy plus other operating expenses and spread it across your token output. [Cost per token = capex (annualized) + energy costs + other opex​/annual token output.] Finally, gross margin. That’s one minus cost per token over price per token. Put simply, the more efficient you are at generating tokens and keeping the system utilized, the more your margin expands. [1-cost per token/price per token.] So when we say performance per watt times utilization equals revenue, this is the math. It’s not just a marketing slogan when the conditions are right, rather it’s a financial model for AI factories. Here’s a simplified graphic that lays this out more clearly: Jensen’s economic argument for networking goes something like this: If you buy more on a faster fabric, better cooling, or smarter software and it improves efficiency or utilization enough, then the extra revenue from more tokens will outweigh the extra cost of that upgrade. If efficiency and utilization gains are greater than the added costs…buy more, make more applies, because cost per token also falls… leading to buy more, save more. When efficiency cuts unit cost, you can charge less per token. If demand is elastic (customers want more when it’s cheaper), revenue grows even faster — reinforcing the Jensen flywheel as we discussed earlier. Let’s put this in a picture and look at the value flow of Jensen’s Law – “Follow the Money.” To do so,we’ll put our version of Jensen’s Law in plain language. Think of an AI factory like a cafeteria. The cafeteria has ovens (GPUs), cooks (software) and a delivery system (networking). The point is to serve as many meals (tokens) as possible every day, while keeping costs low and making money. Here’s the flow shown in the chart above: So the new Jensen’s Law is: Buy more to upgrade the cafeteria, and you’ll either serve more meals (make more) or serve each meal cheaper (save more). If both happen, your profit gets a double whammy. Networking fits right in. Better networking is like upgrading the cafeteria’s conveyor belts so every oven stays busy. Even if conveyor belts cost extra, they pay for themselves because the cafeteria serves way more meals. That’s why Nvidia says the “network is free.” The loop on the right is the accretive-spend rule. It means: So the test is: Does the revenue uplift from higher efficiency/utilization outweigh the added cost of the upgrade? The key is you have to take a systems view, which is something that Jensen always stresses – “we’re don’t just build chips, we build systems.” This is a key part of Nvidia’s moat, which is underappreciated in our view. If one part of the system is optimized (for example, more ovens create more meals) but the conveyor belt is not fast enough then the system is out of balance and revenue is not maximized. Nvidia’s Q2 results included some proof points for our interpretation of Jensen’s Law. The company gave several examples showing how new architectures and fabrics translate directly into revenue multiples and lower costs per token. Below is our take on some of those. First, reasoning and agentic AI: Unlike simple chatbots, these agents plan, use tools and iterate. That makes workloads 100 to 1,000 times more compute-intensive, which means efficiency and utilization gains matter a lot more. A key question to ask here is how is Nvidia accounting for utilization? For example, how does the calculation account for multi-tenant overheads, queueing efficiency, I/O fragmentation and restarts? Second, GB300 with NVLink 72: At rack scale, it delivers about 10X the tokens per watt compared to Hopper. With four-bit floating point math, energy efficiency improves up to 50X per token. CoreWeave Inc. says it’s already seeing 10X better inference on reasoning models in production. We’d be interested in details around what tokenization standards are most productive? What Quality of Service limits (if any) were in place to achieve these 10X to 50X claims? Third, the fabric story: Networking isn’t a side note, it’s fundamental to the economics. Spectrum-X Ethernet is already running at a $10 billion rate, and NVLink 72 gives you 14X the bandwidth of PCIe Gen5. That’s why Jensen says the network is effectively free — because if utilization gains outweigh the cost – it is economically free. We’d like to understand this further in terms of what reasonable incremental revenue over the fabric costs would constitute “free.” In other words, what kind of save NPV:Fabric TCO ratio should operators assume to achieve that economic freedom? Is it 1X? 2X? 3X – what is a reasonable cushion to guarantee results? Fourth, the $3 million to $30 million example. Jensen cited a real case where a $3 million spend on infrastructure produced $30 million in token revenue. That’s the “buy more, make more” flywheel in action. Key questions we have include: What was the time window in which this benefit was achieved – i.e. is this a snapshot benefit or one that is sustainable over a period of time? What were the price/token assumptions? What’s a reasonable range of benefit (we assume 10X is a best case scenario for marketing purposes)? And finally, cadence. Nvidia is shipping new architectures every year — Blackwell to Rubin and beyond. Each one drives higher performance per watt, higher utilization and higher revenue. It’s compounding economics. A key issue we see here is if a new Nvidia generation hits before I realize my payback (for example, I hit delays which is a clear risk) and the value of my infrastructure tanks I’m left with a failed business case and will get fired. We see this as especially pressing as AI moves from hyperscale/cloud to enterprise and edge. Bottom line: Nvidia isn’t just selling chips; it’s proving the economic engine of our version of Jensen’s Law. Heavier workloads drive the value of efficiency improvements higher, fabrics keep the graphics processing units busy, and each architecture turn compounds the “buy more, make more” cycle. But operators and enterprise customers must cut through the marketing hype, understand their unique environment and how Nvidia’s impressive claims translate into value for them. We were somewhat surprised by investor reaction to Nvidia’s latest earnings print. Other than a hit to free cash flow margin, we thought the quarter was quite remarkable. And Nvidia addressed the free cash flow in comments about its days sales outstanding, which to us was of no concern. From an investor perspective, Jensen’s Law changes four things in our view as bulleted above and described in more detail below. First, the unit of competition is no longer the chip, it’s the AI factory. What matters is system-level performance per watt and utilization, which rewards rack-scale designs, integrated fabrics, software and cadence. Second, networking isn’t overhead, it can be a profit lever. Utilization gains are so significant that fabric routinely pays for itself — often multiple times over. The caveat is the conditions have to be right. They are today for the large hyperscalers. Will this translate to mainstream enterprises to the same degree? Third, pricing power is being redefined by elasticity. If elasticity exists, as cost per token collapses, providers can still grow revenue by lowering prices, because demand expands even faster. Note: Operators must take the risk that elasticity is greater than 1 (that is, as price drops customers will buy enough to grow revenue). We’re seeing some positive signs in the scramble for capacity and the shift to reasoning workloads – indicating an insatiable appetite for AI services. The caveat here is price per token is ever-changing and very quickly. Often it’s a race to zero between API pricing, free tiers, price cuts, advertising subsidies and the like. The operator’s margin will be affected by these dynamics, which can alter the outcome. And fourth, cadence is a cash machine. Nvidia’s product cadence isn’t just about faster chips, it’s about turning capital spending into a recurring monetization flywheel. Each year, new architectures deliver higher efficiency (more tokens per watt) and better utilization (keeping clusters busier). That combination means every dollar of capex spent on GPUs, networking, and racks generates more revenue in the following cycle. But a key consideration for investors is the degree to which customers can move at the speed of Nvidia. Clearly the hyperscalers and Meta, X.ai, the neoclouds and some service providers can keep up. But mainstream enterprises will struggle to maintain pace. If and when the capex gusher dries up, enterprises and new uses cases like robotics will be the growth engine. The dynamics in these markets will be different. Nonetheless, in today’s hyperscale-led market this is what Jensen means when he says: “the more you buy, the more you grow.” Customers that continually reinvest ride the curve of annual improvements, effectively compounding returns with each generation. We believe this flywheel is in place until the end of this decade at least. Here’s how we think operators should measure Jensen’s Law in the field. First, tokens per joule — true efficiency is rising fast, 10 to 50 times in some cases. Second, utilization — some operators claim clusters run 15% to 25% more efficiently with NVLink 72 and Spectrum-X. Third, power allocation — when the megawatt cap can be flat, every gain in performance per watt drops straight to revenue. Fourth, token price and demand — as price falls, demand rises, and so does revenue (Jevons’ Paradox) Fifth, payback time — some builds now recover in under a year. And finally, fabric mix — NVLink 72 domains are scaling, and XGS (data center to data center) is just starting to emerge. We believe the AI factory math is compelling, but only under strict operating conditions. Jensen’s new Law isn’t guaranteed. There are risks and conditions where it may not hold. First, if a data center isn’t power-limited, then performance per watt isn’t as tightly tied to revenue. Second, if token prices fall faster than efficiency and utilization rise, growth stalls — especially if demand isn’t elastic. Third, workloads matter. If the model isn’t sensitive to fabric speed or collective operations, the return on fabric spend moderates. Fourth, practical constraints like supply chain delays, power or cooling bottlenecks can push out the payoff. Fifth, If alternative stacks or application-specific integrated circuits start to match Nvidia’ end-to-end efficiency, then the economics begin to normalize. The following specific details should be monitored over time in our view: Efficiency claims of 10X to 50X must be validated end-to-end, taking into consideration tokens per joule at accuracy and latency parity. This should be measured at the system level, not on a single GPU. Further, business cases should assume headroom with returns of 3X to 5X over cost to account for the risks. Utilization uplift is equally nuanced. Gains of 15 to 25 points from NVLink 72 and Spectrum-X are real for collective-heavy training and long-context inference, but may be negligible on parallel inference. Operators should expect meaningful sustained improvement over many weeks under production load before scaling. Remember, performance per watt only translates to revenue if power is the binding constraint. If capacity is capped by capex or demand, the linkage weakens. In our opinion, upgrades should proceed only when power will be a constraint for 12 to 24 months. Have high confidence that incremental throughput will be consumed – or ideally is presold. Elasticity assumptions must be grounded. Revenue uplift from price cuts applies only where elasticity is greater than 1. Otherwise, protect margins with tiered QoS. Similarly, sub-year paybacks depend on high utilization, stable token pricing and on-time installations. Our research indicates many investments face unforeseen delays. Assume higher internal rate of return/hurdle rates and longer payback periods in business cases. Operators must retain margin uplifts. In our view, upgrades are accretive only when power is constrained, utilization lifts are proven, demand is elastic, and the surplus accrues to the operator —not only to the infrastructure supplier. Finally, this interpretation of Jensen’s Law works well for hyperscalers and consumer Internet companies. It’s unclear how well it translates to enterprise AI and edge customers. We’ll dig into that as those markets evolve. These are the stress points we need to watch. Hopefully our reframe of Jensen’s Law is clear. The shorthand of “Moore’s Law on steroids” is catchy but incomplete. The economics show that in power-limited AI factories, efficiency (tokens per joule) and utilization (keeping clusters busy) are the true revenue levers. When those improve faster than costs rise, two dynamics follow: Buy more to make more, and buy more to save more. Earnings calls continue to supply supporting evidence: Nvidia cites 10X to 50X efficiency gains, examples of $3 million in infrastructure yielding $30 million in token revenue, and fabric-driven utilization lifts that can make networking effectively free. But we caution that these outcomes only hold under strict conditions —measured end-to-end at the system level, with sustained utilization improvements, when power is truly the limiting constraint; and where demand elasticity supports revenue growth rather than price erosion. For investors and operators, the actionable takeaway is to judge vendors by factory economics, not chip specs alone. The durable winners will be those who compound efficiency and utilization year after year, with software and fabrics carrying as much weight as silicon — while ensuring the efficiency margins accrue to the operator, not just the supplier.

RTÉ Sport contributor Munster lifted the Vodafone Women's Interprovincial Championship trophy for the first time since January 2023, delivering a dominant performance to beat Leinster 50-15 at Energia Park. It was a disappointingly one-sided final, but that should not take away from Munster's sizzling seven-try display as they cruised past the three-in-a-row hopefuls Leinster, even without injured top try scorer Chisom Ugwueru and vice-captain Stephanie Nunan. A barnstorming first-half performance from Matt Brown's side had them leading 31-0 at the break, with Chloe Pearse, in her final appearance in red, Deirbhile Nic a Bháird (2), and Aoife Corey sharing out the tries. Centre Caitríona Finn, the player-of-the-match for the third time in the Championship, tallied up 20 points in all, really stamping her mark on the game after only making her first senior start for Munster three weeks ago. Tries from Munster captain Maeve Óg O'Leary, Finn, and Eilís Cahill made it 50 unanswered points, before Leinster, whose new head coach Ben Martin handed out 20 debuts across the four-match series, gained some late consolation. Harder hit by their Rugby World Cup representation, and perhaps also by last week's tough encounter with Connacht, the defending champions rallied with tries from replacement Katie Whelan (63 and 73 minutes), and Vicky Elmes Kinlan (80). Munster, who had already won 33-22 in Donnybrook in round 2, lost both O'Leary and Gráinne Burke to the sin bin during the final quarter, but their efforts over the opening hour had made certain of a clean sweep of victories, and their 16th Interprovincial crown overall. The title winners' tight nucleus of senior players, led by inspirational back rower O'Leary, who had a fantastic return to the Interprovincial stage after two knee surgeries, combined very effectively with their emerging young talent this summer.

It’s Labor Day weekend, which means big deals on car lots across America – especially if you’re shopping for a new electric vehicle to help with your labor. We’ve rounded up the best offers on electric pickups, vans, and even a great option for ride share drivers! Sure, there’s a bit of irony in pitching “work vehicles” on a holiday meant for not working – but for many small business owners, work is part of who they are. And with the $7,500 federal EV tax credit set to expire, plus a wave of great Labor Day deals on work-ready EVs, now might be the best time yet to plug into a new electric ride. Here are some of the standout electric vehicles offers we found this Labor Day weekend (2025), organized by vehicle type. The “Ford for America,” summer sales event continues through Labor Day with interest-free 0% financing, $0 down payment, and zero payments for up to 90 days for retail customers. Ford is also throwing in $0 maintenance for 24 months. But wait, there’s more! Ford Authority is reporting that a complimentary home charger and standard installation might also be included as part of the Ford Power Promise promotion happening at participating dealers in select markets with the purchase of a new F-150 Lightning pickup through the end of September. Lease customers aren’t being left out, either. You can lease a 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning XLT 4P 311A pickup at $399 per month for 36 months, with “just” $399 due at signing (basically your first month’s payment). The best electric vehicle deal in the business keeps on truckin’ into Labor Day weekend, with new 2025 Brightdrop models currently eligible for up to $21,500 in manufacturer rebates before any Federal, state, local utility, or even Costco membership incentives kick in. For your money, you get a capable, Ultium-based electric cargo van with more room than your college dorm and a nationwide dealer network to keep it up and running when you need it most. Despite being based on the company’s existing diesel platform, Mercedes’ eSprinter has proven itself a capable urban hauler in the hands of Amazon, DHL, and countless European tradespeople. Despite that, there are still a handful of leftover 2024 models hanging around dealer lots – enough that Mercedes is offering up to $30,000 (!) Customer Cash on any new ’24MY eSprinter purchased from dealer stock. That discount is enough to bring the price of this 2024 eSprinter in Chicago from $87,823 all the way down to $57,823 this Labor Day weekend – and that’s before you factor in state and local utility incentives that can bring the price down even further. As you can imagine, there’s some fine print on that Customer Cash deal. It can’t be combined with Special APR programs through Mercedes-Benz Financial Services (MBFS), but it can be combined with the Mercedes-Benz Commercial Vehicles Medium Fleet Program. Ride share drivers looking for comfortable seats, room for five adults and their luggage, proven battery life, and lickety-quick charging speeds can stop looking. Volkswagen is offering a sweet ID.4 lease at nearly half the cost of an entry-level Jetta with payments starting at just $129/mo. – that’s despite the ID.4 carrying a significantly higher MSRP. And, while we’re at it, it’s probably worth noting that serious road warriors will probably save more than $129/mo. in fuel alone. If you prefer to own your vehicles after making payments on them for a few years, you can also get 0% interest financing on select ID.4s for up to 72 months. It’s important to note here that Volkswagen’s deals can vary wildly by region. That $129/mo. offer is available in California and a few other West Coast states, for example, but the electric crossover’s listed at $329 for 24 months with $4,499 due at signing in others. Disclaimer: the vehicle models and financing deals above were sourced from CarsDirect, CarEdge, and (where mentioned) the OEM websites – and were current as of 29AUG2025. These deals may not be available in every market, with every discount, or for every buyer (the standard “with approved credit” fine print should be considered implied).

Can Ethereum sustain its dominance over all altcoin sectors, or is this outperformance nearing its limit? Ethereum outperformed other altcoin sectors as supply shrank and whale bets mounted. With transactions hitting records and ETH rebounding, the question remains: can this momentum spark a sustained rally? Ethereum [ETH] traded higher on the daily chart, logging modest gains over the past 24 hours. The altcoin continued to steer the season, extending its outperformance against Bitcoin [BTC]. The altcoin’s rally has been fueled by whale and institutional accumulation, with retail also joining the train. Most of the altcoin sectors had, however, shifted back to closing in the red. Comparing ETH to other altcoin sectors, it showed clear leadership this month. ETH led with a performance reading of 0.20, slightly higher than those of Layer 2s (L2) and DeFi tokens. By mid-August, DeFi and L2s briefly led, but ETH reclaimed the lead into month-end. Naturally, DePin and AI tokens trailed just below. Source: Glassnode As Q3 2025 closed in, sectors such as gaming, AI, and staking posted losses. In fact, Ethereum stood out as the leader of capital rotation. On the weekly price action, ETH wicked to $4,900 before rejection. The spike signaled a potential rally, breaking a double top near $4,000. Recent price action tested the $4,400 zone, a recovery from the dip below $4,300. As of press time, ETH was only up by about 13%. Source: TradingView If ETH advanced toward $4,800, large liquidation clusters could trigger resets. On top of that, $7.23 billion in ETH short positions risked a squeeze, potentially propelling the price toward $5,000. Additionally, the supply of Ethereum was shrinking with whales, institutions, and retail scooping up more ETH. In fact, staking contributed to the supply shock, with nearly 30% of ETH staked. BlackRock reportedly accumulated nearly $1 billion worth of ETH over a week. Meanwhile, a whale went long on Hyperliquid with 25x leverage at $4,380, building a $4.39 million position, per CryptOpus. More importantly, the monthly transaction count hit a new ATH of 46.99 million with still a day left. This was in play despite the month of August seeing a reduction in gains. Source: Ted Pillows/X DEX volume stood at $135 billion, while TVL reached $240 billion. Moreover, Active Addresses surpassed 15 million. Altogether, Ethereum stayed ahead of its peers, with strong on-chain momentum reinforcing its dominance.

As investments in artificial intelligence continue to soar, some analysts are raising alarms about a looming bubble that could burst and trigger broader market declines. Others, however, say they’ve never been so sure that it is a growing opportunity. So who is right? Well, on Wall Street, there’s a pick-your-flavor opinion for whatever it is you want to back, so we can’t determine that. But we can show you what each side is thinking. Firstly, that the sector is overvalued. Analysts and investors and even company CEOs of AI giants have expressed concerns that current valuations of AI-related stocks may be disconnected from their underlying fundamentals. The rapid rally in companies involved in AI hardware, software, and infrastructureâincluding chipmakers, cloud providers, and automation firmsâhas driven valuations to levels that many consider unsustainable. Why does that matter? Because everything that goes up must eventually come down. That means that recent market volatility and warnings from veteran investors suggest that a sudden reassessment of valuations could result in a significant downturn, similar to past technology and internet bubbles. Secondly, that growth is why those valuations are worth it. Despite recent concerns about overvaluation and a possible slowdown in AI-related growth, UBS analysts reaffirmed their positive outlook on the sector this week, buoyed by Nvidiaâs hotly anticipated quarterly results. In a note released after Nvidia reported earnings that exceeded expectations (but only just barely), UBS said that the core case for AI investment remains intact. âWhile valuations might appear stretched in the short term, the fundamental need for AI technology across industries continues to grow,â UBS wrote in a note to investors. The firm highlighted Nvidiaâs role as a leader in semiconductor and AI infrastructure, emphasizing that the companyâs robust revenue growth, which is projected at 48% for the current quarter, is a sign for ongoing demand for AI hardware and software solutions. Analysts also pointed out that the broader enterprise move toward integrating AI is supported by increasing capital spending, which bodes well for the sectorâs long-term prospects. âInvestors should maintain conviction,â UBS added, âas the demand for scalable, high-performance AI platforms is only poised to accelerate.â Market experts agree that while short-term volatility is inevitable, the fundamental structural drivers, such as the adoption of AI in cloud computing, autonomous vehicles, and enterprise AI, suggest the sectorâs growth story remains robust for the foreseeable future. Not everyone is as bullish on AI as UBS. Take OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, a man who is watching billions of dollars being poured into his competitors. Altman caused a major market rout when he said that investors are getting “over-excited” about AI. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are over-excited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes,” He toldÂ The Verge, adding that he thinks that some valuations of AI start-ups are “insane” and “not rational”. Investors are also increasingly wary after reports that Meta is considering a âdownsizingâ of its artificial intelligence division, with some executives expected to depart. This potential shift marks a notable departure from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerbergâs recent heavy investments in transforming the companyâs AI operations. Over the past few months, Zuckerberg has championed a major overhaul of Metaâs AI strategy, emphasizing its critical role in enhancing user experience and competing with rivals like OpenAI and Google. The New York Times cited sources close to the company, indicating that the restructuring could lead to significant layoffs or a shakeup in leadership. The planned changes have raised questions among market watchers about whether Metaâs aggressive AI ambitions are being reassessed, or if internal challenges are forcing a strategic pivot. The move signals a period of uncertainty for Metaâs AI efforts, which had been a key part of Zuckerbergâs vision for the companyâs future growth While some experts acknowledge the transformative potential of AI, they caution investors to remain vigilant and avoid chasing speculative gains that lack proper valuation. âThe risk is that we are in a man-made bubble that will eventually burst, causing widespread damage,â said industry veteran Michael Johnson. “Even when the dotcom bubble burst, there were a handful of fairly obvious winners that eventually came roaring back,” saidÂ CNBC‘s Jim Cramer. “If you gave up on Amazon in 2001, you missed the $2 trillion (Â£1.4 trillion) boat.” Cramer has been investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission at least once, and has also drawn criticism for past comments on market manipulation. artificial intellienceemerging technologies Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

A round-up of the biggest tech-related news that stood out this week. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. News Weekly is our column where we highlight and summarize some of the week's top stories so you can catch up on the latest tech news. This is Android Central's News Weekly, your go-to source for a concise roundup of the week's most significant tech stories. This is where we delve into the top headlines that provide the latest developments and innovations contributing to the digital landscape. This week, Samsung announced another Unpacked event, a Pixel 10 battery feature you can't turn off, Nothing gets caught in the middle of a stock photo scandal, Samsung XR headset's launch could be on the horizon, and everything we know so far about the upcoming Galaxy S25 FE. Read more here Samsung announced this week that it will launch another set of devices soon at its Virtual Unpacked event on Sept 4 at 5 p.m. ET. We may have an idea of what is ahead of us, considering the leaks that have been coming in; however, the teaser hints at nothing more than the arrival of "new" devices. So far, we've had official launches for the Galaxy Buds 3 FE and the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite. Both products have joined Samsung's budget-friendly offerings, and they will also be showcased during this event. Additionally, we've been seeing rumors about a Galaxy S25 FE, another budget phone, as well as the Galaxy Tab S11, along with an alleged Ultra version. We have a pretty packed lineup ahead of us, and the curtain rises next week! Those interested can watch from the Samsung Newsroom, Samsung.com, or the company's YouTube channel. Read more here Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Google's new flagship is here, but here's the catch: apparently, this time around, the tech giant says the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro/XL have a battery feature that's locked and loaded onto the device that users can't disable. The feature called "Battery Health Assistance," introduced on the Google Pixel 9a, is designed to slow down your battery's aging by reducing charging speed and voltage. This feature activates after 200 charge cycles on the Pixel 10 series. Google claims this slow adjustment helps the battery age more evenly and maintain stable performance over time. While this should make your battery last longer, it will also gradually lower your phone's charging speed. This means your device would need to be plugged into the charger for longer, which is a bummer. Read more here Nothing has been caught in the middle of a messy controversy over its marketing of the Phone 3. The tech company was recently spotted using stock images by professional photographers on different cameras, as shots taken on the Phone 3. Android Authority seems to have narrowed down five images that were supposedly captured by their new flagship devices, but were actually licensed photos. The images in question were licensed stock photos and not, as the company stated, "what our community has captured with the Phone (3)." Android Central also received an anonymous tip that showcased a screen recording of a Live Demo Unit (LDU) and screenshots of images reportedly taken by the device. The tipster claimed that these images were not authentic, but rather stock photos, backing their claim with links to the Stills platform. Akis Evangelidis, the co-founder of Nothing, took to X to post a lengthy statement, effectively agreeing to the fact that these images were indeed stock photographs, but he clarified that this was an "unfortunate oversight." Read more here According to a new report (via UploadVR and Google Translate), Samsung will allegedly hold a Galaxy Unpacked event in Korea on September 29, where it'll finally launch Samsung's long-awaited project Moohan. The headset recently passed through certification at the Korea Testing & Research Institute, and will launch "sequentially in global markets" starting in Korea on October 13. As for its price, the report claims the headset could cost around 4 million won, or 1 million short of the Apple Vision Pro. Depending on regional pricing, which is about $1,799 to $2,999, putting it well above the Meta Quest 3. We were able to demo Project Moohan at Google I/O, and it basically exceeded expectations with its "immersive visuals and natural navigation through apps via Gemini voice commands. It felt comfortably balanced with a knob fitting it in place, gesture controls were seamless, and app performance was speedy," AC's Senior Editor Michael Hicks added. Read more here A German publication, Nieuwe Mobiel, spotted an early online listing of the alleged Samsung Galaxy S25 FE on a Portuguese website. The website named MediaMarkt uploaded an entire product page for the Galaxy S25 FE, ahead of its alleged Sept. 4 launch. The page, now taken down, allegedly featured official-looking posters that provided more than enough information on what to expect from the phone. Nieuwe Mobiel was quick enough to download all the images and notes that the S25 FE is expected to be "thinner and lighter. The phone is said to feature a 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED display, measuring 7.4mm in width and weighing approximately 190 grams, which is around 20 grams lighter than its predecessor. The images show the alleged Fan edition in a "Navy Blue" colorway, with noticeably thinner bezels around the screen. Other specifications of the device are expected to include a triple camera array and thinner bezels. Those are some of the biggest stories from this week.

Title: Crypto ETF Surge Could Reshape Market, but Many Products May Fail
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/29/crypto-etf-surge-could-reshape-market-but-many-products-may-fail
Time Published: 2025-08-30T14:00:00Z

A deluge of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could hit U.S. markets as early as this fall, potentially changing how both institutional and retail investors access the digital asset space. But while some see it as a turning point for mainstream adoption, others are already bracing for inevitable casualties. “The crypto ETF floodgates are set to open this fall, and investors will soon be swimming in these products,” said Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management. He believes most of the 90-plus crypto ETF applications currently filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will be approved — assuming they meet the final listing requirements. Ultimately, though, said Geraci, investors — not regulators — will decide which products thrive. “The beautiful aspect of the ETF market is that it’s a meritocracy, where investors vote with their hard-earned money. The market naturally sorts out the winners from the losers, so I’m not overly concerned about there being too many crypto ETFs floating around.” To Geraci, the demand for more diverse and accessible investment options is already there — and underappreciated. “Given the initial response to futures-based and 1940 Act-structured Solana and XRP ETFs, I believe demand for 1933 Act spot products in these crypto assets is being severely underestimated – much like we saw with spot bitcoin and ether ETFs,” he said. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), managed and issued by BlackRock, became the most successful ETF launch in the history of those vehicles, now holding nearly $85 billion worth of bitcoin on behalf of investors. While the ether ETFs initially saw much smaller demand than their bitcoin counterparts, a recent surge in interest in the Ethereum blockchain’s native token has seen inflows for the group well surpass those for bitcoin ETFs. Ether ETFs have taken in nearly $10 billion since the start of July, which represents the bulk of total inflows of $14 billion since their launch last year, according to James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Geraci also anticipates strong uptake for index-based crypto ETFs, which he says will give investors and advisors “a straightforward way to gain exposure to the broader digital asset ecosystem.” For smaller, less-known tokens, he admits demand will depend heavily on the strength of each project’s fundamentals. “As you move further down the crypto market cap spectrum, I expect demand for spot ETFs will be more closely tied to the success of individual projects and the performance of their underlying assets — factors that are difficult to forecast at this stage,” he said. Seyffart agrees that the pipeline of crypto-related products is about to burst — but he’s more skeptical about how many will stick. “If all of those filings ultimately launch, there will undoubtedly be some closures within the next few years,” Seyffart said. He expects “decent demand for plenty of these products,” but believes expectations need to be calibrated—especially for altcoins. “I’m not sure that some of these longer tail altcoins will be able to have 5+ successful ETFs,” he said. “If people are gauging their success on the level of bitcoin ETFs — they will be severely disappointed. But if others are expecting all of them to fail — they will also be severely disappointed.” In his view, the market is entering a test phase where issuers will throw many products at the wall to see what sticks. “These issuers are gonna launch a lot of products and try to find something that sticks,” Seyffart said. He predicts the next 12 to 18 months will see “hundreds of crypto-related ETP launches.” Both analysts agree on a central point: the ETF format creates a highly competitive landscape where investor interest is the ultimate arbiter of success. While SEC approval might open the gates, it’s asset flows that will determine who stays afloat. In the ETF world, product closures are a feature — not a flaw. Just like in the stock market, low demand or poor performance can lead funds to shut down. For investors, that means not every new crypto ETF will be worth betting on, even if it carries the name of a popular blockchain project. For example, a Solana ETF might find buyers if the underlying token continues to attract developers and users. But five separate ETFs based on the same coin? That’s where both Seyffart and Geraci say the market will likely intervene. “If demand doesn’t show up, those products will close,” Seyffart said. Behind this boom is the broader institutional acceptance of crypto. Since the SEC approved spot bitcoin and ether ETFs last year, asset managers have rushed to file new offerings tied to Solana SOL$207.82, XRP, dogecoin DOGE$0.2212 and many others and even basket funds tracking multiple coins. These products give traditional investors a regulated way to access crypto markets without setting up wallets or managing private keys. But with that access comes the responsibility to be discerning. “In the end, investors will decide which products make sense and which don’t,” Geraci said. “That’s how the ETF market has always worked.” And with hundreds of crypto funds potentially hitting the market soon, that decision may need to come quickly.

August 30, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Aug. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Altimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT), SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) Class Period: May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Novo lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVO Altimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT) Class Period: August 10, 2023 to June 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 6, 2025 According to the complaint, on June 26, 2025, Altimmune published a press release announcing topline results from the IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial of Pemvidutide in the Treatment of MASH. While defendants had continuously provided inflated expectations ahead of these results, the analysis showed a pointed failure by the Company to achieve statistical significance in its analysis of the fibrosis reduction primary endpoint in its IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial. In particular, while a positive trend in fibrosis improvement was observed, statistical significance was not met due to a higher-than-expected placebo response. When questioned about this concerning miss, defendants answered indifferently, attributing this result to the Phase 2 nature of the trial and stated that Altimmune was hoping for better results following the Phase 3 trial. Following this news, the price of Altimmune’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $7.71 per share on June 25, 2025, Altimmune’s stock price fell to $3.61 per share on June 26, 2025, a decline of 53.2% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Altimmune lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ALT SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) Class Period: September 9, 2020 to May 1, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 10, 2025 On May 1, 2025, at approximately noon eastern standard time, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed a False Claims Act complaint against SelectQuote, alleging, “[f]rom 2016 through at least 2021”1 SelectQuote received “tens of millions of dollars” in “illegal kickbacks” from health insurance companies in exchange for steering Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in the insurers’ plans. Further, SelectQuote, in exchange for kickbacks, engaged in a conspiracy with major insurers to illegally discriminate against beneficiaries deemed to be less profitable, including those with disabilities. The DOJ concluded that SelectQuote made materially false claims by stating it offers “unbiased coverage comparisons” when in fact it “repeatedly directed Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that paid them the most money, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans.” On this news, SelectQuote’s stock price fell $0.61, or 19.2%, to close at $2.56 per share on May 1, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose: (1) that the Company was directing Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that best compensated SelectQuote, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans; (2) that SelectQuote did not provided unbiased comparison shopping for Medicare Advantage insurance plans; (3) that SelectQuote received illegal kickbacks to steer Medicare beneficiaries to certain insurers and limit enrollment in competitors’ plans; (4) that as a result, SelectQuote had not complied with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual provisions; (5) that SelectQuote was vulnerable to regulatory and legal sanctions as a result of its conduct, including claims that it had violated the False Claims Act; and (6) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the SelectQuote lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SLQT Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI) Class Period: March 17, 2022 to September 22, 2022 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 24, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Spectrum’s Pinnacle Study of poziotinib for the treatment of lung cancer was less positive than it portrayed to investors. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period.

Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: Ken Paxton's attack on investors is climate change denial, not conservatism

Time Published: 2025-08-30T12:03:46Z

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton revealed first to 'The Ingraham Angle' that he'll be campaigning for U.S. Senate. Each summer and fall, southern states brace for the destructive force of hurricane season. From Florida to the Carolinas, families face a routine ritual: prepare and pray. But the storms are becoming stronger. The flooding is now more severe, and the economic toll increases every year. In 2024, the United States endured 27 separate weather and climate disasters costing a combined $182.7 billion – one of the costliest years on record. As former Republican congressmen who represented southern districts in Florida and South Carolina, climate change isn’t abstract. Miami is seeing rising tides. North Carolina has been battered by torrential flooding. Energy grids have buckled under record-breaking heat. These risks are real, and they are reshaping our economy, insurance markets and communities. RICK PERRY SAYS KEN PAXTON'S ENERGY LAWSUIT WILL HURT US COAL COMPANIES That is why conservatives must reclaim the climate conversation. Sadly, today’s debate is too often dominated by the loudest partisan voices. On the far left, some prescribe sweeping mandates and federal micromanagement that threaten innovation and growth. On the far right, others—ironically in the name of conservatism—are turning the tools of government against private companies, punishing them for evaluating the financial impacts of climate risk. Take Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s lawsuit against BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard. He claims these firms formed an "investment cartel" by coordinating their consideration of climate risk, effectively conspiring to disadvantage coal producers and traditional energy companies. But that framing badly misrepresents reality. As the Wall Street Journal editorial board noted, coal production increased during the very period Paxton points to — undermining his claim of an anti-energy conspiracy. What he calls collusion is, in fact, routine fiduciary judgment: investors weighing risks and making portfolio choices. That’s not a cartel. That’s an efficient market working as it should. Assessing risk, whether from hurricanes, regulation, or technological disruption, is the essence of responsible investing. If an asset manager concludes that coastal real estate is more vulnerable to flooding, or that insurance payouts are skyrocketing in certain regions, adjusting portfolios accordingly isn’t "woke capitalism." It’s their fiduciary duty. It’s to safeguard the value of their portfolios. It’s exactly how free markets are supposed to function. Some of Texas’s most respected conservative leaders see this clearly. Rick Perry, former governor and energy secretary during the first Trump administration, has criticized Attorney General Paxton’s lawsuit, warning that weaponizing state power against investors undermines the very energy agenda conservatives claim to support. Perry has rightly argued that free markets, not lawsuits and political intimidation, are the best way to ensure American energy security and economic resilience. He argues true freedom means defending the right of businesses and investors to assess risk as they see fit. (Steve Gonzales/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images) Conservatives have long championed the principles of limited government and individual liberty. But when politicians intervene to dictate investment strategies or intimidate firms for recognizing climate risks, they abandon those very principles. The real conservative position is simple: the freedom to invest must be protected. American investors and companies must be able to manage all business risks and opportunities to remain profitable and competitive. Across the country, center-right voices are beginning to step up and lead on this issue. Institutions like the Cato Institute, the National Taxpayers Union, R Street, and federal and state lawmakers are demonstrating how market-based approaches can preserve freedom, drive innovation, and prepare our communities for the realities of climate change. We will all convene later this month in New York City to share how conservatives can chart a path forward. BlackRock offices. (Wikipedia) This is not about choosing between the environment and the economy. It is about unleashing American ingenuity to confront financial risks, create opportunities, and strengthen resilience. Conservatives should be the ones insisting that the marketplace — not government mandates — decides how to adapt and invest for the future. The stakes are clear. If we cede the conversation, the public will be left with a false choice between big-government mandates from the left and big-government meddling from the right. Both are wrong. Conservatives must stand for freedom. For families rebuilding after storms, for entrepreneurs developing clean technologies, and for investors responsibly assessing risks. Here in America, we must firmly defend the freedom to invest. Republican Bob Inglis represented South Carolina’s 4th Congressional District from 1993 to 1999 and then again from 2005 until 2011.

Title: All 7 new products we’re expecting Apple to announce at its ‘Awe Dropping’ September event

Full Content:
Dave Smith is a writer and editor who previously has been published in Business Insider, Newsweek, ABC News, and USA TODAY. Apple’s September 9 “Awe Dropping” event, announced earlier this week, arrives at a critical moment for one of the world’s most valuable companies as it seeks to maintain momentum following strong third-quarter earnings that delivered record revenue of $94 billion. The event, scheduled for 1 p.m. Eastern at Apple’s Cupertino, Calif. headquarters, represents the opening phase of a reported three-year transformation strategy, according to Bloomberg‘s Mark Gurman, that’s designed to reinvent Apple’s hardware ecosystem. The timing carries particular significance as Apple faces mounting challenges in artificial intelligence, where the company has struggled to keep pace with competitors and recently faced an antitrust lawsuit from Elon Musk’s xAI over alleged AI monopolization. Apple’s stock has been hit particularly hard, declining roughly 15-19% so far in 2025, making it the one of the worst performers among the Magnificent Seven tech stocks. The stock lost roughly $75 billion in market value during Apple’s WWDC 2025 keynote in June when the company acknowledged its AI-powered Siri upgrade would be delayed until the following year. Despite these headwinds, Apple’s recent financial performance has shown resilience, with iPhone revenue surging 13.5% to $44.6 billion in the third quarter, partly driven by customers upgrading ahead of potential tariff increases. The September event’s product lineup directly addresses Apple’s strategic priorities by introducing hardware designed to integrate with the company’s Liquid Glass design language: a translucent, depth-focused interface that represents the company’s most significant visual overhaul since iOS 7 in 2013. This design system, inspired by the Vision Pro headset, establishes a unified aesthetic across Apple’s platforms while preparing users for expanded spatial-computing capabilities. The centerpiece of Apple’s September 9 event will reportedly be the ultra-thin iPhone 17 “Air,” which would be the first time an iPhone is bestowed with the moniker that was so popular with Apple’s MacBook line two decades ago. The “Air” model is expected to replace the underperforming iPhone Plus in Apple’s product lineup. The device will reportedly measure approximately 5.5mm at its thinnest point, making it significantly thinner than the iPhone 16’s 7.8mm profile and in all likelihood, given the rumored name, the thinnest iPhone ever made. You can see what it looks like in mock-ups here. The iPhone 17 Air is said to feature a 6.6-inch display supporting 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates, which would be the first time non-Pro iPhones to have this feature that makes your iPhone screen look and feel buttery smooth. The device is rumored to sport a hybrid titanium-aluminum frame and weigh approximately 145 grams, substantially lighter than the iPhone 16 Pro’s 199 grams. However, the ultra-thin design apparently means some compromises. The phone will reportedly only include a single 48-megapixel rear camera and a smaller battery compared to last year’s flagship iPhones. The USB-C port placement is also said to be off-center, and speaker grilles have been simplified to accommodate the slim profile. Color options reportedly include black, white, light gold, and a light blue shade similar to the MacBook Air. Pricing is expected to match the current iPhone Plus at $899. The standard iPhone 17 is rumored to have a better 24-megapixel front-facing camera that doubles the resolution of current models. All iPhone 17 models will reportedly feature ProMotion 120Hz displays, extending this previously Pro-exclusive feature across the entire lineup. The iPhone 17 Pro models will reportedly showcase a new pill-shaped camera bump that’s larger than previous designs, including a 48-megapixel telephoto lens with up to 8x optical zoom; the iPhone 16 Pro is only capable of 5x optical zoom. The Pro models will also transition to primarily aluminum backs instead of glass, improving durability while reducing weight. Color options for the Pro models will reportedly include a pair of new colors hinted at in Apple’s invitations: orange and blue, as well as the more traditional black, white, and silver options. The event’s thermal-inspired logo appears to reference both the new colors and the rumored vapor chamber cooling system designed to prevent overheating during intensive tasks. The Apple Watch Series 11 will apparently emphasize health-monitoring improvements, potentially introducing blood-pressure trend tracking capabilities—though not full systolic and diastolic readings. The feature would detect hypertension patterns and alert users to consult health care professionals. The Series 11 will reportedly come with an updated S11 chip that may be smaller in design to accommodate larger batteries or additional sensors. The watch may also gain 5G RedCap connectivity from MediaTek, according to MacRumors, which would provide faster data speeds than current LTE-only models. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 will reportedly be the first Apple Watch with standalone satellite connectivity, according to Bloomberg‘s Mark Gurman. This feature will enable emergency SOS functionality and potentially text messaging in remote areas without cellular or Wi-Fi coverage. The Ultra 3 is also said to include improved 5G connectivity, and the biggest Apple Watch display to-date, which is said to be brighter and better when viewing it from side angles. And an improved charging coil could enable 80% charging in 30 minutes, according to MacRumors. Apple’s third-generation AirPods Pro will reportedly introduce heart-rate monitoring capabilities, using LED optical sensors that can track your heart rate through blood flow in the ear canal. Beyond health features, the AirPods Pro 3 will include improved Active Noise Cancellation, enhanced sound quality, and a faster H3 audio chip. Some reports suggest potential temperature monitoring capabilities and real-time translation features. The new model will feature design refinements including a slimmer form factor and concealed status LED. The September 9 event establishes groundwork for Apple’s long-term vision, with 2026 expected to bring the company’s first foldable iPhone and 2027 potentially introducing an all-glass design for the iPhone’s 20th anniversary. This three-year transformation roadmap represents Apple’s most ambitious hardware strategy since the original iPhone launch, designed to address mounting competitive pressures and position the company for the next decade. The foldable iPhone is reportedly scheduled for fall 2026 and is rumored to follow a book-style design similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, reportedly featuring a 7.8-inch inner display and 5.5-inch outer screen. The device will reportedly include four cameras, Touch ID instead of Face ID to save internal space, and Apple’s second-generation cellular modem. Analysts predict a starting price around $2,000, positioning it as Apple’s most expensive smartphone to date. The 2027 “iPhone 20” represents an even more radical departure, featuring four-sided curved glass that eliminates bezels entirely and creates what Bloomberg describes as a “mostly glass, curved iPhone without any cutouts.” This design aligns directly with Apple’s Liquid Glass interface introduced in iOS 26, which emphasizes translucency, depth, and spatial-computing elements inspired by the Vision Pro. The curved-glass approach would fulfill former design chief Jony Ive’s long-held vision of creating a device that appears like “a single sheet of glass.” These hardware advances directly support Apple’s spatial computing ambitions, with CEO Tim Cook reportedly “hell bent” on launching true AR glasses before Meta can achieve the same milestone. Cook has reportedly made AR glasses his “top priority,” with one Apple engineer stating “Tim cares about nothing else” from a product-development standpoint. The company’s roadmap reportedly includes lightweight AR glasses expected in 2027, along with multiple Vision Pro iterations through 2028. Apple’s Vision Pro roadmap includes a small power refresh by the end of 2025, followed by a lighter “Vision Air” model in 2027 that may be up to 40% lighter than the current version. The company is also developing smart glasses similar to Meta’s Ray-Bans as an interim solution while perfecting true AR technology. These products collectively aim to achieve Apple’s goal of shipping over 10 million AR/VR products annually by 2027. The strategic timing aligns with Apple’s broader effort to diversify beyond the iPhone while maintaining its premium market position. Features like iOS 26’s 3D photo effects and spatial interface elements serve as stepping stones toward mainstream AR adoption, gradually acclimating users to spatial-computing concepts before introducing dedicated AR hardware. This measured approach allows Apple to build ecosystem readiness while competitors like Meta and Google rush to market with potentially premature products. Apple’s “Awe Dropping” event will livestream on the company’s website, YouTube, and Apple TV, on Tuesday, September 9. Based on past iPhone launch events, where Apple holds the event on a Tuesday, pre-orders typically begin that Friday with general availability launching on week later: In this case, that would mean pre-orders opening on September 12 and at least some of the new iPhones launching on September 19. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: All 7 new products we’re expecting Apple to announce at its ‘Awe Dropping’ September event

Manage your account ... Apple may unveil as many as seven new products at its September 9 “Awe Dropping” event, including the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air that could replace the iPhone Plus line. The company is also expected to introduce health-focused updates across its Apple Watch and AirPods lineups, marking a significant hardware refresh amid ongoing challenges in artificial intelligence competition. Apple’s September 9 “Awe Dropping” event, announced earlier this week, arrives at a critical moment for one of the world’s most valuable companies as it seeks to maintain momentum following strong third-quarter earnings that delivered record revenue of $94 billion. The event, scheduled for 1 p.m. Eastern at Apple’s Cupertino, Calif. headquarters, represents the opening phase of a reported three-year transformation strategy, according to Bloomberg‘s Mark Gurman, that’s designed to reinvent Apple’s hardware ecosystem. The timing carries particular significance as Apple faces mounting challenges in artificial intelligence, where the company has struggled to keep pace with competitors and recently faced an antitrust lawsuit from Elon Musk’s xAI over alleged AI monopolization. Apple’s stock has been hit particularly hard, declining roughly 15-19% so far in 2025, making it the one of the worst performers among the Magnificent Seven tech stocks. The stock lost roughly $75 billion in market value during Apple’s WWDC 2025 keynote in June when the company acknowledged its AI-powered Siri upgrade would be delayed until the following year. Despite these headwinds, Apple’s recent financial performance has shown resilience, with iPhone revenue surging 13.5% to $44.6 billion in the third quarter, partly driven by customers upgrading ahead of potential tariff increases. The September event’s product lineup directly addresses Apple’s strategic priorities by introducing hardware designed to integrate with the company’s Liquid Glass design language: a translucent, depth-focused interface that represents the company’s most significant visual overhaul since iOS 7 in 2013. This design system, inspired by the Vision Pro headset, establishes a unified aesthetic across Apple’s platforms while preparing users for expanded spatial-computing capabilities. The centerpiece of Apple’s September 9 event will reportedly be the ultra-thin iPhone 17 “Air,” which would be the first time an iPhone is bestowed with the moniker that was so popular with Apple’s MacBook line two decades ago. The “Air” model is expected to replace the underperforming iPhone Plus in Apple’s product lineup. The device will reportedly measure approximately 5.5mm at its thinnest point, making it significantly thinner than the iPhone 16’s 7.8mm profile and in all likelihood, given the rumored name, the thinnest iPhone ever made. You can see what it looks like in mock-ups here. The iPhone 17 Air is said to feature a 6.6-inch display supporting 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates, which would be the first time non-Pro iPhones to have this feature that makes your iPhone screen look and feel buttery smooth. The device is rumored to sport a hybrid titanium-aluminum frame and weigh approximately 145 grams, substantially lighter than the iPhone 16 Pro’s 199 grams. However, the ultra-thin design apparently means some compromises. The phone will reportedly only include a single 48-megapixel rear camera and a smaller battery compared to last year’s flagship iPhones. The USB-C port placement is also said to be off-center, and speaker grilles have been simplified to accommodate the slim profile. Color options reportedly include black, white, light gold, and a light blue shade similar to the MacBook Air. Pricing is expected to match the current iPhone Plus at $899. The standard iPhone 17 is rumored to have a better 24-megapixel front-facing camera that doubles the resolution of current models. All iPhone 17 models will reportedly feature ProMotion 120Hz displays, extending this previously Pro-exclusive feature across the entire lineup. The iPhone 17 Pro models will reportedly showcase a new pill-shaped camera bump that’s larger than previous designs, including a 48-megapixel telephoto lens with up to 8x optical zoom; the iPhone 16 Pro is only capable of 5x optical zoom. The Pro models will also transition to primarily aluminum backs instead of glass, improving durability while reducing weight. Color options for the Pro models will reportedly include a pair of new colors hinted at in Apple’s invitations: orange and blue, as well as the more traditional black, white, and silver options. The event’s thermal-inspired logo appears to reference both the new colors and the rumored vapor chamber cooling system designed to prevent overheating during intensive tasks. The Apple Watch Series 11 will apparently emphasize health-monitoring improvements, potentially introducing blood-pressure trend tracking capabilities—though not full systolic and diastolic readings. The feature would detect hypertension patterns and alert users to consult health care professionals. The Series 11 will reportedly come with an updated S11 chip that may be smaller in design to accommodate larger batteries or additional sensors. The watch may also gain 5G RedCap connectivity from MediaTek, according to MacRumors, which would provide faster data speeds than current LTE-only models. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 will reportedly be the first Apple Watch with standalone satellite connectivity, according to Bloomberg‘s Mark Gurman. This feature will enable emergency SOS functionality and potentially text messaging in remote areas without cellular or Wi-Fi coverage. The Ultra 3 is also said to include improved 5G connectivity, and the biggest Apple Watch display to-date, which is said to be brighter and better when viewing it from side angles. And an improved charging coil could enable 80% charging in 30 minutes, according to MacRumors. Apple’s third-generation AirPods Pro will reportedly introduce heart-rate monitoring capabilities, using LED optical sensors that can track your heart rate through blood flow in the ear canal. Beyond health features, the AirPods Pro 3 will include improved Active Noise Cancellation, enhanced sound quality, and a faster H3 audio chip. Some reports suggest potential temperature monitoring capabilities and real-time translation features. The new model will feature design refinements including a slimmer form factor and concealed status LED. The September 9 event establishes groundwork for Apple’s long-term vision, with 2026 expected to bring the company’s first foldable iPhone and 2027 potentially introducing an all-glass design for the iPhone’s 20th anniversary. This three-year transformation roadmap represents Apple’s most ambitious hardware strategy since the original iPhone launch, designed to address mounting competitive pressures and position the company for the next decade. The foldable iPhone is reportedly scheduled for fall 2026 and is rumored to follow a book-style design similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, reportedly featuring a 7.8-inch inner display and 5.5-inch outer screen. The device will reportedly include four cameras, Touch ID instead of Face ID to save internal space, and Apple’s second-generation cellular modem. Analysts predict a starting price around $2,000, positioning it as Apple’s most expensive smartphone to date. The 2027 “iPhone 20” represents an even more radical departure, featuring four-sided curved glass that eliminates bezels entirely and creates what Bloomberg describes as a “mostly glass, curved iPhone without any cutouts.” This design aligns directly with Apple’s Liquid Glass interface introduced in iOS 26, which emphasizes translucency, depth, and spatial-computing elements inspired by the Vision Pro. The curved-glass approach would fulfill former design chief Jony Ive’s long-held vision of creating a device that appears like “a single sheet of glass.” These hardware advances directly support Apple’s spatial computing ambitions, with CEO Tim Cook reportedly “hell bent” on launching true AR glasses before Meta can achieve the same milestone. Cook has reportedly made AR glasses his “top priority,” with one Apple engineer stating “Tim cares about nothing else” from a product-development standpoint. The company’s roadmap reportedly includes lightweight AR glasses expected in 2027, along with multiple Vision Pro iterations through 2028. Apple’s Vision Pro roadmap includes a small power refresh by the end of 2025, followed by a lighter “Vision Air” model in 2027 that may be up to 40% lighter than the current version. The company is also developing smart glasses similar to Meta’s Ray-Bans as an interim solution while perfecting true AR technology. These products collectively aim to achieve Apple’s goal of shipping over 10 million AR/VR products annually by 2027. The strategic timing aligns with Apple’s broader effort to diversify beyond the iPhone while maintaining its premium market position. Features like iOS 26’s 3D photo effects and spatial interface elements serve as stepping stones toward mainstream AR adoption, gradually acclimating users to spatial-computing concepts before introducing dedicated AR hardware. This measured approach allows Apple to build ecosystem readiness while competitors like Meta and Google rush to market with potentially premature products. Apple’s “Awe Dropping” event will livestream on the company’s website, YouTube, and Apple TV, on Tuesday, September 9. Based on past iPhone launch events, where Apple holds the event on a Tuesday, pre-orders typically begin that Friday with general availability launching on week later: In this case, that would mean pre-orders opening on September 12 and at least some of the new iPhones launching on September 19.

Title: Best Altcoins to Buy Now as Ripple CEO Predicts $25T Crypto Market by 2030

The total crypto market cap has grown by nearly 400% in the last three years, from $727B in October 2022 to a staggering $3.72T at the time of writing. That kind of growth is unheard of in traditional stock market indices. But wait until you hear what Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse thinks is next for crypto. Keep reading to discover why Ripple’s boss predicts such explosive growth for crypto, his insights on Ripple’s own token, $XRP, and how you can position yourself for this potentially outrageous rally by loading up on the best altcoins to buy now. Garlinghouse cited the vulnerability of traditional fiat currencies as the biggest reason behind his extremely bullish crypto outlook. He explained that macroeconomic pressures on fiat are all but certain to intensify in the coming years, which could push traditional currencies toward devaluation and long-term instability. Amid such uncertainty, digital assets provide more than just hope; they’re built specifically to plug the holes in the global financial system, offering transparency, efficiency, and inflation-resistant store of value that fiat currencies simply can’t match. As one of the biggest cryptocurrencies targeting the cross-border payments market, many believe $XRP could become one of the biggest success stories in the next few years. All in all, with prominent industry voices bullish on crypto’s long-term growth, everyday investors will fare extremely well if they simply exercise patience during slightly deeper consolidations like the one we’re seeing now. In fact, now’s the perfect time to beef up your crypto portfolio with low-cap, high-upside tokens that are well-positioned to ride the upcoming boom. Snorter Token ($SNORT) is one of the best cryptos to buy now for those looking to ride the explosive growth of the meme coin market. While altcoins continue to dominate crypto discussions, the meme coin segment alone has grown by more than 70% in the past year, proving there’s so much more juice in it than many realize. $SNORT powers the Snorter Bot, a new Telegram-native trading bot designed to level the playing field between institutional players and everyday meme coin traders. How? By allowing retail investors to set buy/sell orders in advance, and then automatically executing them the moment liquidity kicks in. As a result, you’ll finally get the chance to participate in those early meme coin pumps, where life-changing gains are usually made. Security is another standout. Snorter offers protection against a wide range of on-chain threats, including front-running, rug pulls, honeypots, and even advanced sandwich attacks. By buying $SNORT, you’re positioning yourself to ride the adoption of Snorter Bot while unlocking a slew of exclusive benefits along the way: Currently in presale, $SNORT has already pulled in over $3.55M from early investors, with each token available at just $0.1027. Visit Snorter Token’s official website for more information. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) might not have a shiny whitepaper or game-changing technology, but its absurd mission to overthrow Dogecoin as the best meme coin on the planet has already gathered plenty of hype and community support. The project has raised over $1.66M in early investor funding, proving that degen investors are hungry for a wild, rage-fueled meme coin. What’s Maxi Doge, really? Believe it or not, Maxi is Dogecoin’s distant cousin. But the two are anything but close. Dogecoin’s popularity left Maxi in the shadows growing up, as the elder, more ‘wholesome’ Shiba Inu hogged all the limelight at family gatherings. That’s when Maxi found solace in the gym and in front of the charts, where he built big muscles and chased even bigger gains. Now, backed by a fierce community of $MAXI holders who all subscribe to his mantra of ‘never skip leg day, never skip a pump’, the dawg is ready to take the market by storm. Interested? Join the tribe by buying $MAXI at just $0.0002545 apiece. Hurry up, though, because the price will increase in just a few hours. Check out Maxi Doge’s official website for more information. Ethereum ($ETH) has undoubtedly been the talk of the crypto town over the past two weeks, with whales pouring big money into the ‘digital silver.’ For instance, BlackRock recently snapped up more than $314M worth of Ethereum, while Goldman Sachs and Jane Street grabbed a combined 192.5K $ETH. More notably, Thomas Lee, a significant voice in the crypto space, explained that while Wall Street once dismissed Ethereum for being slower than Solana or Sui, institutions are now betting big on it because of its ability to deliver 100% uptime – something non-negotiable for big-money players. ‘If ETH stays above $4,800, we could see a really big cycle,’ Lee added. That prediction looks even stronger when you consider that a massive $4.65B worth of shorts would be liquidated if Ethereum retests its all-time high. Although $ETH has been red all week, the drop isn’t as bad as it looks – because its weekly candle remains within last week’s range. According to the technical playbook, this forms a classic ‘inside candle’ pattern, and a breakout here could trigger an explosive rally. With Ripple’s CEO projecting a nearly tenfold increase in crypto’s valuation by 2030, the stage is set for promising altcoins like $SNORT, $MAXI, and $ETH to shine in the upcoming bull run. That said, kindly bear in mind that crypto investments are highly risky. Also, none of the above is financial advice, and you must always do your own research before investing.

Title: The wine business is in crisis but these whites might be the thing to save it

The wine business is going through something of a crisis at the moment as worldwide consumption maintains a steady downward curve. According to the OIV (International Organisation of Vine and Wine), sales in 2024 are estimated to have been 214.2 million hectolitres – a decrease of 3.3 per cent from 2023. This would be the lowest volume recorded since 1961. According to EU figures, France alone is drinking 65 per cent less than in the 1960s. However, the decrease has been mainly in red wines. Sales of white, rosé and sparkling wines have been steady, even increasing slightly in some years. There is some evidence that growers in traditionally red wine regions such as Bordeaux are ripping up their red vines and planting white instead. Millennials and Gen Z are the key groups here. Instead of sitting down to long dinners accompanied by red wine, they prefer to drink wine by itself or with plates and side dishes. They are aware of the dangers of alcohol, and drink selectively, on special occasions. They prefer organic or sustainable drinks and want to know about the producer. Social media influences drinking patterns and choices. In general the two groups prefer lighter white, or rosé wines with good acidity, plenty of aromas and a bit of texture; wines that will go with the variety of flavours that comes with a mix of small plates and side dishes. They enjoy colourful labels and low-intervention wines. They are also drinking more cocktails, craft beers, low- or no-alcohol drinks, and enjoy ready-to-drink (RTD) and canned cocktails. This week, I present four wines that should appeal to millennials, Gen Z and the rest of us too. This sustainably produced wine is fresh with a vibrant acidity and succulent mouthwatering peach fruits. To drink with fish, creamy chicken and pork dishes. Excellent value for money. Dunnes A light, aromatic and refreshing sauvignon with some nice rich exotic fruits on the palate. Perfect for sipping or with mixed snacks. Wicklow Wine Co, Wicklow; Blackrock Cellar, Blackrock, Co Dublin; Red Island, Skerries, Co Dublin; Morton’s, Dublin 6 Low in alcohol.

Title: High prices expected for New York sapphires

Provenance and rarity are two of the elements that add value to antique jewellery. And, in the forthcoming jewellery auction at Adam’s on September 9th, these will come together, with the sale of two Kashmir sapphires, each set in early 20th-century brooches. Readers of this column may remember how, in May, a rare Kashmir sapphire was sold under the hammer at Adam’s for €550,00 (€660,000 including all fees). At that time the sale made front-page news as it was the highest price paid in Ireland for a gem of its kind. “It was a record-breaking price for a piece of jewellery sold at auction in Ireland and one of the highest prices per carat fetched at auction worldwide in recent years,” says Claire-Laurence Mestrallet, head of jewellery and watches at Adam’s. Kashmir sapphires from the rugged Zanskar range of the Himalayan mountains in Kashmir in northwest India are the rarest and most sought after sapphires in the world. This is partly because the mine in which they originated was completely depleted of the gemstones less than a decade after their discovery in 1881. The rarity of these two brooches now for sale – one with a cushion-shaped sapphire with a double frame of old European single-cut diamonds (estimate €150,000-€250,000), and the other an oval sapphire within a frame of old-cut diamonds (€200,000-€300,000), has been confirmed by two prominent laboratories in Switzerland – the Swiss Gemmological Institute and the Gübelin laboratory. However, it is their provenance that is arguably more interesting. The brooches were gifted to May Emily Sands by her New Yorker parents, Benjamin Aymar Sands and Amy Kirby Akin, upon her marriage to Hugh Melville Howard in September 1908. Howard was the younger son of Fanny Catherine Wingfield and her husband, the sixth earl of Wicklow, whose ancestral seat was Shelton Abbey in Co Wicklow. “The marriage of the daughter of Benjamin Aymar Sands, himself the son of a well-known New York banker, brought together a bond of American society and European aristocracy,” says Mestrallet. The Sands family was one of the original settlers on Long Island and gave their name to Sands Point. The opulence of old-money families and the scenic coastal views in the area are believed to have inspired the fictional East Egg location in F Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby. If aristocratic lineage, or indeed privileged New Yorkers at the turn of the 20th century, isn’t your thing, how the brooches have ended up in a Dublin auction might be. “Hugh died of pneumonia at a young age and May developed psychological problems and was institutionalised. Their two children, Katherine and Cecil, went to live with their uncle, the seventh earl of Wicklow, at Shelton Abbey,” says Mestrallet. And while Cecil Howard returned to live in Manhattan, Katharine Howard remained in Ireland and bought Ounavarra House and farm in Co Wexford. Throughout her life, she contributing to many worthy causes, and the Katharine Howard Foundation was later set up in her memory. She was godmother to the current owner of the brooches, whose name Mestrallet won’t reveal. Meanwhile, Adam’s Blackrock is also hosting an online jewellery auction, which ends on Wednesday, September 10th. An 18-carat gold bracelet made by the Italian brand Marco Bicego is among the exquisite pieces. It is composed of no less than 20 delicate fine-link strands of 18-carat gold, each of which is set with “pebbles” of gold (€3,000-€4,000). And, Morgan O’Driscoll is hosting his first online jewellery auction, which ends on Monday, September 8th. The sale- which have been curated by gemmologist, Colin Weldon, has lots of luxurious earrings, necklaces, bracelets, including the “tutti-frutti’ gem-set bracelet (€40,000-€60,000), with a mix of diamonds and carved and smooth-domed gemstones. The sale also includes a 17th-century enamel diamond and emerald stomacher pendant (€30,000-€40,000). A stomacher is a piece of jewellery that was worn at the centre of the panel in the bodice of a dress. In the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, stomachers became large eye-catching pieces of jewellery worn for formal occasions. Finally, provenance and rarity also come to the fore in the book sale of the entire library of the late Tommy Smith at Purcell’s Auctioneers in Birr, Co Offaly, on September 3rd and 4th. Smith co-owned Grogan’s pub on South William Street, Dublin, very popular with artists and writers. “Tommy befriended many of Ireland’s leading writers and poets and their publications – many of which are signed and dedicated to Tommy – make up a very large proportion of this sale,” says Conor Purcell. He points to Patrick Kavanagh’s Tarry Flynn (Devin Adair, New York, 1949) as one of the most intriguing items for sale, as it is the actual copy used in the infamous libel court case involving Patrick Kavanagh in the 1950s. “During cross-examination, Kavanagh denied that he and Brendan were friends – upon which a copy of Kavanagh’s book Tarry Flynn was given in evidence, with attention drawn to his inside cover inscription: “For Brendan, poet and painter, on the day he decorated my flat, Sunday, 12th, 1950” explains Purcell. The book has an estimate of €3,000-€6,000. adams.ie adamsblackrock.com morganodriscoll.com purcellauctioneers.ie Estimate €500-€1,000 Hammer price €750 Auction house Adam’s Estimate €1,500-€2,500 Hammer price €3,200 Auction house Adam’s Estimate $30,000-$40,000 Hammer price $40,000 (€34,120) Auction house Sotheby’s New York Estimate $2,400-$4,000 Hammer price $2,500 (€3,500) Auction house Sotheby’s New York © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

AT THE END of June, the United Nations released a new report which denounced 48 companies it claimed had profited from “the Israeli economy of illegal occupation, apartheid, and [...] genocide” in Palestine. The report by the UN’s Special Rapporteur for the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Francesca Albanese, claimed that “far too many” companies had profited from the decades-long conflict. Albanese called for these companies to end their complicity in “human rights violations and international crimes” or “be held to account”. Earlier this week, Norway’s wealth fund made headlines when it divested from Caterpillar – one of the companies on the list – over the use of its machinery by Israel to demolish Palestinian properties in the West Bank and Gaza. But the country is not the only one whose sovereign wealth fund invests in companies that are named on the UN list. Ireland’s fund, the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, maintains direct investments in exactly a quarter of the 48 companies, which are valued at almost €97 million. Who are these companies and why are they named on the list? ISIF investment value: €440,000 Airbnb is one of two accommodation websites listed in the report, and was named for listing properties and hotel rooms in illegal Israeli settlements. The Journal Investigates previously searched Airbnb and found a number of listings for properties that are based in settlements in the West Bank, occupied East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. These listings – and Airbnb’s attempts to stop featuring them – have prompted a number of legal actions against the company. In the US and Israel, Airbnb has found itself at the centre of a legal challenge over its decision to remove around 200 listings for accommodation in West Bank settlements that it said “are at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians”. It settled four of those legal challenges and reversed its decision to remove the properties the following year. The company said at the time that it would instead donate all profits from its listings in the occupied West Bank to “non-profit organisations dedicated to humanitarian aid that serve people in different parts of the world”. The Journal contacted Airbnb Inc for comment, but no response was received by the time of publication. Recent statements given by the company to other news outlets have pointed to its donation of profits from host activity in the West Bank to an international charity. ISIF investment value: €21.54 million Alphabet Inc, better known as the parent company of Google, was named in the report as one of four tech giants which are deemed central to “Israel’s surveillance apparatus and the ongoing Gaza destruction”. It claims that Alphabet also grants Israel “virtually government-wide access” to its cloud and artificial intelligence technologies, which allow Israel to enhance its processing of data and surveillance capacities against Palestinians. The report also outlines how the company was awarded a $1.2 billion (€1.03 billion) contract in 2021, alongside Amazon, to provide cloud tech infrastructure to Israel’s government and military. Google workers openly protested against the contract last year, because they demanded to know whether their labour was being used as part of Israel’s war on Gaza. The Journal contacted Alphabet for comment, but no response was received by the time of publication. In previous statements to other outlets, Alphabet has said that its contract for Project Nimbus “is not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services”. It also said that the company works with governments around the world. ISIF investment value: €790,000 German insurance company Allianz was named in the report for investing in shares and bonds which Albanese claimed are “implicated in the occupation and genocide”. The report claims that Allianz holds at least $7.3 billion (€6.3 billion) in these investments, which it says are made partly as policyholder claims and regulatory requirements, but whose primary focus is to generate returns. The report also claims that Allianz’s policies underwrite risks taken by other companies which operate in illegal settlements in occupied Palestinian territories. As well as this, the report names Allianz’s asset management subsidiary Pimco as one of 400 investors to have purchased Israeli state bonds that have financed the country’s war in Gaza. Earlier this month, 800 current and former GAA players signed an open letter calling on the organisation to end its partnership with Allianz over its link to the war in Gaza. A spokesperson for Allianz Ireland was contacted by The Journal and the company declined to comment. ISIF investment value: €23.53 million Like Alphabet, Amazon is named in the report as one of four tech giants that the UN special rapporteur deems central to Israel’s surveillance apparatus and the destruction of Gaza. It also holds part of the $1.2 billion (€1.03 billion) Project Nimbus contract to provide advanced AI and machine-learning capabilities to the Israeli government. And it was also among the companies that provided the Israeli internal military with necessary cloud and AI tech after the IDF’s cloud system overloaded in October 2023. The company’s e-commerce platform Amazon.com is also named for operating directly in illegal Israeli settlements, which the report says helps to both sustain the economy of the settlements and to enable their expansion. The Journal contacted Amazon for comment, but no response was received by the time of publication. The company does not appear to have addressed its appearance in the UN report to date. ISIF investment value: €2.24 million Unlike other companies on the list, which tend to operate in Israel or illegal settlements or have contracts with Israel’s defence industry, asset management firm BlackRock is named as one of several companies deemed to finance “Israeli occupation and genocide”. The New York based firm is specifically named in the report because the UN says it is “among the largest investors in arms companies pivotal to the genocidal arsenal of Israel”. It is considered to have done this by purchasing bonds that are deemed to have “a critical role in funding the ongoing assault on Gaza” and for holding shares in companies that are alleged to be “implicated in the occupation and genocide” in Gaza. This includes significant investments in a number of the companies named in the report (which also feature in this article), such as Palantir, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Alphabet, IBM, Lockheed Martin and Caterpillar. A spokesperson for BlackRock was contacted by The Journal, but the company declined to comment. ISIF investment value: €1.04 million Advertisement Booking Holdings, the company behind the Dutch-based accommodation company Booking.com, was named in the report for listing properties and hotel rooms in illegal Israeli settlements. It noted that Booking.com more than doubled its listings in West Bank settlements from 26 in 2018 to 70 by May 2023. The Journal Investigates previously browsed Booking.com and was able to find hundreds of listings for hotels and guesthouses based in settlements in the West Bank, the Golan Heights and occupied East Jerusalem. The company announced in September 2022 that it would start adding safety guidance to any listings in the occupied West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem, including guidance that the reservations are “occupied”. It subsequently backtracked on this policy the following month after pressure from the Israeli government, and instead opted to use the term “conflict-affected” in its warnings. The Journal contacted Booking.com for comment for this article, but received no response by the time of publication. The company told this publication for a previous article about its activities in the occupied territories that it believed it was “not our place to decide where someone can or cannot travel”. ISIF investment value: €260,000 Caterpillar, the world’s largest manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, features throughout the report for providing machinery and equipment used by Israel to demolish Palestinian homes and infrastructure. The company is well-known for producing machines like excavators and bulldozers, as well as industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives. The UN report claims that Caterpillar’s products have been used to carry out “mass demolitions” of homes, mosques and other infrastructure, as well as the raiding of hospitals, and burying wounded Palestinians alive. The report further claims that Israel has evolved Caterpillar’s D9 bulldozer into a piece of “automated, remote-commanded core weaponry” of its military. It says this has been deployed “in almost every military activity since 2000″, such as clearing incursion lines, ‘neutralising’ Palestinian territory and killing Palestinians. The company was contacted for comment by The Journal, but no response was received by the time of publication. Caterpillar has not yet commented on its inclusion in the report, or the decision of Norway’s wealth fund to divest from the company over the use of its bulldozers in the destruction of Palestinian homes. ISIF investment value: €1.38 million The Japanese Fanuc Corporation is one of the lesser-known names on the list, in which the ISIF maintains a seven-figure investment. The corporation is a group of companies that provide automation products and services like robotics and wireless computer systems. It is mentioned just once in the report in a section about companies which facilitate the arms trade in Israel – though Fanuc appears to do this indirectly. The UN claims that the corporation provides robotic machinery for the weapons production lines of manufacturers such as Israel Aerospace Industries, Elbit Systems and Lockheed Martin, all of which are named as being pivotal to Israel’s violence against Palestinians in Gaza and in illegal settlements. In response to the report, a spokesperson for Fanuc told The Journal that there are “no records of sales or services for military use being conducted by our company or our European subsidiaries to Israeli companies”. It added that in the event that Fanuc sells products or services destined for Israel, the company conducts necessary screening in accordance with Japanese legislation. “If it is confirmed that the intended use is of a military nature, we do not proceed with the sale,” the company’s spokesperson said. ISIF investment value: €700,000 American tech multinational Hewlett Packard is named in the report for previous, rather than current activities. According to the UN special rapporteur, one part of the company known as Hewlett Packard Enterprises maintained a database for Israel’s Population and Immigration Authority until 2019. The report claimed that this enabled the “collection, storage and governmental use of biometric data on Palestinians” and supported “the discriminatory permit regime of Israel”. A spokesperson for Hewlett Packard Enterprise told The Journal that the company is “strongly committed to socially responsible business practices” and always has been. The company’s statement continued that it works in markets that are consistent with its “values, standards, and global human rights policy”, adding that it was comfortable that its business with the state of Israel is “in alignment with our human rights policy”. ISIF investment value: €5.94 million Technology company IBM is named in the report for a number of activities, including taking over maintainence of the database for Israel’s Population and Immigration Authority from Hewlett Packard Enterprises. The UN alleges that IBM has collaborated with science and technology faculties in ways that contribute to the production of tools for surveillance, crowd control, urban warfare, facial recognition and targeted killing that are “effectively tested on Palestinians”. IBM was contacted for comment on these allegations, but no response was received by the time of publication. ISIF investment value: €38.01 million Another of the big tech platforms named in the report, Microsoft is named as basing its largest centre outside of the United States in Israel, where it has operated since 1991. The report says that the company’s technologies are “embedded” throughout Israel’s state infrastructure and in illegal settlements, including in the prison service, police force, universities and schools. As with Amazon and Alphabet, the report further alleges that Microsoft has given “virtually government-wide access” to its cloud and AI technologies in ways that allow Israel to enhance data processing and surveillance. It also names Microsoft’s Azure platform as stepping in when the IDF’s cloud system overloaded in October 2023. The Journal contacted Microsoft for comment,and was directed to a blog post from May, in which the company said it took “seriously” concerns that its AI technologies were being used by Israeli military to target civilians in Gaza, though it said it had found “no evidence” that this was happening. The company also said that it would formally review the use of Microsoft Azure by a unit of the IDF, after The Guardian reported the system was used to store data files of phone calls obtained through surveillance of civilians in Gaza and the West Bank. ISIF investment value: €950,000 Data mining company Palantir, which made headlines here last year after it emerged Social Democrats TD Eoin Hayes held shares in the company, features throughout the UN report. The company has been widely criticised for its involvement with Israel and the conflict in Gaza since the war began. The UN says there are “reasonable grounds to believe” the company has provided Israel with its AI programme and other technologies to enhance the IDF’s decision-making capabilities in real-time. It also points to a strategic partnership that the company has with Israel and how it’s CEO responded to accusations that Palantir had been involved in the killing of Palestinians in Gaza by saying “mostly terrorists, that’s true”. The company did not respond to a request for comment from The Journal. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: S&P 500 Gains & Losses Today: Dell, Ulta Shares Drop; Autodesk Stock Soars

Major U.S. equities indexes retreated from recent highs as investors digested fresh economic data ahead of the three-day Labor Day weekend. Friday's move lower came after the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report—a gauge of inflation closely monitored by the Federal Reserve—showed a month-over-month uptick in "core" PCE inflation in July. The S&P 500 and the Dow declined 0.2% and 0.6%, after closing Thursday at record levels. Underperformance from the technology sector weighed on the Nasdaq, which fell 1.2%. Read Investopedia's full daily markets coverage here. Shares of Dell Technologies (DELL) tumbled 8.9%, suffering the heaviest daily loss of any stock in the S&P 500. Although strong demand related to artificial intelligence helped the maker of personal computers, servers, and other IT hardware topped second-quarter sales and profit estimates, Dell's guidance for third-quarter earnings per share came in below consensus estimates. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) shares dropped 7.1%. The decline reversed solid gains posted by the stock in the prior session. The cosmetics retailer late yesterday posted stronger-than-expected sales and profits for the second quarter and boosted its full-year revenue guidance. Ulta faces continued uncertainty related to potential tariff impacts. Although many stocks with exposure to AI initially gained ground in the wake of the latest earnings report from AI semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA), the rally lost steam on Friday. Shares of Oracle (ORCL), the enterprise software firm that has recently announced major investments in AI and cloud infrastructure, slipped 5.9%, while shares of AI-focused server manufacturer Super Micro Computer (SMCI) ended 5.5% lower. Autodesk (ADSK) shares bucked the downward pressure on the broader tech sector and software industries, jumping 9.1% to log the S&P 500's top performance. The engineering and design software provider topped second-quarter sales and adjusted profit estimates and lifted its full-year forecasts. Demand for its design software for AI data centers helped underpin the performance. Shares of Cooper Cos. (COO), a medical device maker focused vision care and surgical products, advanced 4.4%. With the move higher heading into the holiday weekend, Cooper stock clawed back a portion of the heavy losses posted Thursday after the company missed quarterly revenue estimates and lowered its full-year sales forecast. J.M. Smucker (SJM) stock also staged a recovery on Friday from a post-earnings swoon suffered earlier in the week, adding 3.6%. The maker of its namesake fruit spreads as well as the Hostess snack cake brand reported a loss for its fiscal first quarter and noted that tariffs were having a negative impact on its coffee business. On its earnings call, the company said it anticipates additional price hikes as it navigates tariff-related cost pressure.

Title: BlackRock Ethereum ETF captures second-highest weekly inflows among over 4,400 ETFs

Before this surge, Ethereum ETFs had recorded negative $400 million year-to-date flows, amounting to approximately $2.5 billion. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum (ETH) Trust ETF (ETHA) recorded $1.244 billion in weekly inflows from Aug. 18-22, ranking second among all 4,400-plus ETFs tracked during the period. NovaDius Wealth president Nate Geraci noted in an Aug. 29 post via X that only Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF outperformed ETHA’s with $1.711 billion in weekly flows. He also highlighted the significance of ETHA appearing among “heavy hitters” in weekly inflow rankings, demonstrating institutional appetite for Ethereum exposure. Further, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart reported on Aug. 29 that Ethereum ETFs have accumulated nearly $10 billion in inflows since July, marking substantial momentum for the asset class. Before this surge, Ethereum ETFs had recorded negative $400 million year-to-date flows, amounting to approximately $2.5 billion, according to Farside Investors’ data. Market conditions indicate that capital is rotating from Bitcoin to Ethereum throughout August. While Bitcoin ETFs registered $800 million in outflows through Aug. 28, Ethereum ETFs accumulated $4 billion in inflows during the same period, per Farside Investors tracking. The inflow disparity reflects evolving institutional preferences as investors diversify cryptocurrency allocations beyond Bitcoin. Additionally, retail participation accelerated in tandem with institutional interest. DeFiLlama data shows that Ethereum achieved a monthly spot trading volume record of $135 billion as of Aug. 29, surpassing the previous high of $117.6 billion from May 2021. The institutional adoption is not limited to exposure through ETFs, as corporate Ethereum adoption accelerated significantly during the summer months. Strategic ETH Reserve data reveals corporate Ethereum treasuries increased from $2.3 billion to $19.1 billion between June 1 and Aug. 29. In token terms, corporate reserves expanded from 916,268 ETH to 4,438,352 ETH over the same period, representing approximately 3.7% of total ETH supply. The treasury accumulation pattern, combined with the increasing number of institutions adding ETH, suggests institutional recognition of Ethereum as a treasury asset. ETHA’s performance demonstrates the integration of Ethereum into mainstream investment flows, with crypto products competing directly against established equity and bond ETFs for investor capital.

Title: Nvidia, Broadcom Lead Chip Stocks Lower Amid China Concerns to End a Strong Month

The chips are down to close out August. A range of chip stocks slid Friday, weighing on the major U.S. equities indexes in the last trading session of the month. China concerns weighed on the sector, but that wasn't the only factor that pulled shares lower. The tech sector led losses on the S&P 500 Friday, with Nvidia (NVDA) among its biggest decliners. The giant's shares lost over 3% amid uncertainty about its China sales after it reported quarterly results Wednesday. Broadcom (AVGO), which reports next week, saw its stock fall close to 4%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and other chip stocks were also lower, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) down roughly 3%. Marvell Technology (MRVL) shares plunged the most of any stock in the sector index, losing nearly a fifth of its value after the firm posted an outlook that missed analysts' estimates, with concerns about U.S. restrictions on chip sales to China and Marvell's large exposure to the country adding to worries. The Trump administration said Friday that it’s eliminating a Biden-era loophole allowing Samsung and SK Hynix subsidiaries in China to import American chipmaking equipment and software without a license, which could make it more difficult for the companies to upgrade plants and affect supply chains for other chip firms that rely on their manufacturing services. The rule is set to take effect in January. “The Trump Administration is committed to closing export control loopholes—particularly those that put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage. Today’s decision is an important step towards fulfilling this commitment," Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Kessler said. Samsung and SK Hynix, which both make chips for Nvidia and Broadcom, did not immediately respond to Investopedia's request for comment. Intel (INTC), which completed the sale of its facility in Dalian, China to SK Hynix earlier this year, was also named in Friday’s notice. Meanwhile, Alibaba Group's (BABA) cloud computing unit reportedly developed a new chip more advanced than its legacy products that could help fill the void left by Nvidia's H20 AI chip that has yet to resume sales in China. Shares of Alibaba, also bolstered by its latest quarterly results, surged 13%. August has been a strong month for most chipmakers, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index set to post gains for August on optimism about AI-driven growth, which helped buoy the S&P 500 to a record high yesterday.

The giant's shares lost over 3% amid uncertainty about its China sales after it reported quarterly results Wednesday. Broadcom (AVGO), which reports next week, saw its stock fall close to 4%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and other chip stocks were also lower, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) down roughly 3%. Marvell Technology (MRVL) shares plunged the most of any stock in the sector index, losing nearly a fifth of its value after the firm posted an outlook that missed analysts' estimates, with concerns about U.S. restrictions on chip sales to China and Marvell's large exposure to the country adding to worries. The Trump administration said Friday that it’s eliminating a Biden-era loophole allowing Samsung and SK Hynix subsidiaries in China to import American chipmaking equipment and software without a license, which could make it more difficult for the companies to upgrade plants and affect supply chains for other chip firms that rely on their manufacturing services. The rule is set to take effect in January. “The Trump Administration is committed to closing export control loopholes—particularly those that put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage. Today’s decision is an important step towards fulfilling this commitment," Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Kessler said. Samsung and SK Hynix, which both make chips for Nvidia and Broadcom, did not immediately respond to Investopedia's request for comment. Intel (INTC), which completed the sale of its facility in Dalian, China to SK Hynix earlier this year, was also named in Friday’s notice. Meanwhile, Alibaba Group's (BABA) cloud computing unit reportedly developed a new chip more advanced than its legacy products that could help fill the void left by Nvidia's H20 AI chip that has yet to resume sales in China. Shares of Alibaba, also bolstered by its latest quarterly results, surged 13%. August has been a strong month for most chipmakers, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index set to post gains for August on optimism about AI-driven growth, which helped buoy the S&P 500 to a record high yesterday.

BitMine Immersion Technologies saw its stock sink nearly 8% this week, yet that didn’t stop Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest from pouring another $15.6 million into the company. The latest move comes during a period of heightened volatility in both equities and crypto markets. According to ARK’s trading disclosures on August 27, the firm bought 339,113 BitMine shares spread across three ETFs. The ARK Innovation ETF acquired 227,569 shares valued at a little over $10 million, while the Next Generation Internet ETF added 70,991 shares worth $3.27 million. The Fintech Innovation ETF purchased another 40,553 shares for $1.87 million. Despite this fresh round of buying, BitMine shares ended the day at $46 before sliding 7.80% in extended trading. Cathie Wood and Ark Invest bought 339,113 shares of Tom Lee’s $BMNR today pic.twitter.com/G9SQY02rDg — Tom Lee Tracker (@TomLeeTracker) August 28, 2025 BitMine’s pivot from Bitcoin mining to an Ethereum-focused treasury earlier this summer has transformed the firm into a major corporate player in crypto. Its balance sheet now holds 1,714,000 ETH, worth about $8.20 billion, alongside 192 Bitcoin and $562 million in cash. That makes BitMine the world’s largest corporate holder of Ethereum. Billionaire investor Peter Thiel has also taken a 9% stake, adding more weight to the firm’s rapid rise. According to latest data, the company’s strategy has fueled sharp price movements in its stock. After surging more than 3,000% to a record high of $135 in early July, shares remain up more than 400% year-to-date despite recent pullbacks. Reports have disclosed that BitMine dramatically expanded its fundraising plans. On August 12, the company filed to boost its at-the-market equity offering from $2 billion to $24.5 billion, a move led by Cantor Fitzgerald and ThinkEquity. Observers say the new funds will give BitMine more firepower to build its Ethereum position. Analysts projected strong gains for Ethereum, predicting $5,500 in the near term and as high as $12,000 by year-end. If those targets materialize and BitMine pushes toward its 5% supply goal, the company could one day rival Michael Saylor’s Strategy in scale. Social media reaction has been quick to frame BitMine as Ethereum’s version of Strategy — a corporate vehicle for institutional exposure to the asset. ARK’s growing position, surpassing $200 million this summer, only strengthens that concept. Yet the risks are just as visible. BitMine’s share price swings highlight how concentrated bets can move violently, even with billions of dollars on the balance sheet.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Governance, Risk & Compliance: 90-Day Plan To Get Digital Assets Ready
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyaevans/2025/08/29/governance-risk--compliance-90-day-plan-to-get-digital-assets-ready/
Time Published: 2025-08-29T19:38:29Z

ByTonya M. Evans, Contributor. The regulatory landscape for digital assets shifted dramatically in July 2025. President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, creating the first federal stablecoin framework. The House passed two additional landmark bills—the CLARITY Act and Anti-CBDC Act—that now head to an uncertain Senate. Meanwhile, 53 banking associations launched coordinated opposition to what they see as competitive threats to traditional deposits. For Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) professionals, this isn't about "crypto" anymore. It's about preparing compliance programs for a fundamental shift in how money and financial services operate. The question isn't whether digital assets will require enterprise-level risk management, it's whether your organization will be ready when full implementation begins in 2027. While crypto advocates celebrated legislative victories, a powerful counterforce mobilized. On August 13, 2025, the American Banking Association and 52 state banking groups sent joint letters to Senate leadership demanding amendments to the GENIUS Act. Their concerns reveal the competitive dynamics GRC professionals must now navigate: Deposit Flight Risk: Treasury estimates suggest stablecoins could drain up to $6.6 trillion from traditional bank deposits. This isn't speculation—it's why your organization's digital asset policies now intersect with liquidity management and treasury operations. Regulatory Arbitrage: Uninsured stablecoin issuers may operate across state lines without the regulatory requirements that apply to federally insured banks. GRC professionals must assess whether their institutions face competitive disadvantages or compliance gaps. Interest Payment Workarounds: Banking groups warn that while the GENIUS Act prohibits direct interest payments on stablecoins, issuers could partner with exchanges to offer indirect yield programs. This creates gray areas that compliance teams must monitor. The crypto industry's $135 million in 2024 election spending focused on fighting regulatory overreach. They underestimated the entrenched political influence of traditional banking, which now represents an organized opposition with deeper institutional relationships and systemic risk arguments that resonate with policymakers. Even the signed GENIUS Act is essentially a legislative architectural blueprint waiting for operational details from the executive branch of the United States government. Federal agencies have until July 18, 2026, to issue implementing regulations, with full compliance required by January 18, 2027. What we still don't know about the GENIUS Act: For the CLARITY and Anti-CBDC Acts, we’re even earlier in the process. If they pass the Senate with amendments, expect another 12-24 month rulemaking period. Even if all goes as planned by the administration, it will be 2027-2028 before any comprehensive digital asset regulatory framework is fully operational. Immediate Risk Assessment Policy Framework Updates Technology and Vendor Assessment Training Program Development Pilot Program Launch Strategic Positioning Regulatory Classification Systems Understanding how assets move between SEC (securities) and CFTC (commodities) oversight under the proposed CLARITY Act framework. This determines examination procedures, registration requirements, and compliance obligations. Reserve and Custody Requirements The GENIUS Act requires 100% reserve backing with liquid assets, but implementing regulations will determine operational details like custody standards, acceptable reserve assets, and reporting requirements. AML/BSA Implications Digital asset transactions create unique challenges for transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and customer identification programs. Blockchain analytics provide new investigative tools but require specialized expertise. Examination Priorities Federal banking agencies will develop examination procedures for institutions with digital asset activities. Early indicators suggest focus on risk management, AML compliance, and consumer protection. Preparing for Regulatory Evolution The current legislative framework provides general outlines, but practical compliance requirements will emerge through: GRC professionals who begin building competency now will have competitive advantages when full implementation begins. Those waiting for "final" rules risk being unprepared for rapidly evolving compliance obligations. Major banks already recognize this shift. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and BlackRock have launched digital asset services while their industry associations lobby against crypto-friendly regulations. This reflects institutional recognition that digital assets represent business opportunities despite competitive concerns about traditional banking models. For GRC professionals, this creates a two-front challenge: preparing for digital asset compliance obligations while navigating industry opposition that may influence final regulatory implementation. Your Competitive Advantage Opportunity Digital asset regulation is moving from regulatory gray areas toward comprehensive federal oversight. The transformation has begun, but it's far from complete. GRC professionals who invest in understanding the emerging regulatory architecture will provide valuable guidance during this transition. Ensure your compliance program will be ready to provide competent, confident guidance when clients need it most. Begin building foundational competency now. Monitor legislative developments closely. Prepare for implementation timelines measured in years, not months. And remember that even when regulations are finalized, the digital asset landscape will continue evolving as markets, technology, and policy priorities change. The smartest GRC professionals are positioning themselves as knowledgeable advisors in the integrated traditional-digital finance economy that's emerging. Your 90-day action plan starts now.

Title: Ripple Swell 2025 Is Almost Here: Here’s What To Expect From The Event

Ripple Swell 2025 is fast approaching, even as members of the XRP community look forward to the bullish announcements that could come at the conference. The crypto firm also unveiled featured speakers at the event, including its executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen. Ripple has announced that the Swell event will take place in New York from November 4 to 5. Featured speakers include Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Co-founder Chris Larsen, President Monica Long, Nasdaq’s Chair Adena Friedman, and renowned chef José Andrés. Executives from BlackRock, Fidelity, Bitwise, Citi, CME Group, and Franklin Templeton are also set to speak at the event. The Ripple Swell event will cover several topics that touch on the firm’s customers, team members, and industry thought leaders, as well as how financial institutions and businesses are leveraging cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. These topics will include tokenization, payments, regional regulatory process, and crypto financial services. These are all topics that Ripple, as a firm, is conversant with, given its operations. The company has secured several partnerships this year to promote tokenization on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), including one with Ondo Finance to launch its tokenized treasuries on the network. Meanwhile, Ripple is known for its payment service, which is why the discussion around payments could be very insightful. It is worth noting that the crypto firm is expected to finalize its deal to acquire the stablecoin platform Rail around the time of the Swell event. As such, this could be one of the major talking points during the event. Ripple earlier highlighted why the Rail acquisition was strategic, as it would enable the company to offer virtual accounts and automated back-office infrastructure. Meanwhile, Ripple has had its fair share of dealing with regulators, particularly in light of the XRP lawsuit. As such, the regulatory topic at the Swell event is expected to garner significant attention, as the company’s executives discuss how they have navigated the regulatory landscape. Notably, the company’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), Stuart Alderoty, is also one of the featured speakers. In an X post, Ripple revealed that Chris Larsen and José Andrés will be the Keynote speakers at the event. XRP community members such as BankXRP shared their delight at the fact that Larsen will be speaking at the event. BankXRP noted that it has been a while since the Ripple co-founder has made an appearance. On the other hand, community members have questioned why Chef Andrés is speaking at the event and as a keynote speaker. Ripple didn’t reveal what the renowned chef will be speaking on. However, it could relate to the adoption of cryptocurrency in businesses or his humanitarian work, which is a significant development for the firm, considering its philanthropic efforts. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.90, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Cracker Barrel founder, 93, gives damning verdict on $7M-a-year CEO as she breaks cover after rebrand fiasco

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/29/2025 11:50:40 AM PDT by Morgana Cracker Barrel's co-founder has delivered a scathing critique of the restaurant chain's CEO after a botched rebranding. Tommy Lowe, 93, accused Julie Felss Masino of failing to grasp what Cracker Barrel stands for, pointing to her previous stint at Taco Bell. 'They're trying to modernize to be like the competition. Cracker Barrel doesn't have any competition,' Low, who co-founded Cracker Barrel with the late Dan Evins in Lebanon, Tennessee in 1969, told WTVF. 'I heard she was at Taco Bell. What's Taco Bell know about Cracker Barrel and country food? They need to work on the food and service and leave the barrel, the logo, alone.' The criticism comes after Cracker Barrel scrapped its controversial new logo Tuesday following a flood of outrage. The redesign removed the iconic 'Old Timer' figure — an old man leaning against a barrel — leaving only the chain's name in a modern font. Lowe weighed into the saga as Masino, who earns $6.68 million a year in salary and bonuses, was spotted Thursday leaving her home in an affluent Nashville neighborhood. When approached by Fox News Digital, Masino — who took the helm of the 650-location Southern comfort food chain in 2023 — refused to answer questions She quickly got into her Mercedes-Benz, flanked by security in another vehicle, and drove to a nearby Starbucks for coffee.

Once upon a time, someone would start at a company at the bottom. If they were good, they'd move up. Through each level. They would understand warehousing, distribution, marketing, retail, product development, recruiting, contracts, finance, whatever. If they made up to CEO they would understand the company culture and how to manage the company too. But we threw that out the window. Now, you graduate from an Ivy League school with your MBA and you instantly become CEO of an airline. After a few year, you become CEO of a brewery. A few more years, you are CEO of a semiconductor company. And after that, you get to run Cracker Barrel. You have no idea what you're doing at any of these positions. But you can fill in little numbers in little boxes in spreadsheets, and you give nice talks to shareholders, so I guess you have all the answers to all the problems. 8 posted on 08/29/2025 11:58:36 AM PDT by ClearCase_guy (Society has no reward for following the rules any more) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Jim W N Would you really want a female like that in charge of a home? 9 posted on 08/29/2025 11:59:34 AM PDT by Morgana ( “Abortion is the ultimate exploitation of women.” — Alice Paul 🇺🇸 ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: joshua c she would qualify for a bonus with this performance?

Title: Internal tensions rise as Meta races to beat the clock

Good morning from a wet and gloomy London. It's been a real pleasure writing to you each day, but I'm delighted to say your usual host, Dan DeFrancesco, returns from parental leave next week. Not to worry, this isn't quite goodbye. I'll be back in your inbox on Labor Day, and I'll continue working behind the scenes on this newsletter. Oh, and do keep in touch — whether it's feedback, questions, or recommendations for a decent pint in London. I'm at your service. Now, on to today's big story: BI's Jyoti Mann exclusively reports on Meta's race against time to launch one of its latest products. What's on deck: Markets: The brands Morgan Stanley's summer interns are splurging on. Tech: Here's who stands to benefit — and who might suffer — from the AI software shakeout. Business: Dollar General is racing to grow its one hour delivery service. But first, the clock is ticking. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Meta is in a race against time. And there's not long left on the clock. Meta's Superintelligence Labs is under pressure to release one of its first projects by year-end, according to insiders who spoke with BI. This team has been one to watch. Assembled with urgency, Mark Zuckerberg spared no expense, cherry-picking the very best talent. In June, Meta spent a staggering $14 billion to acquire nearly half of Scale AI — then promptly put its 28-year-old cofounder in charge of the Superintelligence push. That's just the tip of the iceberg. Meta has reportedly dangled compensation packages worth hundreds of millions to lure elite researchers from companies like OpenAI and Google DeepMind. But that strategy has rubbed some Meta employees the wrong way. As one former Meta researcher said, watching outsiders walk in with 10 to 50 times the compensation made some longtime staff feel like failures. Unsurprisingly, tensions are flaring. Some workers are threatening to jump ship to rivals. Others say they will quit on the spot to try to force Meta into negotiations. And so, less than two months after its launch, the cracks are beginning to show in Meta's Superintelligence Labs. At least eight employees have already left — including some who'd barely unpacked. Two OpenAI engineers reportedly lasted less than a month. We've seen the superstar hires. We've seen the eye-watering price tags. What we haven't seen? Results. When Meta rolled out its Llama 4 AI models in April, the crowd went mild. Developers felt it underdelivered in key areas like coding, reasoning, and following instructions. Now, BI's Jyoti Mann exclusively reports that the team is scrambling to fix the bugs, revive the product, and ship the next-gen release: Llama 4.X. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London. Meghan Morris, bureau chief, in Singapore. Akin Oyedele, deputy editor, in New York. Amanda Yen, associate editor, in New York. Lisa Ryan, executive editor, in New York.

Last year saw more than 150,000 job cuts across 549 companies, according to independent layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi. So far this year, more than 22,000 workers have been the victim of reductions across the tech industry, with a staggering 16,084 cuts taking place in February alone. We’re tracking layoffs in the tech industry in 2025 so you can see the trajectory of the cutbacks and understand the impact on innovation across all types of companies. As businesses continue to embrace AI and automation, this tracker serves as a reminder of the human impact of layoffs — and what could be at stake with increased innovation. Below you’ll find a comprehensive list of all the known tech layoffs that have occurred in 2025, which will be updated regularly. If you have a tip on a layoff, contact us here. If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can contact us here. Will eliminate 221 positions across its Milpitas and San Francisco offices, including 157 in Santa Clara County and 64 in San Francisco, effective October 13, according to filings with California’s Employment Development Department reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. The cuts are part of the company’s broader workforce-reduction strategy. Laid off about 100 employees last month, around 9% of its workforce, after falling short of ambitious growth targets. The cuts affected staff across all departments. The company provides back-office software for restaurant chains. Is set to cut 101 jobs at its Santa Clara location, with notices issued on August 13 and terminations effective October 13. The company, which recently disclosed nearly 200 layoffs at its Pleasanton and Redwood City offices, is also planning to lay off 161 employees in Seattle, according to filings with the Washington state Employment Security Department. Is cutting 106 positions at its Seattle and Liberty Lake, Washington, offices, according to a state Employment Security Department filing. The layoffs, which affected senior engineers and managers, are part of a broader global workforce reduction, although the security and application delivery company has not disclosed the total number of employees affected. Will cut 6% of its workforce in its sixth layoff in just over a year. Peloton CEO Peter Stern said the cuts are needed to improve long-term business health. Is cutting 10% of its workforce, or about 70 employees, as part of a cost-saving effort to reduce operating expenses by $8.5 million, marking its third round of layoffs since 2022. The corporate video software company plans to maintain and gradually grow its sales and marketing budgets, driven by a robust pipeline and growing adoption of its AI-powered offerings. Is laying off about 200 employees, roughly 34% of its global workforce, as it shuts down its email and SMS marketing operations. The Israeli-founded unicorn is partnering with Attentive and Omnisend to continue supporting marketing services while investing in AI-powered tools like automated review summaries, smart sorting, and a new Loyalty Tiers system. Laid off 30 employees and is now offering buyouts to the remaining 200. The AI coding startup recently acquired by Cognition has had a rocky stretch, including a near-acquisition by OpenAI and a reverse-acqui-hire by Google that saw key talent depart before Cognition stepped in. Despite initial promises to value Windsurf’s team, the deal now looks more focused on the startup’s intellectual property than its people. Is cutting 100 jobs, and its CEO, Jen Sargent, is departing. Amazon is reorganizing its audio operations, moving Wondery’s audio-only podcasts under Audible and placing video-focused shows into a new Creator Services division. Amazon acquired Wondery in 2020. Has cut 150 roles in customer service and support, following enhancements to its platform and tools that have significantly reduced support needs. The decision came via a prerecorded message from CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes, just hours before co-founder Scott Farquhar urged Australia to embrace an “AI revolution” and move beyond “jobs of the past” in an Australian Press Club address. The Australian software firm was founded 2002. Is cutting about 7% of its workforce, or 47 employees, as part of a push toward profitability, Bloomberg reports. The decision follows the recent acquisition of a startup with around 30 staff, who will stay on with the company. Despite the cuts, the blockchain software company that operates the popular digital wallet MetaMask says it will continue hiring for select roles. Is shutting down operations, per a report by Business Insider. The social collaging platform aimed at creators was founded in 2019 and raised $9 million in funding. Its closure highlights the persistent challenges social media startups face in building user bases and achieving long-term growth. Is laying off around 200 employees — roughly 14% of its workforce — and severing ties with 500 global contractors. The cuts come just weeks after Meta brought in the data-labeling startup’s CEO in a $14.3 billion deal. Plans to cut more than 100 U.S. full-time jobs, about 3% of its workforce, including positions at its Morrisville, North Carolina, campus. As of February 2024, the PC maker employed around 5,100 workers in the U.S. Is reportedly planning to lay off nearly 2,400 workers in Oregon, which is almost five times more than what was announced earlier this week. Last week, Intel announced that it will lay off more than 500 employees in Oregon, which is about 20% of its workforce, per Bloomberg. Plan to eliminate approximately 1,300 jobs combined as part of a larger restructuring effort to combine their operations and focus on AI. The layoff will mostly affect employees in the U.S., particularly in the R&D, HR, and sustainability teams, according to an internal memo by Hisayuki “Deko” Idekoba, the CEO of Recruit Holdings, which is the Japanese parent company of Indeed and Glassdoor. Has laid off 29 employees as part of its reorganization, per a report by Blockworks.

Title: SoundHound AI: What’s Happening With SOUN Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/29/soundhound-ai-whats-happening-with-soun-stock/
Time Published: 2025-08-29T14:23:38Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. From a humble start at $2 in early 2024, SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN), a voice AI platform enabling businesses to deliver conversational AI experiences, has seen its stock skyrocket by an astonishing 500% to its current price of around $13. This explosive ascent isn't just luck; it's a direct result of the company's compelling AI growth story, which has seen its technology become a staple in the automotive industry and expand into new frontiers. This monumental rise can be traced to three critical factors: So, the key question remains: Can these factors continue to propel SoundHound stock higher? We’ll delve into the specifics of what's driving this momentum and whether this AI growth story has the legs to keep soaring. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – CoreWeave Stock To $200? SoundHound AI’s strong revenue growth is far more than a simple market trend; it's the result of a deliberate and powerful three-pronged strategy that has transformed the company from a niche player into a diversified force. The most impactful move was the acquisition of Amelia in August 2024. This wasn't just a bolt-on purchase; it was a game-changing maneuver. By adding Amelia’s mature enterprise AI business and its substantial $45 million in recurring revenue, SoundHound didn't just grow—it supercharged its top line. This single strategic acquisition fundamentally reshaped the company's financial profile, providing a stable, high-value enterprise foundation that its previous business lacked. Historically, SoundHound was heavily reliant on the automotive sector, with over 90% of its revenue tied to a single industry. That dangerous dependency has been shattered. The company has executed a masterful diversification strategy, with well-balanced revenue streams now flowing from automotive, restaurants, financial services, healthcare, and insurance. This critical shift not only mitigates risk but also unlocks a vast array of new revenue streams, proving the company's technology is adaptable and in demand across multiple lucrative sectors. While diversification is key, SoundHound has not abandoned its core. The company has deepened its penetration in the automotive market, forging crucial partnerships with global powerhouses like Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Kia, and Stellantis brands such as Peugeot, Opel, and Alfa Romeo. This isn't just about selling a product; it’s about becoming an integral part of the next generation of in-vehicle technology. The recent broad rollout of its Chat AI to new Stellantis brands across Europe shows that this expansion is ongoing and gaining momentum, solidifying its position in this crucial market. While acquisitions and partnerships are the most visible drivers, a more fundamental force is at play: the company’s proprietary technology and product innovation. SoundHound’s Polaris foundation model and the launch of the Amelia 7.0 agentic AI (acts proactively) platform are key. These platforms offer superior accuracy and lower latency compared to rivals, which is a massive competitive advantage. It's this continuous technological edge that convinces major enterprises and automakers to choose SoundHound and is what allows the company to land new contracts and expand existing relationships. The tangible growth we see is the direct result of a superior product that's winning in the market. SoundHound AI’s valuation has exploded higher. Its price-to-sales ratio has skyrocketed from a rich 10.6x in 2023 to a staggering 37.6x today. This isn't just about revenue growth; it's a story of market frenzy driven by four powerful forces. While SoundHound's revenue surged by 187%, the stock's appreciation has been far more dramatic. The market is paying a premium for what it believes is a hyper-growth story. The projections of another 35% growth in 2025 and 65% by 2026 are fueling this narrative. This isn't just a bet on past performance; it's a forward-looking wager on a company they believe is just getting started. In the crowded tech landscape, SoundHound stands out as a pure-play voice AI company. Investors hungry for direct exposure to the AI theme have few alternatives, creating a scarcity premium that drives up its valuation. SoundHound offers a concentrated bet on a market that's just beginning to unlock its full potential. The recent acquisition of Amelia has allowed SoundHound to enter the lucrative enterprise generative AI market, a much larger playing field. This strategic move has fundamentally reshaped how investors perceive the company, justifying the higher multiples in their minds. The valuation expansion reflects a deep-seated optimism about SoundHound's future in this fast-growing sector. Finally, SoundHound's valuation is also a product of market momentum and speculation. The stock's extreme volatility has drawn in capital from traders and short-term investors, amplifying its moves during broader AI sector rallies. These technical factors have a self-fulfilling effect, pushing the valuation multiple even higher. Beyond these factors, a crucial, often-overlooked driver of SoundHound's valuation is the value of its unique data. Every voice command processed in a car, every order taken at a drive-thru, and every customer service interaction adds to its proprietary dataset. This data is the lifeblood of its AI models, making them smarter and more effective than a rival's. As the dataset grows, it creates a powerful network effect and a competitive moat. This is why major companies are signing long-term deals—they aren't just buying a service; they're contributing to and benefiting from an ever-improving AI. On a separate note, check out our take on – At $25 Is Pfizer Stock Deep Value Or A Falling Knife? At its current price of around $13, SoundHound's stock is trading at a lofty price-to-sales ratio of 37.6x, still below its two-year average of 48.7x. However, while the valuation multiple will likely compress to more reasonable levels, the strong growth in revenues will more than offset that, resulting in higher levels for SOUN stock. See, Voice AI is not just a feature for SoundHound; it's a transformative technology poised to revolutionize human-computer interaction across multiple industries. The company's strategic positioning in conversational AI is set to capitalize on a massive wave of digital transformation across its entire customer ecosystem. Voice AI is the new frontier for SoundHound AI, fueling a multi-industry revolution. The company is capitalizing on a massive digital transformation, solidifying its position as the go-to provider in the automotive sector through partnerships with giants like Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis. Beyond the car, its AI-powered conversational interfaces are transforming customer service in enterprise, while also unlocking new revenue streams in the restaurant and hospitality industries by enabling voice-activated ordering and reducing labor costs. This strategic expansion across multiple fronts is the engine behind its accelerating revenue growth. Despite its remarkable surge, SoundHound AI stock is a high-risk bet with a history of sharp, punishing downturns. Its journey is a masterclass in both extreme volatility and resilience. When markets turn sour, SoundHound doesn't just dip—it plummets. During the 2022 inflation-driven market sell-off, SOUN stock fell a staggering 94%, a far steeper and more painful drop than the S&P 500's 25% decline. This history proves that the stock can fall harder and faster than its peers, leaving investors with little room to maneuver. More recently, the stock suffered another major blow when Nvidia exited its stake in early 2025, a powerful signal that contributed to its later volatility. Beyond market-wide shocks, SoundHound faces significant, company-specific vulnerabilities. The Profitability Paradox: Despite its impressive revenue growth, SoundHound continues to burn through cash with persistent losses. A Crisis of Credibility: The company is grappling with allegations of misleading financial reporting and inflated goodwill. These accusations have created a credibility gap that increases risk for institutional investors and injects a new layer of volatility into the stock. The Valuation Disconnect: At a price-to-sales multiple of 38, SoundHound's stock is trading at lofty levels that may not reflect its underlying fundamentals. Without a clear timeline to profitability, a disconnect exists between its sky-high valuation and its financial reality. This makes it vulnerable to a sudden and significant correction. For a deeper dive into the specific risks that could trigger a severe downturn, we've outlined a full downside scenario in our separate analysis, SoundHound AI: The Downside Case. Despite its potential, SoundHound AI stock is a high-risk, high-reward investment. While near-term volatility will likely continue, the company's strong position in the fast-growing voice AI market, combined with its accelerating revenue and expanding partnerships, presents a compelling case for significant upside over the next two to three years. However, investors should be aware of the inherent risks, including a lofty valuation, intense competition, and a history of extreme volatility during market downturns, which could severely impact returns. See, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful, of stocks. Consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Strengthening the sustainability of neglected tropical disease programs in Rwanda: An assessment of access and utilization of domestically-financed services for soil-transmitted helminthiases and schistosomiasis
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371
Time Published: 2025-08-29T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) and schistosomiasis (SCH) infections remain some of the most prevalent neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), causing significant morbidity in most of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), including Rwanda. With dwindling international funding for NTD services and recent commitments focused on other diseases considered easier to eliminate as a public health problem, it is essential to assess domestic financing sources’ scale, efficiency, and effectiveness. The study aims to strengthen domestic efforts towards sustainable financing for neglected tropical disease programs in Africa, particularly in Rwanda. Up to 235 patients from 24 health centers in four districts of Rwanda were sampled for this survey. The districts selected had the highest number of STH and SCH based on routine data from June 2021 to December 2022, which is the window period of the study. We estimated affordability using the lowest-paid government worker (LPGW) and then compared this with household income and expenditure obtained from patients participating in the survey. Data was collected from August to September 2023. Limited secondary data were collected to complement primary data. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to present the findings. The most available drugs were mebendazole, with 100% of facilities reporting no stockout. Praziquantel (PZQ) was the most unavailable drug, reporting 92% stockout at the time of the survey, mainly due to delays in getting supplies from MDA-implementing health facilities. Diagnostics for SCH are the most inaccessible lab services. On average, the total cost (both direct and opportunity cost) to access and utilize STH and SCH services was USD 0.72 (RWF 861.92) and USD 0.96 (RWF 1136.41) for male and female patients, respectively. Although the assessment revealed that treatment for STH and SCH was affordable for the LPGW, women pay a 33% higher cost than men to access NTD services. While services are generally satisfactory, the reimbursement processes are slow, hindering timely access and utilization of SCH and STH services at the health facilities in Rwanda. While the access and utilization of STH and SCH services in health centers are generally promising, the findings underscore the potential for improvement. By addressing the efficiency in the supply of praziquantel drugs and enhancing reimbursement timelines, we can ensure the continuity and effectiveness of these services, offering hope for a brighter future in the fight against neglected tropical diseases. This study explores how Rwanda is working to sustainably finance healthcare services for two neglected tropical diseases—soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and schistosomiasis (SCH)—as international aid for such diseases declines. The research surveyed 235 patients across 24 health centers in districts most affected by these conditions, focusing on how accessible, affordable, and well-utilized these services are under Rwanda’s domestic health financing mechanisms. Key findings show that while basic medications like mebendazole are widely available, others like praziquantel face frequent stockouts due to delayed reimbursements from the CBHI to clinics. Women experience longer travel and waiting times, resulting in higher opportunity costs than men. Yet, out-of-pocket expenses remain low—under USD 1 per visit—suggesting minimal financial risk to patients across income brackets. Patients rated the quality and acceptability of services highly, though most facilities lacked NTD treatment protocols. The study underscores how domestic efforts—such as budget allocations and health insurance coverage—have helped improve access. However, it stresses the need to streamline reimbursement processes and strengthen supply chains to avoid disruptions in drug availability. The findings provide valuable insight for policymakers aiming to reduce dependency on external funding while enhancing equitable access to NTD care.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Health systems across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) pose significant barriers to the population’s access to health services. There are infrastructural gaps, particularly in rural areas, which experience geographical barriers to health facilities, poor medical supplies, and weak digital health infrastructure [1]. Human resource shortages, urban-biased distribution, and governance challenges continue to pose essential access barriers [2]. Apart from these, perhaps the most significant challenge remains financing, where many countries on the continent are far from meeting their health financing goals, e.g., less than seven countries met the Abuja target, and many countries’ out-of-pocket payments remain unacceptably high with low domestic spending and continued reliance on external resources [3]. With increasing anxiety over the long-term financing from external sources exemplified by the exit of USAID and sustainability challenges, one program area of concern is the financing of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). NTDs are diverse communicable yet preventable parasitic, viral, and bacterial diseases that affect over 1.0 billion of the world’s poorest and vulnerable populations primarily in tropical and sub‐tropical settings in Africa, Asia, and the Americas [4–6]. Up to 40% of the affected populations live in Africa, with the poorest and most vulnerable residing in hard-to-reach geographical areas [7–9]. Among the most prevalent NTDs, schistosomiasis (SCH) and soil-transmitted helminths (STH), or intestinal worms, remain a global public health concern and are highly prevalent in low and middle-income countries. They primarily affect poor communities with no access to potable water [10]. It is estimated that about 251.4 million people globally required preventive treatment for SCH in 2021, of which 93% of the total burden is found in sub-Saharan Africa [11]. Despite the existence of treatment and preventive measures, NTDs continue to be responsible for many years of life lost due to disability and premature death among the poor [12]. NTDs, therefore, constitute a disproportionate health burden to marginalized populations and exacerbate inequity. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3) seek to close the health equity gap and have highlighted NTDs as necessary in achieving this objective. Improving access to NTD services is paramount to the SDGs agenda of reducing disease burden and improving health outcomes for all. Among children, NTDs contribute to disabilities and cognitive impairment, limiting their ability to progress with education and improve their living standards in adulthood [13]. Among adults, NTDs limit productivity and directly impact economic development [14]. Factors that exacerbate the NTD burden include poverty and marginalization, underfunding for health systems, and poor surveillance data [15,16]. The endemicity, the burden, and poor financing of NTDs in Africa are well documented [6,13,16–21]. Rwanda is considered one of the best-performing countries in Africa in its efforts to improve access to health services through public health insurance schemes and increased government spending on healthcare. For example, while Rwanda’s current health expenditure as a share of GDP stands at about 7.2%, its neighbours such as Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda and Tanzania average 3% of GDP as of 2020 [22] However, the country remains endemic for two of the five NTDs amenable to preventive chemotherapy (PC) [23]. National prevalence of SCH ranged between 0% and 70% in areas surrounding water bodies in 2008, and the prevalence has declined significantly over the years, according to recent assessment reports [23,24]. In 2020, data yet to be published by the Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC) showed that the threshold for elimination as a public health problem was reached in 97% of high-risk villages selected to assess the impact. In contrast, the national prevalence of STH infections stood at 41% as of 2020 [7,23,25]. However, the 2020 impact assessment found that adults remain the most infected compared to school-aged children, i.e., 48% versus 41%. In light of diminishing international support for NTD programs [26], and to maintain the gains in the fight against NTDs and increase service coverage for all, there is greater emphasis on domestic financing for sustainability. Currently, financing STH, SCH, and other related NTDs in Rwanda heavily depends on external sources. From the approved budgets, the funding for STH and SCH was RWF 6,250.59 million (USD 6.16 million) in the financial year 2021/22 and RWF 9048.54 million (USD 8.46 million) in 2022/23. External sources accounted for almost 92% of overall STH and SCH spending RWF 14,032.71 (USD 13.47 million) in the FYs 2021/22 and 2022/23. However, the government contribution significantly increased from RWF 126.33 (USD 0.12) million in 2021/22 to RWF 1100.388 (USD 1.07) million in 2022/23. Despite the increase in government budget, external funding remains significant and could grossly affect NTD service delivery if abruptly cut. To reduce dependency on external funding for NTDs, the government aims to increase budget allocation to account for at least 40% of the NTD budget to ensure sustainability [27]. Alongside budget increases, the Rwandan Government has improved access to NTD services by rolling out bi-annual mass drug administration (MDA), ensuring that over 65 million treatments against intestinal worms and schistosomiasis were delivered to children aged 1–15 years since 2008 [28]. The government has taken further steps to improve access to NTD treatment and preventive services by progressively integrating NTDs into the national health insurance benefit package- the Community-Based Health Insurance (CBHI) scheme. Rwanda’s CBHI scheme was initiated by the Rwandan Government in 2005 to spread the financial burden of medical costs and ensure that the poor and vulnerable households have access to essential health services without incurring a financial burden [29]. The government subsidizes the CBHI scheme at almost 50% of the total funding [29–31]. The benefits package includes comprehensive preventive and curative services and essential drugs at health centers and referral hospitals. Integrating NTDs into the routine health services delivery system is a crucial indicator for domestic financing and is considered a key step toward sustainable NTD programming in endemic countries [32]. While the efforts to eliminate NTDs through sustainable financing in Rwanda are commendable, there are empirical gaps on whether the current funding from domestic sources (government and public insurance) has improved NTD service availability, affordability, and optimized utilization by the population to contribute toward sustainable elimination. For instance, STH and SCH services are expected to be available and affordable to all those in need of the services, but the range of services covered, their availability, demand, and utilization, and who bears the cost burden in trying to access SCH and STH services, is not well-understood in Rwanda. The aim of this study is, therefore, to provide evidence on the implications of public financing of NTDs on service access. This will assist the government and the CBHI in improving domestic resource mobilization and allocation for effective and sustainable NTD elimination. A protocol was submitted to the Ethics and Scientific Review Committee of the Rwanda National Research Ethics Committee (RNEC) and the Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC). Approval for the study was received from RNEC (RNEC-IRB 0001497 of I0RGOOO1100) on August 11, 2023—collaboration letter from the Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC), Ref. No M84/RBC/2023, provided a human subjects exemption for this research on 13 October 2023. The study relied mainly on primary survey data collected through exit interviews. Secondary data were collected to inform the NTD financing situation in Rwanda and to understand the government budget for operational costs related to mass drug administration (MDA). This study was conducted in 24 randomly selected health centers in four Rwanda districts: Gisagara, Rubavu, Burera, and Rutsiro. These are amongst the districts with the co-endemicity for STH and Schistosomiasis as reported in the Rwanda NTDs Strategic Plan 2019–2024 [24]. In addition, these districts had a high number of STH and SCH, all combined from June 2021 to December 2022, which is the window period of the study. All the selected health centers were providing STH and SCH services (deworming medications including albendazole, mebendazole, and praziquantel; diagnostics for Schistosomiasis (SCH) and STH or intestinal worms) covered by the CBHI scheme. The sample size was calculated using the SCH and STH facility visits data for 2022, which was estimated at 207,572 visits. Assuming each of the 24 facilities had an equal number of visits during the year 2022, each facility received about 8649 SCH and STH patients, which translates to about 24 visits per day in each facility. Aiming for a higher sample size, the study chose to interview 50% of the census sample, i.e., every second patient in each facility was interviewed, which gave a total sample size of 288 SCH and STH patients. 235 patients were accepted to participate in the study, with an acceptable response rate of about 82%. In addition, 24 facility in-charges from the 24 health facilities were interviewed to assess stock levels of SCH and STH drugs. A total of four data collectors were assigned responsibility for collecting data at each of the 24 facilities. Each two-person team split responsibility between collecting facility data of individual facilities and interviewing individual study participants to assess the availability, affordability, and utilization of STH and SCH services. Data collection was completed between August and September 2023. Exit interview participants were recruited from the 24 facilities among the target populations in need of STH and SCH services who came to a study site seeking these services. Individual participants were selected after they had received STH and SCH services at the respective facility. The research assistants explained the study to each potential participant, using an approved recruitment script, and all respondents were asked if they were willing to voluntarily participate in the study. All willing participants signed a consent form after acknowledging their understanding of the purpose of the study. Exit interviews were conducted with each eligible participant based on their willingness to participate. The information collected included demographic characteristics of the respondents (age, religion, membership in a health insurance scheme, marital status, individual income, household income, level of education, employment status), transport costs, amount paid for drugs, travel time to and from the facility, and waiting time. English and Kinyarwanda translations of the participant and facility questionnaires were loaded onto a mobile data collection application, KoBoCollect, which was used to record responses. In this study, we considered three key dimensions of access [33] which include: (i) availability of services (drugs and non-drug pharmaceuticals, physical accessibility including distance to facility and travel time, and availability of qualified staff (ii) affordability of services including cost of medicine, travel costs, cost of consultation incurred concerning tests/investigations, other indirect costs); (iii) acceptability of services such as social and cultural context (gender) affecting accessibility, and individual patient perceptions of quality of services. Accessibility was assessed using the WHO availability target of greater than or equal to 80%. Affordability was estimated based on the average monthly wage for the lowest-paid government worker (LPGW). From an economic costing perspective, affordability was also estimated using direct financial expenses and opportunity costs. Costs to STH and SCH patients are largely restricted to the charges for the transport costs incurred from home to the treatment site and opportunity costs. The out-of-pocket costs included round-trip transportation costs, which were assessed through the exit interviews, and the time required for obtaining treatment, which included the round-trip travel time to the facility, waiting time, and time for consultation until exit from the facility. The patient’s daily earnings give an estimate of the value of time spent at the health facility. Data were analyzed using STATA version 17. Simple descriptive statistics assessed the availability, affordability, and utilization/demand of the selected STH and SCH drugs and related services. An availability of 80% or higher was used as the benchmark for accessibility as per WHO guidelines [34]. The combined availability of commodities that were surveyed was calculated to provide the overall availability of that specific commodity at the facility. Stockout information was sought from all the selected STH and SCH commodities covered by the CBHI scheme, which were supposed to be available at that level of care, regardless of whether they were in or out of stock at the time of the survey. Stockout was calculated as the percentage of facilities that reported at least one stockout of the selected STH and SCH commodity over the measured period, with stockout days calculated as the average number of days stockouts of a commodity lasted per facility. To calculate affordability, the median price of the entire treatment course of a commodity was compared to the official salary of the lowest-paid government worker (LPGW), per day in 2023. If a commodity price exceeded one day’s wages, it would be considered unaffordable based on the World Bank’s international poverty line (IPL) of USD 2.15 per person per day. Accessibility was calculated using the availability and LPGW affordability measures. This resulted in a composite measure in which accessibility is achieved with an 80% or higher availability and a price of less than a day’s wage for an LPGW. The results were then compared with information on income and expenditure obtained from patients participating in the survey. The results, presented in Table 1, revealed that the respondents tended to be young, with 39.2% under 30 years old. About the same number of respondents were single and never married (28%) or were living together (28.1%). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t001 As depicted in Fig 1, almost all the patients (99%) received consultation services, 29.8% received SCH diagnostic services, and 85% received STH diagnostics. A third of the respondents (33%) received the prescribed albendazole medicine, and 66.8% and 12.8% received the prescribed mebendazole and praziquantel medicines. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.g001 Regarding stockouts of STH and SCH drugs on the day of the survey (Fig 2), 22 (92%) out of the 24 facilities did not have praziquantel drugs, and 11 (46%) had no diagnostics for STH or intestinal worms. In comparison, diagnostics for schistosomiasis were unavailable in 14 (58%) of the facilities. However, mebendazole drugs were available in all 24 health facilities. Note that, as the primary strategy for the NTD elimination programs, preventive chemotherapy (PC) employs anthelmintics, such as albendazole (ADZ) or mebendazole (MBDZ) for STHs, ADZ and diethylcarbamazine (DEC) and/or ivermectin (IVM) for LF and onchocerciasis, and praziquantel (PZQT) for SCH [35]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.g002 The stockout of STH/SCH drugs forced patients to either use an alternative drug, e.g., mebendazole in place of albendazole, or to visit the facility another day when supplies were available. Alternatively, those who could afford it were advised by health workers to purchase at private facilities. As noted by the study, one of the major contributors to drug stockouts is a delay in receiving reimbursements for services provided. At the time of the survey, 23 out of the 24 facilities in the sample indicated that they experienced delays in receiving reimbursements from the CBHI through the Rwanda Social Security Board (RSSB) for services provided during FY 2021/22 and FY 2022/23. Table 2 presents the estimated number of months of delays in receiving the funds. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t002 About 75% of the facilities experienced 2–4 months of delays. The respondents cited several causes for the delays, including errors in preparing the invoice (37.5%), delays in submitting the invoice by the facilities (45.8%), delayed reimbursement from the CBHI scheme (79.2%), and delays in verifying the invoices (20.8%). The delayed reimbursement does not affect SCH and STH services alone, but the availability of all services is affected since health facilities cannot replenish their entire stocks before funds are made available. The study also considered the time taken to receive services (travel and waiting time) as a measure of availability in the timely use of NTD services. On average, women spent more time than men receiving NTD services (307.4 minutes or 5.0 hours for women compared to 238.5 minutes or 4.0 hours for men). In travel time, women spent about 95.93 minutes (approximately 2 hours) traveling to health facilities versus 78.94 minutes (approximately 1.3 hours) spent by men. Similarly, average time spent with the clinician, average waiting time, and average time after consultation to exit the facility were approximately 159.6 minutes (approximately 2.6 hours) for male patients and 211.5 minutes (3.5 hours) for female patients (Table 3). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t003 There was no immediate explanation for the differences between men and women in the time taken to receive services. However, less travel time and higher transport costs for men compared to women indicate that more men than women used motorbikes or other faster and more expensive means of transportation to the health facility. This suggests an economic advantage for men in accessing health facilities. A summary of patients’ indirect costs (cost of travel and waiting time), direct costs, and total costs for accessing STH and SCH treatment is presented in Table 4. The average total cost (including both direct and opportunity costs) to access and utilize STH and SCH services was US$0.72 (RWF 834.08) and US$0.96 (RWF 1,112.11) for male and female respondents, respectively. The average total cost for the opportunity costs accounted for 1.5% (US$0.45 or RWF 521.30) of the total average cost per day for male respondents. In comparison, the opportunity cost for female respondents accounted for 2.4% (US$0.68 or RWF 787.75) of the total cost per day. The out-of-pocket costs for transportation fares amounted to $0.09 (RWF 104.26) and $0.06 (RWF 69.51) for male and female respondents, respectively. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t004 The findings indicate that the average daily income was highest among male respondents at RWF1,784.01 (US$1.54) against RWF 1,702.92 (US$1.47) for females. The results show disparity in the costs for male and female respondents, which is largely driven by the amount of travel time and, hence, the cost per round trip. Table 5 presents the total average cost of time for the daily visits. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t005 The total cost to patients accessing STH and SCH services for a month was compared with the average monthly household income (Table 5). The results show that male patients paid direct costs of nearly US$0.28 (about 0.95% of average household income per month) for a month (assuming one visit to the health facility per month) to access treatment services at the facilities. The share of direct costs paid by female patients was US$0.28, which is about 0.99% of the average household income per month of US$28.30. The direct costs combined with indirect costs produced a total mean cost burden of US$0.72 or 3.4% of household income per month for male patients and a mean total cost per month of US$0.96 or 2.5% of average monthly household income for female patients (Fig 3). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.g003 The total direct and indirect costs as a share of household income are presented in Table 6. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t006 The results show that the poorest households spent about 3.3% of their income on STH and SCH care. On the other hand, those in the middle—and upper-income brackets spent between 1.7% and 2.5% of their income on STH and SCH care and treatment. The wealthiest households with an income of RWF 250,000 spent 4.7% on STH and SCH treatment and care. These findings, including on the expenditures of LPGW, show no real financial risk involving catastrophic payments for STH and SCH services. These findings show that the cost burden of SCH and STH services is progressive because of government subsidies that target low-income earners. Higher income brackets are also likely to spend more on faster means of transportation and also pay out of pocket during stockouts. Costs by district show Rubavu District is the most expensive for those seeking SCH and STH services. Women incur the highest cost averaging about USD 1.37 against men who incur USD 0.83 per trip (Table 7). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t007 In addition to cost, the quality of services is an important determinant of using STH and SCH services. In this study, respondents were asked to record their level of satisfaction concerning: (i) quality of treatment received, ii) privacy and confidentiality, iii) timeliness in the provision of services, (iv) facility cleanliness and hygiene, (v) attitude towards patients, (vi) overall rating. A rating scale (excellent, good, fair, and poor) was used. Most respondents (78.3%) rated the services provided as good, while 17.5% rated them as fair and 1.7% rated the services as poor. Other aspects of acceptability (e.g., cleanliness and hygiene, privacy of treatment and waiting time, and staff attitude) were similar, indicating that an overwhelming majority of the respondents viewed the services as acceptable (Table 8). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t008 In addition, the study assessed the availability of treatment protocols as a measure of improved patient-centered outcomes. The survey results revealed that 21 (88%) of the facilities did not have NTD treatment protocols for various NTDs, and only three facilities reported availability of treatment protocols for NTDs. The utilization of STH and SCH services decreased slightly from 215,267 OPD visits in 2021–207,572 OPD visits in 2022 (Table 9). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t009 The data show that most STH and SCH patients were treated asymptomatically. Patients receiving intestinal worm medications (mebendazole or albendazole) accounted for 82.3% of the total outpatient (OPD) visits over the two years. In contrast, diagnostics accounted for 17.3% of the visits for STH and 4% for SCH. In terms of utilization by district, the health facilities in Burera district accounted for 29.1% and 29.7%, respectively, of the total utilization of STH and SCH services, followed by Rubavu, which accounted for 26.7% and 26.2% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Facilities in the Gisagara district reported the lowest utilization, at 17.7% in 2021 and 18.8% in 2022 (Table 10). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t010 The number of OPD visits for all STH and SCH services during the two years declined slightly, except for intestinal worm medication. The largest drop in outpatient utilization (OPD) was observed in the diagnostics for Schistosomiasis (from 1732 OPD visits in 2021–136 OPD visits in 2022), followed by patients for deworming medications (mebendazole), whose utilization declined from 79,233 in 2021–70,826. There are concerns about access and sustainability of health services in general and NTD programs in particular due to overreliance on external funding and low domestic investments. Sustainability means the capacity of a health system to maintain the gains toward NTD prevention and control on the path to elimination. Poor access to NTD services has broader policy implications beyond the health system. It imposes an economic burden by reducing productivity and contributes to a cycle of poverty and social exclusion [36]. Late-stage presentations of most NTDs are not just fatal but are a significant burden to health facilities and jeopardize progress toward Universal Health Coverage. The United Nations SDGs recognize universal access to NTD services as integral to achieving UHC [37]. On the other hand, children afflicted with NTDs have lower educational achievement as NTDs increase absenteeism and cognitive impairment, therefore potentially contributing to lower social status [13,38]. As a largely neglected program in many low- and middle-income countries, countries are encouraged to invest domestic resources to control and eliminate NTDs. In Rwanda, the bulk (90%) of funding for STH and SCH prevention and elimination is external. However, the Rwanda Government has progressively relied less on external support to control and eliminate NTDs. The steps include (i) the introduction of a budget line for procurement of NTD drugs, (ii) the design and delivery of a package of NTD care under the CBHI scheme, (iii) the adoption of one health policy that commits to enhance collaboration of different actors of NTD stakeholders, (iv) budget allocation for MDA operational costs, and (v) decentralization of NTD interventions and integration of NTD prevention efforts to the village level under district coordination. The study focused on understanding how public domestic financing through the Rwandan government’s introduction of a budget line for NTD drugs and financing under the CBHI scheme has influenced access to and utilization of SCH and STH services in Rwanda. The introduction of a budget vote influences access to healthcare by guaranteeing a resource basket, affecting the funding available for health services [39]. In so doing, it contributes to financial risk protection by lowering the cost of care for individuals. There is a growing body of literature on NTD service access (availability, affordability, and utilization) with mixed results [16,40–42]; e.g., in Ethiopia, Kassahun et al. [40] showed that service availability is relatively good with up to 64% of all health facilities offering STH services, but only 40% had SCH services. Our findings show a similar trajectory of inconsistency in the availability of SCH and STH drugs; e.g., praziquantel is the least available medicine with a stockout rate of 92% because of delays in receiving supplies from MDA implementing health facilities. This is followed by albendazole, received by just 33% of patients seeking care. On the other hand, mebendazole was the most available drug with 100% facilities stocked. In other NTDs, Ooms et al. [41] report low availability of snakebite commodities (43%) in public health facilities. Similarly, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute [43] found that the availability of drugs for NTD treatment varied by facility type, with hospitals more likely than lower-level facilities to be stocked. One of the most cited causes of stockouts of essential drugs is delayed reimbursements to health facilities to allow for timely re-stocking of commodities [44,45]. The consequences of a lack of availability of essential NTD services are not only costly to those seeking care but also discourage repeat visits, which constitutes a barrier to NTD control and elimination. The reimbursements to facilities need to be predictable and the supply chain strengthened, to ensure consistency in the availability of critical NTD services, particularly those prepaid through publicly financed institutions. The availability of SCH and STH services is hampered by distance to health facilities, with women disproportionately affected. Of the 85% of the respondents who walked to a health facility, women spent on average 96 minutes compared to 79 minutes spent by men. The extra time spent by women traveling to health facilities not only has cost implications but also constitutes a physical barrier to accessing NTD services. Although the government took steps to reduce walking time to facilities by 50% (from 95 minutes to 47 minutes) in 2020 [46], the evidence suggests that there are still significant challenges in accessing health facilities in some districts. The steps taken by the government include the construction of health posts and the deployment of community health workers to bring services closer to communities [46]. The use of CHWs to bring NTD services closer to the communities has been proven effective in malaria control and improving maternal and child health services [47,48]. It is highly recommended for effective and sustainable control and elimination of NTDs. What remains encouraging in Rwanda is that SCH and STH services remain essentially affordable with no evidence of catastrophic expenses. Usually, out-of-pocket health expenditure is considered catastrophic and impoverishing when a household is forced to cut down on subsistence needs, sell productive assets, incur debts, or utilize savings to meet health needs [34,41,49,50]. Similar to this study, Dong et. al. [51] reported better affordability overall but also noted a large gap between the affordability levels of originator brands (OBs) and lowest-priced generics (LPGs) of essential drugs in Ethiopia. The affordability of SCH and STH services in Rwanda was primarily influenced by travel and waiting time, whose costs were higher than the expenses for the actual NTD services at health facilities. Noting that the indirect medical expenses disproportionately affected women calls for considering the driving factors in the analysis of access to NTD services in a low-resource setting, such as Rwanda. Women spent about a dollar more than men to access health facilities- a cost mainly attributed to more extended travel and waiting time, which are likely to be an important determinant of STH and SCH services utilization. Saxena et al. [52] have reported cost-related disparities between men and women in access to healthcare. Affordability is a critical determinant of access to health services in most settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Generally, essential health services are found to be relatively unaffordable to many people [16,42,49,53–55]. However, treatment costs for STH and SCH services are affordable in a low-income setting, requiring only 13% of a day’s wages from the LPGW. This suggests that NTD control and prevention is one of the best buys in public health available to those affected community members. Studies such as Ooms et. al. [40] have also demonstrated the affordability of NTD services, excluding snake anti-venoms, which are found to be unaffordable to most households in Kenya. Governments should, therefore, be encouraged to invest more in NTD control and elimination as a less costly alternative to the continued neglect of NTDs. Rwanda currently funds operational costs of MDAs, which indicates that significant costs can be domestically resourced when appropriately prioritized through political commitment, effective advocacy, governance, multisectoral coordination structures, and integration within the broader health system budgeting and planning processes. Evidence of steady demand and utilization of STH and SCH services in Rwanda indicates efficiency in the use of investments in NTDs, wherein the target population utilizes the services purchased; i.e., the population’s NTD needs are well aligned with the services purchased. There is also a clear linkage between service use and the reported high patient satisfaction with the services offered. However, the demand and utilization can still be improved with timely reimbursements to health facilities and a strengthened procurement and supply chain for NTD commodities. Satisfaction with health services is a contentious issue, especially in LMIC, with many reporting poor services associated mainly with poor staff attitude, ineffective physician consultations, and inefficient admission process [52,53]. However, in Ghana, there was an overwhelming majority (>95%) of patients who had a positive perception of the quality of services [19]. Our study reported 95.3% satisfaction with SCH and STH services, which means that, although the quality of services is generally low in low-resource settings, there is evidence from both the Ghanaian and Rwandan experiences that this can change for the better. The WHO emphasizes that the goals of UHC cannot be effectively achieved if the quality of services is not satisfactory. The surest way to sustain and eliminate neglected diseases is to combine adequate domestic financing with improved access to and utilization of quality NTD services. This combination needs to be approached from an equity lens, considering the identified gender gaps in access to SCH and STH services. The study is aware of biases related to self-reported data and ensured that the data collected from individual participants were triangulated with discussions with health workers. Micro-level gaps, such as socioeconomic indicators and behavioral determinants of health, were either not relevant to the objective of the study or addressed by having well-trained interviewers to ensure data consistency. The generalizability concerns have been addressed through triangulated data sources and a non-biased sampling process of 24 primary health facilities in different districts representing urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. However, the study acknowledges that the small sample size focusing on primary health facilities may limit generalization in hospital settings. We sincerely appreciate all the respondents who took the time to participate in the survey. We are also grateful to the senior staff at the Rwanda Biomedical Center (RBC) and the Ministry of Health for their kind support during the entire data collection period. We also thank the facility in-charges for their cooperation during this study.

Title: Bitcoin Miner IREN's AI Push Gains Momentum, Price Target Hiked 60% to $37: Canaccord

IREN (IREN) reported fourth-quarter results that highlighted rapid progress in both its bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence infrastructure businesses, according to a Friday research report by broker Canaccord Genuity. The broker reiterated its buy rating on the stock and hiked its price target 60% to $37 from $24, citing stronger visibility in both mining and AI revenue streams. In early trading, shares are higher by 25% to $28.75. The company’s mining unit reached an annualized revenue run rate above $1 billion, powered by 50 exahash per second (EH/s) of capacity and one of the industry’s most efficient fleets at 15 J/TH, operating on 3.5 cent/kWh power, analysts led by Joseph Vafi wrote. That translates into a $36,000 cost to mine a bitcoin, well below market levels. Bitcoin mining revenue came in at $187.3 million for the quarter, up 33% sequentially, while adjusted EBITDA jumped 46% to $121.9 million. On the AI side, IREN is accelerating expansion, the report noted. The bitcoin miner quadrupled its hashrate and added another megawatt of power capacity, now totaling 3 MW, with further growth expected in fiscal 2025. The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty. Canaccord also noted IREN's recent designation as an NVIDIA (NVDA) preferred partner, which came almost simultaneously with the announcement of the purchase of an additional 2,400 GPUs. With 2,910 MW of secured power capacity and some of the lowest all-in cash costs in the industry, Canaccord argues IREN is positioned to become one of the largest and most efficient publicly listed miners, with significant optionality in high-performance computing.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. In early 2023, Amazon's stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) was trading at a modest $84. Today, it has soared to $232, a stunning 176% jump that significantly outpaces the broader NASDAQ index's 2x rise. So, what's fueling this incredible surge? The answer lies in three critical factors: But the question remains: Can this powerhouse performance continue? We’ll dive into what’s driving this momentum and what the future holds for Amazon. But if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – CoreWeave Stock To $200? Beyond its sheer size, Amazon's revenue growth is driven by a hidden engine: a powerful shift in its business model. While its e-commerce sales are impressive, they are no longer the primary force. The real story lies in the company's strategic diversification, with three key areas serving as the main catalysts for its recent surge. The undisputed heavyweight champion of Amazon's growth is Amazon Web Services (AWS). This cloud computing arm has proven to be an exceptionally valuable asset, far outpacing the growth of Amazon's traditional retail operations. While North American and international sales grew by 23% and 21% respectively between 2022 and 2024, AWS revenue surged by a solid 34% over the same period. Its high-margin, scalable services for businesses, governments, and individuals make it the company's most important growth engine. Another crucial, and often overlooked, driver of Amazon's financial success is its rapidly expanding digital advertising business. Much like Google and Meta, Amazon has leveraged its vast customer data and massive platform to become a dominant player in the ad world. This segment, which includes sponsored product listings and display ads, has been growing at a remarkable pace, providing a high-profit-margin revenue stream that diversifies the company's earnings beyond e-commerce and cloud services. Amazon's third major growth driver is its subscription services, most notably its Prime membership, which has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem of benefits beyond free shipping to include streaming video and music, exclusive deals, and more. This has created a loyal and engaged customer base that not only pays a recurring fee but also spends more on Amazon's platform than non-Prime members. This steady, predictable revenue stream provides a solid financial foundation and strengthens the company's competitive moat. Looking ahead, these drivers face a new challenge: the intense competition in the AI arms race. AWS's leadership in cloud computing is being challenged by rivals like Microsoft (Azure) and Google (Cloud), who are making massive investments in generative AI. Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI and Google's rapid expansion of AI services pose a significant threat. To maintain its market leadership, Amazon is also pouring tens of billions into AI-related capital expenditures, a strategic move that will shape its future and determine if its extraordinary growth can continue. Amazon's stunning rise in valuation can be attributed to its dramatic financial transformation, where a once-unprofitable e-commerce giant has become a profit-making powerhouse. This shift has reshaped investor sentiment and sent its valuation soaring. The most significant catalyst behind this change is AWS. This high-margin cloud business has single-handedly revolutionized Amazon's profitability. Since 2022, Amazon's operating margin has skyrocketed by an astounding 377%, climbing from a meager 2.4% to a robust 11.4%. This incredible expansion in profitability, fueled by AWS, is the key reason investors are now willing to pay a premium for Amazon's stock. It signals a new era of sustainable, high-quality earnings. This surge in profitability, combined with strong revenue growth and the strategic expansion of AWS, has directly impacted Amazon’s valuation. Investors now value the company as a technology and cloud leader. As a result, the company's price-to-sales valuation multiple has ballooned by 124%, jumping from 1.7x trailing revenues in 2022 to an impressive 3.7x today. This multiple expansion is a direct reflection of the market's newfound confidence in Amazon's long-term profit potential. At its current price of around $230, Amazon's stock is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.7x, which aligns closely with its five-year average of 3.2x. However, there are compelling reasons to believe the valuation multiple could expand further. See, AI is not just a buzzword for Amazon; it's a strategic weapon poised to supercharge its growth and reshape its financial future. The company's massive investments in artificial intelligence are set to ignite a new wave of expansion across its entire business empire. Within AWS, AI is the new frontier. As businesses race to develop and deploy their own AI applications, they are driving unprecedented demand for AWS's cloud infrastructure. This isn't just about incremental growth; it's a direct catalyst for skyrocketing cloud sales, solidifying AWS's position as a profit powerhouse. In fact, if you want a detailed breakdown of how this growth can help Amazon's stock, take a look at our analysis – Amazon Stock: Path to 2x Growth – which highlights the key factors. But the AI revolution isn't limited to the cloud. On the retail side, AI is being woven into the very fabric of the shopping experience. Think smarter product recommendations, lightning-fast search, and deeply personalized storefronts. These aren't just minor upgrades—they're powerful tools designed to boost sales, increase the value of every order, and make advertising on the platform more effective than ever. This enhanced ad targeting will also extend its influence across the wider digital advertising landscape, creating a lucrative new revenue stream. All of this adds up to a compelling financial outlook. Amazon projects low double-digit sales growth over the next three years, with its bottom-line profits expected to grow even faster. This blend of accelerating profitability, continued AWS dominance, and an ironclad grip on the e-commerce market, presents a powerful case for a higher valuation. Investors are already taking notice, recognizing that Amazon's strategic AI initiatives are not just a plan—they're the blueprint for a new era of growth and value creation. Despite its powerful rise, Amazon’s stock is not without its vulnerabilities. Its history is marked by sharp drops that have far outpaced the broader market, highlighting both its inherent volatility and remarkable resilience. During the 2022 inflation-driven market sell-off, Amazon stock plunged a staggering 52%, a far steeper decline than the S&P 500's 25% drop. The stock's recovery took over a year, not regaining its previous high until February 2024. More recently, during periods of heightened trade war concerns, the pattern repeated—Amazon plummeted 30% while the S&P 500's peak-to-trough decline was a more modest 19%. This history shows that when markets turn, Amazon can fall harder and faster than its peers. Beyond market-wide shocks, the company faces significant company-specific risks. A primary concern is its massive capital expenditure. Since 2022, Amazon has invested a colossal $257 billion in CapEx. This is a high-stakes gamble, and a critical question looms: What if these massive investments don't yield the returns investors expect? Simultaneously, the explosive growth of its core profit driver, AWS, could be threatened by intense competition from rivals like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. A slowdown in AWS growth, combined with concerns over the payback on its huge investments, could create a challenging scenario. For a deeper dive into these risks, including the factors that could cause a severe downturn, we've captured a full downside scenario in our separate analysis: How Amazon Stock Falls By 50%? See, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful, of stocks. Consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: A New Vision For Money: Hoskinson Predicts Bitcoin Will Hit $10 Trillion

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Charles Hoskinson, a founder of Ethereum and the driving force behind Cardano, laid out a sweeping forecast for crypto markets and payments this week. He predicted Bitcoin could reach $250,000 in the current market cycle and said the token’s total market value might hit $10 trillion in the next five years. Reports have disclosed that he links that outlook to new US stablecoin rules and what he calls clearer market structure. In an interview on the David Lin Report, Hoskinson argued that Bitcoin’s design made it strong as a store of value but limited as a global payments rail. He pointed to the old “big block” debates that pushed the network toward saving rather than everyday payments. Layer Two solutions, he said, are where Bitcoin gains the speed and lower cost needed for daily use. This framing leaves room for other blockchains to offer broader financial services. Hoskinson framed Cardano as an alternative path — one built on research and formal methods rather than rapid experimentation. Based on reports, the network has operated continuously for about eight years and uses a proof-of-stake model that many users back. Reports also state that over 70% of ADA in circulation has been staked by holders who support the network. That figure is commonly cited when comparing Cardano’s staking take-up to other blockchains. Stablecoins are central to Hoskinson’s case. He told lawmakers and audiences that tokens tied to fiat could give people in countries with weak local currencies access to dollar-like stability. According to White House materials, the GENIUS Act has moved through the political process and was signed into law by US President Donald Trump, creating a new US framework for stablecoins. Based on data, the stablecoin market has topped $250 billion in supply, a milestone that regulators and banks are watching closely. Hoskinson was blunt about exchanges and the stock market. He called current exchange practices “preposterous” and criticized systems that rely on centralized trust, including large listing fees and gatekeeping by a few firms. He said decentralized exchanges — where the protocol enforces rules — could cut out those middlemen and give people more control over their assets. That pitch fits a wider industry argument for moving custody and trade settlement onto public blockchains. For Hoskinson, Bitcoin will stay digital gold, while stablecoins, tokenized assets, and decentralized systems grow around it. The real question, he suggests, is not only how high Bitcoin’s price can go, but how the movement of money will be reshaped. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Dell Technologies (DELL) shares sank in early trading Friday, a day after it projected soft current-quarter profit. The Round Rock, Texas-based maker of personal computers and servers sees third-quarter adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.45 at the midpoint, below the $2.49 expected by analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. Dell shares are falling around 10% in early trading Friday, leading declines on the S&P 500. They are up around 5% so far this year. Dell's forecasts for Q3 revenue and full-year profit and revenue came in above Visible Alpha consensus. Its second-quarter adjusted EPS of $2.32 on revenue that surged 19% year-over-year to a record $29.78 billion also topped estimates, which the company attributed to strong AI demand. "We've now shipped $10 billion of AI solutions in the first half of FY26, surpassing all shipments in FY25. This helped deliver another record revenue quarter in our Servers and Networking business, which grew 69%," COO Jeff Clarke said. "Demand for our AI solutions continues to be exceptional, and we're raising our AI server shipment guidance for FY26 to $20 billion" from $15 billion-plus. Citi analysts said in a note Friday that Dell's Q2 PC segment sales were below consensus forecasts "by 3% or roughly $357.0 million," and that it "likely lost share in PCs." It added that the increase in its AI server shipment guidance is good news for Nvidia (NVDA), which makes up 88% of its sales, and Micron Technology (MU), at 17%. "Dell expects the traditional server business to grow in the 2nd half but below their prior expectations from the beginning of the year," the analysts wrote. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.

Second question: does the “supposed” Cartel de los Soles actually exist? Before we get to the meat of this article, which is really two articles in one, a quick recap (just in case some readers have been on a news-fast for the past three weeks). A few months ago, the US government designated the “SUPPOSED” (more on that later) “Cartel de los Soles” as a terrorist organisation, of which Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is its alleged leader — alleged as in according to the US government. In early August, the Trump Administration offered a $50 million reward, up from $25 million, for information leading to the arrest of President Nicolás Maduro, accusing Venezuela of being a “narco state.” Shortly thereafter, the US announced the deployment of a missile cruiser, a submarine, and three amphibious ships carrying 4,500 troops to the Caribbean, under the pretext of intercepting drug trafficking networks. There is no open talk of regime change though that is clearly the goal, as we noted in our post last Friday on the real reasons behind Washington’s latest show of force against Venezuela: Anyone who believes or supports this latest pretext for war against a country the US has tried to regime change at least twice so far this century and which has been subject to more than a decade of crippling US sanctions is either exceptionally gullible or an apologist for empire. The most important reason, of course, is oil. As the Mexican-Lebanese geopolitical analyst Alfredo Jalife says, Venezuela, once the “ranchito” of the Rockefeller family, is written with a capital “P” for “petroleo”. Indeed, even as Trump has ratcheted tensions with Venezuela, Chevron is still pumping out Venezuelan oil and shipping it back to the US. Other possible reasons include Venezuela’s close ties to China, Russia and Iran, the US’ three most important strategic rivals. As we noted in that post, the build-up of troops could also be part of a diversionary tactic as the Trump administration continues to reel from the Epstein scandal. This being Trump, it could also be just pure bluff or bluster. But it could also be the beginnings of something far more serious: another US-led military disaster. In recent days, the Venezuelan government has mobilised no fewer than four million army reservists to defend “la patria“. Venezuelan Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino López announced plans to reinforce the country’s anti-narcotics efforts through the deployment of military vessels and 15,000 troops to patrol the country’s “territorial waters.” President Maduro said on Monday that all branches of Venezuela’s armed forces were prepared to defend the country. Thousands of civilians joined a voluntary militia enrolment drive in public squares over the past weekend. At the international level, Venezuela’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations called on member states to demand an end to the US’ “hostile actions”. Some countries in the region, including Colombia, Mexico, Brazil and Bolivia, have expressed alarm about the US’ deployment of so much naval hardware so close to Venezuelan waters. Russia, China and Iran have also voiced their support for Maduro in recent days. China is estimated to have poured around $67 billion into Venezuela since 2007 and has a keen interest in the country’s oil supplies, whose exports have been severely curtailed by US sanctions. The 11 member nations of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA-TCP) unanimously condemned the US threat to regional stability. However, other governments in the region have sided with Washington and even offered up their land and waters for US troop movements. France Joins the Ruckus France has decided to join the ruckus by sending more ships to Guadeloupe, its overseas territory in the Caribbean. The Macron government claims its naval reinforcements are part of an international cooperation effort to regime change Venezuela against criminal networks in the area, and stressed the need to protect its overseas territories, in particular Guadeloupe and Martinique, which are often used as transit points for drug trafficking to Europe. The move comes, ironically, as fears of a French government collapse send its borrowing costs soaring. In fact, one thing that all three of Europe’s largest economies, Germany, the UK and France, have in common is their growing financial pains. Both France and the UK now have higher yields on their ten-year bonds than Spain and Greece, and their is even talk in both countries of the possible need for an IMF bailout. Meanwhile Germany’s Chancellor (and former BlackRock board member) Friedrich Merz has warned that Germany’s welfare state model is no longer sustainable. As Yves would say, quelle surprise! Something else that unites the three countries is their governments’ determination to expand their military spending, at US insistence, despite their rapidly deteriorating finances. While French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou plans to freeze welfare payments, reduce pensioners’ benefits and abolish two national holidays, the one area where spending will dramatically increase is the military. As the French government deplores the state of its finances at home, it is sending military vessels to the Caribbean to join the US’ latest act of imperial misadventure. Which invites the question: will other US client and vassal states in Europe and Latin America be doing the same in the coming days and weeks? Is the US trying to build a “coalition of the willing” against Venezuela, just as it did against Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya with such disastrous consequences? There are certainly moves in that direction. Trinidad and Tobago’s recently elected right-leaning government last week expressed its support for the US naval operation, noting that organized crime and drug trafficking pose a direct threat to the security of the entire Caribbean. Desperate to court favours in Washington, the government also offered up its waters and territory for US operations against Venezuela if Washington requests them — to defend neighbouring Guyana, of course. The Essequibo Border Dispute For its part, the Guyanese government has also called for the strengthening of cooperation against transnational organized crime and narco-terrorism, in direct reference to the criminal organisation Cartel of the Suns. The President of Guyana, Irfaan Ali, said last Saturday that his country is willing to take actions to defend its territory and sovereignty in the “new environment”. This is a reference to the escalating border dispute between Guyana (formerly British Guyana) and Venezuela over the Essequibo, a 160,000 square-kilometre oil-soaked territory that is on track to become Exxon Mobil’s largest single source of revenue by the end of this decade and which the US, unsurprisingly, would like to turn into a military outpost. For Guyana, the huge oil discoveries could end up being as much as curse as a blessing, as the NYT reported last year: The deal that made [Exxon’s success] ´possible — and which gave Exxon Mobil the bulk of the proceeds — has been a point of public outcry and even a lawsuit, with a seeming consensus that Guyana got the short end of the stick. But the deal has nonetheless generated $3.5 billion so far for the country, more money than it has ever seen, significantly more than it gained from conserving trees. It’s enough to chart a new destiny. But that new destiny has already included escalating tensions with its much larger neighbour, Venezuela, and risks turning Guyana into another disposable pawn in the furtherance of US geostrategic interests in its direct neighbourhood. As we warned in November 2023, this centuries-old dispute in an oil-rich corner of South America has the potential to become the next geopolitical flashpoint: Essequibo is not only rich in oil and gas; it boasts other mineral deposits, including Gold and Bauxite, as well as huge fish stocks and fresh water supplies, which a government minister even recently talked about exporting to other countries. As the Commander of US Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM), General Laura Richardson, said in January, Latin America is home to 31% of the world’s fresh water. But for the moment, it is Guyana’s vast untapped energy supplies that are of prime interest to US and global corporations. According to U.S. Geological Survey estimates, Guyana’s coastal area has roughly 13.6 billion barrels of oil reserves and 32 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves waiting to be drilled. For a country with one of the lowest population densities on the planet and a GDP of slightly less than $10 billion, a bonanza awaits. But Caracas contends that the untapped energy supplies belong to Venezuela and that the arbitration panel that granted Guyana jurisdiction over Essequibo was rigged. A Meagre Coalition So Far So far, four countries in the region have designated the Cartel de los Soles as a terrorist organisation: the United States, Ecuador, Paraguay and Argentina. My guess is that Peru will be next in line. Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado, has already said that she has “not the slightest doubt” that Peru, like other countries in the region, will join this latest US-led charge against the Maduro government. However, as coalitions go, this one is pretty meagre. One country that is missing is Colombia, which has played a key role in previous regime change attempts, including Juan Guaidó’s risible coup attempt in 2019. However, since the election of left-leaning Gustavo Petro as president in 2022, Colombia has tried to replace its alignment with the US with multilateral relations, even going so far as to join the BRICS’ New Development Bank and China’s Belt and Road Initiative. When Petro took the reins as president, diplomatic ties between Colombia and Venezuela were essentially on hold. Since then relations have gradually been re-established. In recent months Petro has even proposed building a confederation of nations with neighbouring countries (Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama) based on the former Greater Colombia that existed between 1819 and 1931 and comprised the four aforementioned countries. It will be very interesting to see how Colombia responds to developments in Venezuela. A few days ago, Maduro announced the movement of 15,000 troops to Venezuela’s border with Colombia earlier this week. Then yesterday (Aug 28), Gustavo Petro announced the movement of 25,000 Colombian troops to the other side of that border, which has been greeted positively by the Maduro government. This border region has long been a focal point of violent clashes between government forces (on both sides), insurgency and paramilitary groups. Lest we forget, Colombia is trying to put behind it 52 years of civil war. However, political violence is once again rearing its ugly head. A few weeks ago, the opposition politician Miguel Uribe finally succumbed to the injuries he sustained in an assassination attempt in mid-June. In addition, a car bomb was recently set off next to a military base in Cali and a police helicopter downed in the town of Amalfi. In total, 19 people were killed and 65 injured in the two attacks. The car bomb explosion in Cali has been described by local media as the “worst terrorist attack” in the country since 2019, when ELN guerrillas staged a car bomb attack against the General Santander police school, in the south of Bogotá, leaving 21 dead. Both attacks were attributed to dissident factions of the now-extinct Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. President Petro described what happened as “a day of death.” One can imagine Petro spending much of his time looking over his shoulder. Colombia is home to at least seven US military bases, and was until recently considered by many, including Hugo Chávez, as the Israel of Latin America. But Petro has tried to change that — first, by building alliances with other Global South countries, and second, by severing ties with Israel over its genocide in Gaza. In the process, he will have made lots of enemies, at home and abroad. In July, audio recordings were released in which Petro’s former Foreign Minister Álvaro Leyva could be heard talking about organising a coup against the Petro government. Israel is also stirring the pot, as the veteran journalist Gonzalo Guillén warned in a tweet yesterday, Benjamin Netanyahu’s regime and the far right in general are promoting an irresponsible and fallacious narrative: that Hezbollah terrorism is hiding on the border between Colombia and Venezuela. This claim, besides being completely unsubstsantiated and absurd, clearly aims to ignite the region and destabilise both countries. This accusation is entirely baseless and has serious geopolitical implications. They seek to generate chaos, confrontation, and destruction. Does the Cartel de los Soles Actually Exist? This is a question NC reader Veronius asked in a comment to our previous post on Venezuela. According to Gustavo Petro, the answer is a definitive “no”. “It is the fictitious excuse used by the far right to overthrow governments that do not obey them,” Petro wrote on X earlier this week. In so doing, he opened up an intriguing can of worms. According to US government agencies, there is more than sufficient evidence tying senior Venezuelan army commanders and senior members of the Maduro government to drug trafficking. But not everyone agrees. Even the former Venezuelan presidential candidate Enrique Capriles, who is certainly no friend of the Maduro government, has said in an interview with CNN (see below) that the US government needs to back up its claims with evidence. We, Venezuelans, don’t know who is part of the Cartel de los Soles. I don’t have any information on that. I can’t provide it and I think the United States needs to present the evidence. Such a serious accusation requires putting the proof on the table. Who are the members of the Cartel de los Soles? Who runs it, where does it operate? But not just in rhetoric, show the evidence. La extrema derecha venezolana desplegó una campaña de acoso y derribo contra Henrique Capriles porque pide algo de sentido común: mostrar las pruebas de ese supuesto Cartel de los Soles, quiénes operan y dónde. "De una acusación tan grave, hay que poner las pruebas sobre la mesa" https://t.co/NzSUUezGiA — Karen Méndez (@Karenmendezl) August 29, 2025 If the Cartel de los Soles does indeed exist, one thing is clear: it is not nearly as big a player in the global drugs trade as the Trump administration is making out — and certainly not as big a player as the US government itself. As we noted in our previous post, the US is arguably the largest enabler of drug trafficking organisations on the planet: [This it does] while waging a Global War on Drugs, just as it has been arguably the largest supporter of Islamist terrorist organisations while waging a Global War on Terror. Both types of organisations have proven to be useful allies in the pursuance of US imperial ambitions (e.g. the Colombian and Mexican cartels during Nicaragua’s Contra insurgency in the 1980s, or the Al Qaeda offshoots in Syria) while also serving as handy pretexts for military intervention. It has already been called “the most successful counter-narcotics effort in human history.” Armed with little more than sticks, teams of counter-narcotics brigades travel the country, doing something the US military never could, cutting down Afghanistan’s poppy fields. pic.twitter.com/LcAFqA317a — MintPress News (@MintPressNews) August 7, 2023 According to the official narrative, shaped over the past decade by US government agencies and Western media, the Cartel de los Soles is a loose-knit network of Venezuelan generals and politicians that are involved in drug trafficking, in alliance with Colombian and Mexican cartels. The organisation came into existence some time in the ’90s when army officials began taking kickbacks from Colombian cartels. The name “Cartel of Suns” allegedly comes from the emblems that looked like suns on the generals’ uniforms. To date, the US has prosecuted two Venezuelan generals on charges related to drug trafficking. In the most recent case, Hugo “El Pollo” Carvajal, the former head of military intelligence in Venezuela during Hugo Chávez’s government, last month pled guilty to trafficking cocaine to the US in a narcoterrorism conspiracy. As the journalist Antonio Maria Delgado reported in the Miami Herald, Carvajal also claims to have evidence about Venezuela’s involvement with Iran and Colombia’s FARC, espionage within the US, and Maduro’s ties with the Tren de Aragua gang, which serves as a “paramilitary arm of the state” and which has also been designated by the US as a terrorist organisation. However, Delgado notes, “Carvajal has a history of shifting loyalties and politically motivated statements”. Of course, the idea of army generals taking kickbacks from drug trafficking organisations is totally believable. It happens all over the world. Whether in Mexico, Afghanistan, Myanmar or Colombia, wherever large volumes of drugs are being cultivated, processed, or distributed, rest assured that some (often senior) army officers are getting a cut of the action for looking the other way, or even for helping with the distribution. A perfect case in point: “Tim told me about basically a gang … a drug-trafficking organization within the military,” made up of “an unspoken group of soldiers that policed themselves.” Inside Fort Bragg's Secret Cartel and Unsolved Murders: https://t.co/ZSgmHIFaZN https://t.co/Fqfqg9RZbq pic.twitter.com/HsspVifLCv — Rolling Stone (@RollingStone) July 28, 2025 As Venezuela Analysis notes, reports from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) itself state that less than 10% of US-bound cocaine flowed through Venezuela and the Eastern Caribbean corridor: A 2020 document from the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) by Venezuelan government critics Geoff Ramsey and David Smilde concluded that the country “is not a primary transit country for US-bound cocaine” and that the bulk of drug shipments reach US territory via Washington-allied countries in Central America. In more recent years, Ecuador has become a major transit point for cocaine, with some reports suggesting that as much as 70% of the global cocaine supply passes through the country. Curiously, the Cartel de los Soles does not merit a single mention in the DEA’s National Drug Threat Assessment from last year. Nor is it mentioned in previous editions I’ve checked. Even in the 2025 edition, which was written under the Trump administration, “Cartel de los Soles” does not appear once. If the organisation is such a threat, why doesn’t it feature once in the DEA’s threat assessment? The European Drug Report 2025, based on real data and not on geopolitical interests, does not mention Venezuela once as an international drug trafficking route. Even more damning is an article by Pino Arlacci, the former Director of UNODC, the UN agency on drugs and crime. Here is a brief excerpt, though the article is well worth reading in its entirety (if you don’t speak Spanish, use a machine translator): During my tenure as Director of UNODC, the UN agency on drugs and crime, I was in Colombia, Bolivia, Peru and Brazil, but I never visited Venezuela. There was simply no need. The Venezuelan government’s cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking was one of the best in South America; it can be compared only to Cuba’s impeccable record. This fact, in Trump’s delusional narrative of “Venezuela as a narco-state,” sounds like a geopolitically motivated slander. But the data, published in the 2025 World Drug Report of the organization I had the honor of leading, tell an opposite story to the one spread by the Trump administration. A story that dismantles piece by piece the geopolitical framework built around the “Cartel of the Suns”, an entity as legendary as the Loch Ness Monster, but apt to justify sanctions, embargoes and threats of military intervention against a country that, coincidentally, is located on one of the largest oil reserves on the planet… The “Cartel of the Suns” is a creation of Trump’s imagination. It is supposedly led by the president of Venezuela, but it is not mentioned in the report of the world’s main anti-drug agency, nor in the documents of any European agency or almost any other anti-crime agency in the world. Not even a footnote. A deafening silence, which should make anyone who even has a minimum of critical thinking reflect. How can such a powerful criminal organization, deserving of a $50 million bounty, be completely ignored by those working in the anti-drug field?… While Washington is stirring up the issue of Venezuela, the real centers of drug trafficking prosper almost undisturbed. In Ecuador, for example, 57% of the containers of bananas that leave Guayaquil arrive in Belgium loaded with cocaine. European authorities seized 13 tons of cocaine from a Spanish ship coming from Ecuadorian ports, controlled by companies protected by Ecuadorian government officials. The European Union produced a detailed report on the ports of Guayaquil, which describes how “Colombian, Mexican and Albanian mafias operate extensively in Ecuador.” The homicide rate in this country has skyrocketed from 7.8 per 100 thousand inhabitants in 2020 to 45.7 in 2023. But little is said about it. Perhaps because Ecuador produces only 0.5% of the world’s oil and because its government does not have a bad habit of challenging US dominance in Latin America? Lastly, something else that caught my eye during my research for this article was Wikipedia’s Spanish-language page on the Cartel de los Soles. On Google Search, the blurb below the title, which should match the first line or two of text on the corresponding Wikipedia page, reads as follows, or at least did so yesterday (translation and emphasis my own): The Cartel de los Soles is a supposed criminal and terrorist organisation led, according to the President of the United States, by senior military officers… In other words, even Wikipedia was still expressing doubts about its existence until a couple of days ago, and the claim that the “supposed” cartel is led by Venezuelan senior military officers is sourced directly from the US government. However, if you click on the link, here’s what you now see: Translation (emphasis my own): The Cartel of the Suns is an illicit, criminal, and terrorist organization headed by high-ranking members of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces since the 1990s, according to some media outlets,[1] whose objective is primarily cocaine trafficking,[2] fuel smuggling,[3][4] control of illegal mining activity in several states of Venezuela, with direct participation in the extraction and smuggling of gold, coltan, precious stones and other minerals. [5] In other words, not only has the qualifier “supposed” been edited out of the text, expelling all doubt from readers’ minds, but also the reference to the president of the United States as the primary source for the claim that the “supposed” cartel is led by senior military commanders of Venezuela’s armed forces. In its place as the new source for this information is “some media outlets”. And just like that, with a couple of minor tweaks to the text, all doubt is removed from the reader’s unsuspecting mind. And that, it seems, is one way that consent for US military operations is manufactured in today’s digital world. ‘The coalition of the willing’ is to normalize the militarism of the west (just as ‘weaponize’ is lazy semantics for propaganda). There is not ‘coalition of the willing’, there is only a groups of far right militarist western governments that seek global domination. There is no ‘willing’ population for these wars (if there were, then where are the lines for military recruitment?) . Do not join in the marketing jingoism of the imperialists do attack them, it is important to deconstruct their language, to show that not only their arguments but the foundations of its construct are erroneous You raise a fair point, haradan, and it is one that I will certainly keep in mind for the future. Unfortunately, because the expression in question is in the title of the post, it’s too late to change it. No, using the term, “coalition of the willing” is a fun euphemism that recalls the US government’s manufacture of consent in the run up to the Iraq war. For anyone older than 30 who remembers that episode, it was a real demonstration of just how many countries’ governments can be called upon to support a war that’s cooked up from scratch. The power of the internet allows us to catalog elite crimes and their methods to engineer conflict. We know how they did it decades ago, and they’re following the same template. There maybe is not a coalition of the willing population, but there sure is a coalition of the willing governments. They are willing, and eager, though maybe lacking on the ‘able’. Has the CIA been messing with Wikipedia again? Nostalgia fans will remember when Reagan claimed he supported the Contras to keep Nicaragua from attacking our southern border. Before that Adolf kicked off WW2 in response to Polish aggression. As Jean Renoir says in Rules of the Game, “everybody has their reasons.” Still if regime change in Venezuela is in the cards who will do the invading? Unlike Kissinger’s Chile coup the army there seems to be on Maduro’s side. Perhaps it’s all simply a plan to give General Laura and her minions something to do. In a recent Nima talk Richard Wolff suggests that ever since the Great Depression the US economy has run on military Keynsianism. Are Macron and the Euros out to do the same? Somebody hold him back. Perhaps the whole point of this operation was a sort of litmus test while Trump is trying to make himself appear tough in front of his base. It is to gauge how much support there would be for a future move on Venezuela. Thing is, by the time one is organized France may be under IMF restrictions so could not help out much. Some of those US allies/vassals in South America may want to help but Venezuela has a lot of people running around with guns and you would not want to be a foreign force stuck in that country. The US has the missiles to hit Venezuela but not the troops to occupy the country. So perhaps it was also a test of how many people in Venezuela would support a colour revolution. Not a lot by the look of it. If Trump was smart he could make a deal with Venezuela for good terms in buying their oil and boast of it but I do not think that the neocons like Rubio will let him. But then again if Trump was smart he wouldn’t be Trump. “But then again if Trump was smart he wouldn’t be Trump.” Thanks for that, Rev. Isn’t the US government sufficiently preoccupied with a very large war and a genocide already? (Not to mention the ever-dreamt about war against China). They also got the boot from the Red Sea by the Yemenis. Why should anyone expect more success against Venezuela? Real empire collapse times going on. If they do in fact try this outlandish idea, I wonder how the public will like seeing US troops returning in coffins, as during Vietnam times. Will the government double down and start a war with Mexico in order to distract from a Venezuelan debacle? At that rate, it’ll eventually have to be at war against the entire planet. The US will not be sending 4,000 troops into battle in Venezuela. It would be a massacre. As mentioned in my previous post, if this does kick off (still a reasonably large “IF”), the US will be waging hybrid warfare against Venezuela (cyberattacks, attacks on infrastructure, maybe even drone and missile attacks like in Iran) while hoping the locals do all the heavy lifting. The only ones occupying body bags and coffins, I imagine, will be Venezuelans and other South Americans. You’re probably right on that count (since time immemorial the ones to pay the price of the Monroe Doctrine have been the South and Central Americans, not US citizens); but given the tremendously self-destructive activity the US has been engaging on (the tariffs being the most egregious example), I’ve become quite unsure about US rationality. Maybe a waning power could be delusional enough to think a few thousand troops would somehow collapse the government. And yeah, if they do try it’s going to make the Bay of Pigs look good. Just spitballing here off of Nick’s comment above, but maybe the force that will fight the Venezuelans is meant to come from Colombia. It seems very odd to me that Colombia would amass military forces on the border with Venezuela and this would be described as a “show of support”. It also could be labeled as a possible invasion force. It’s also extremely odd that the president of Colombia would send a large number of troops to that border when it is currently being heavily attacked by FARC dissidents in the last couple of weeks. How would the military feel about having been attacked in country by their own drug cartels, that they are now being sent as defenders of Venezuela, which is accused of supporting drug cartels? (Not that I believe this propaganda at all, but of course some of the military in Colombia might.) How good is Petro’s relationship with his own military? The military was previously fighting the FARC, but under Petro the fight was dropped. The military must not be happy with this. Further spitballing, you say that Guyana used to be a British colony. British intelligence is famous for highly deceptive plots. That’s also throw in Israeli intelligence given their meddling in this affair, and we’ve also got the French on side. This plot could not only be seen as a way to attack Venezuela, but also as a way to destabilize Colombia and bring a military coup there. Now obviously these are just fever dreams I’m having, but I wanted to share them anyway, just in case others may contribute more info. As an aside, I am currently in Bogota again for the next week. Things seem peaceful and normal here from what I see in my very safe neighborhood. I will ask my host about this issue, he seems pretty well informed generally. saludos I was wondering if China’s investments in Venezuela have included some shore based anti-ship missiles? Wouldn’t surprise me. Russia’s definitely helping Venezuela to manufacture munitions. Iran has been helping them develop drones for over a decade. The Houthis showed that if you repeatedly launch missiles at US Navy vessels, their A/D rapidly depletes and they turn tail (I mean strategically retreat to reload) for the northern hemisphere. Not the big showy success Trump craves. And if Venezuela chooses (i.e., US missile damage to Venezuela is more than minor), a large drone (to deplete A/D) and missile wave will overwhelm the US (poorly performing) A/D, sinking thousands of sailors to Davy Jones’ Locker. My SWAG is that this possibility will underlie a TACO Tuesday. We might see a performative missile attack, ala Iran. Sending sailors to Davy Jones’ locker would be counterproductive, because it would be used as a discount 9/11 to manufacture consent for yet another war. Idiotic US population would fall far it, no doubt. I have already seen Alex Jones making a pro-war video. Since this is a family blog, I will restrain from commenting further on that, and leave this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77dDZOwt20E Venezuela just need to launch cheap drones in the general direction of US ships. No guidance or warheaed needed. US ships would have to shoot them, because they can’t gamble on which ones are potentially deadly, and which ones are not. After they shoot their wad, they will do Sir Robin maneuver, and bravely run away. Mauro Marcano, a journalist, was murdered for shedding light over the “Cartel de los soles” already back in 2004. Courts later sided with the drug lord who arranged his murder. https://rsf.org/en/victory-impunity-court-acquits-alleged-drug-baron-journalists-murder It is a shame that over 20 year later there still seem to be doubts about the Cartel’s existence. I think the point is that while there are certainly people in high places taking kickbacks from actual drug lords, this may not constitute a “cartel” by the normal definition of the word. I did check the link and I’m not all that familiar with Reporters Without Borders, but a glance at the home page indicates that they coincidentally have a lot of beefs with the very countries the US would like to regime change. Anybody else know more about this group? Another compromised NGO? Just because something existed 20 years ago does not mean it exists now. Given the US’ repeatedly proven propensity just to lie when it wants to and inability to provide evidence, my money is on it not existing; otherwise t would be splashed all over network news by now. FWIW, I’m currently reading Provoked by Scott Horton. While he clearly has an agenda, his references appear to be incredibly comprehensive. The book documents the absolutely vomit-inducing hypocrisy and mendacity of Washington over decades of war mongering, regime change, and war crimes. A distinctive element of the 2025 World Drug Report is its minimal mention of Venezuela, stating only a marginal fraction of Colombian drug production passes through the country to the Caribbean, US and Europe. The report from the highest global institution coordinating government drug policies makes no mention of the so-called Cartel of the Suns, which allegedly operates from Venezuela. For comparison, the European Drug Report 2025: Trends and Progress, published by the European Union, mentions no role for Venezuela as an international drug trafficking corridor. Though the European report states cocaine is the second most used drug in the EU’s 27 countries, Venezuela is unmentioned. Significant references appear for Colombia and Ecuador. https://orinocotribune.com/un-and-eu-confirm-venezuela-far-from-being-a-narco-country/ Well, the acquitted defendant, Garcia, was extradited from Trinidad to Venezuela and charged by the Venezuelan government. The murdered man had accused him of being the “head” of a cartel by that name, but I don’t see where he provided any evidence. In any case, Garcia seems to have had no government connections and the fact that he fled to Trinidad and was extradited suggests that he had no expectation of impunity. The cartel in this case, if it existed, would seem to have been a localised one, sharing nothing but maybe a name with the massive spectre supposedly headed by Maduro The global saber-rattling will ensure that more of all countries’ budgets go to military and surveillance spending rather than other needs for the people of various states. Everywhere one turns, there are military maneuvers. That is considered a win for those with infected with rabid neoliberal economic ideology. In addition to profits for the prison/detention industrial complex and redefining immigration statuses, the border lock-down frenzy is also happening in anticipation more conflict causing destabilization in all parts of the world. What’s more frightening than the usual strategy of “let’s find a country we can rape and steal its oil” is that the deep state and all the other nut-case neocons are thinking again in Zbigniew Brzezinski “Big Picture” terms, as “we may have to give up on the Eastern Hemishpere, so let’s really double down on controlling the other half of the planet.” Kind of like a new Monroe Doctrine. Russia, China and Iran have also voiced their support for Maduro in recent days. China is estimated to have poured around $67 billion into Venezuela since 2007 and has a keen interest in the country’s oil supplies, whose exports have been severely curtailed by US sanctions. I don’t understand why these countries can’t simply exchange oil for equipment and goods. Wouldn’t that allow them to bypass USA sanctions? Am I missing something? This kind of trade has been common for centuries.” I think you are misreading that. Venezuela has been badly hurt by US sanctions. There is no suggestion that China is bothered by some need to trade in US dollars. It may well be that you are correct and Venezuela and China are doing an oil for equipment swap while the USA grinds its teeth in fury. @nick Corbishley this YouTube video by “#RichardWolff” discusses the reasons why Venezuela is so important do the United States and China in terms of geopolitics. At least I think it’s Wolff, based on the title, the image and the voice. But there are no details that confirm it’s actually him. I remember seeing that @Richard Wolff reads this blog and comments occasionally, hopefully he will confirm or deny the veracity of this being him. At any rate though the analysis is very interesting. Completely ridiculous considering the well documented US involvement in the drug trade. Perhaps they will look in the mirror and demand to arrest themselves. Uribe next door had a long history with the cartels, and he was a big US favorite. There are plenty of real targets if they are interested. They used to talk about the oil. At least that was more honest. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * SUBSCRIPTIONS

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 29 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 29 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been.

And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber.

As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 29 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare.

Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: TSMC Stock: Wall Street’s Most Overlooked AI Play?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/29/tsmc-stock-wall-streets-most-overlooked-ai-play/
Time Published: 2025-08-29T10:00:51Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) has emerged as a notable beneficiary of the AI revolution. While TSMC serves as the backbone of the globe’s most sophisticated chip manufacturing supply chain, its stock has only risen about 18% year-to-date – significantly lower than U.S.-based chip companies like AMD stock (NASDAQ:AMD), which is up 38%, Nvidia stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) which has seen a 31% increase, and the struggling Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which has achieved a gain of nearly 20%. This relative underperformance becomes even more pronounced when considering the company’s robust growth outlook, increasing profit margins, and a valuation that is more attractive than that of most competitors. TSMC’s facilities are not merely production plants; they rank among the most strategically vital assets on Earth, producing the processors that power iPhones, electric vehicles, AI data centers, and nearly every cutting-edge device, allowing investors to actually hold a share of them. At current multiples, this segment of global infrastructure doesn’t appear excessively priced, either. The investment rationale for TSMC is grounded in its prominent position in advanced chip manufacturing. As the largest semiconductor foundry globally, it produces a significant portion of the world's most advanced chips. In Q2 2025, revenues surged 44% year-over-year to $30.07 billion, with high-performance computing accounting for 60% of the sales composition and smartphone chips contributing another 27%. In total, TSMC produces about two-thirds of the world’s semiconductors – and an even larger share of AI-optimized chips. This dominance stems from the company's leadership in advanced process technology. TSMC already commands the 3nm and 5nm nodes and is advancing into the 2nm "gate-all-around" technology this year, solidifying its leadership position. Advanced nodes (3nm, 5nm, 7nm) represent nearly 74% of TSMC’s production. In the AI sector, its standing is even more formidable. TSMC’s 3nm and upcoming 2nm nodes, together with cutting-edge packaging technologies crucial for AI accelerators, provide a technological advantage that competitors cannot replicate. Its enormous scale and unparalleled reliability have established it as the go-to provider for all significant AI chip manufacturers – from Nvidia and AMD to hyperscalers that design custom silicon. While companies like Intel have made strides toward more advanced nodes like the 18A process, they are usually far behind TSMC regarding yield rates and efficiency. The 2nm Race: Intel’s 18A Faces Uphill Task Against TSMC The growth prospects appear even more appealing. TSMC anticipates overall revenue growth of 30% in 2025, while its AI-centric business alone is predicted to grow at an annual rate of 40% in the foreseeable future, starting from its 2024 base. Industry projections estimate AI infrastructure spending to reach $6.7 trillion by 2030. With TSMC supplying the advanced chips that drive AI systems, the company has a lengthy growth trajectory ahead. Additionally, there are favorable policies at play. TSMC has received a reprieve from President Trump’s 100% chip tariffs as it has been expanding its operations in the U.S. New fabrication plants in the U.S. and Japan are also intended to reduce the geopolitical concentration risks associated with Taiwan. The company’s balance sheet is equally robust, featuring $86 billion in cash and marketable securities against approximately $29 billion in long-term debt. The margins further highlight the strength of the company’s business model. Gross margins hover around 59%, while operating margins climbed to nearly 50% in the last quarter – reflecting a solid 700 basis points increase from a year prior. This illustrates pricing power, efficiency, and its ability to outperform competitors like Intel and Samsung, who continue to face challenges with transitioning to next-generation nodes. Nonetheless, with a forward price-to-earnings multiple of roughly 24x, TSMC appears significantly less expensive than most U.S. chip design companies, especially given its unparalleled technology, scale, and structural exposure to AI. Given its strong growth, resilient margins, and a valuation that hasn’t yet aligned with its peers, TSMC could be one of the most overlooked opportunities to capitalize on the AI chip surge. It’s important to note, however, that no investment story is devoid of risks. The most apparent overhang is geopolitical: tensions between China and Taiwan cast a substantial shadow over TSMC’s global dominance. While overseas fabs alleviate concentration concerns, they also tend to increase costs. Another potential risk is disappointment in growth outside of AI. Apple, which stands as one of TSMC's largest clients, has encountered sluggish demand in recent quarters, and broader consumer electronics spending might impact non-AI segments adversely. The rising requirements for capital expenditure could also put pressure on free cash flow, even if margins remain strong. While TSMC stock may seem risky, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, has a history of significantly outperforming its benchmark that includes all three – the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. Why is this the case? As a collective, the stocks in the HQ Portfolio have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; they have provided a smoother investment experience, as evidenced by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Netflix Stock Worth The Risk At $1,200?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/29/netflix-stock-worth-the-risk-at-1200/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Netflix stock (NASDAQ: NFLX) has experienced significant growth, increasing by approximately 35% this year and over 70% in the last twelve months. The stock is now priced at over $1,200. This substantial rise follows two strategic decisions made by Netflix after the pandemic: enforcing restrictions on password sharing and introducing a more affordable, ad-supported tier. Both strategies have proven effective, enhancing subscriber numbers and providing a considerable revenue boost, with Q2 sales increasing by 16% compared to the previous year. Clearly, things have been going well. However, here lies the issue – these strategies are now being utilized in most markets, content expenses are rising, competitors are active, and the stock is currently valued for absolute success. When performance is so strong, it can be tempting for investors to assume that this momentum will continue indefinitely. This is precisely when potential risks are often overlooked. In 2024 alone, Netflix added more than 40 million subscribers, bringing its paid subscriber total to nearly 302 million, marking the largest annual growth in its history. The crackdown on password-sharing has encouraged users to either pay additional fees for extra access or enroll independently. Moreover, the ad-supported tier, which offers a more budget-friendly entry option, has experienced robust uptake, with more than half of new subscribers in eligible markets opting for this plan in the latest quarter. These changes have opened up new revenue avenues and reignited growth after a plateau following the pandemic. Nevertheless, there are growing concerns regarding future developments. With both strategies already in place in significant markets, maintaining the same rate of subscriber growth could be challenging. Additionally, Netflix has declared that it will cease reporting subscriber figures starting in 2025, signaling expectations for slower growth going forward. The competition is intensifying once again. Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, and Apple TV+ are reinforcing their focus on content and bundling initiatives. While Netflix’s extensive content library and scale still provide it an advantage, competitors are capitalizing on unique strengths. For example, Disney packages Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ together for as low as $17 per month, making the service more engaging and reducing subscriber turnover. Importantly, Disney can justify its substantial streaming investments because it profits from its intellectual property across parks, merchandise, and film releases. See How Disney Stock Can Surge To $230 Despite the surge in subscriber numbers, concerns regarding pricing, expenses, and broader economic conditions persist. Netflix has continuously raised subscription rates. Its premium plan now costs $25 per month, while the standard HD plan has increased by $2.50 to $18. While price increases may enhance margins in the short term, they also pose a risk of alienating cost-conscious users, particularly amid higher inflation and tariffs which could impact disposable income. Content costs represent another hurdle. Netflix has ventured into live sports broadcasting, including NFL games and WWE wrestling, which come with higher production and licensing expenses. Although margins improved in Q2, management has warned that operating margins could decline in the latter half of 2025 due to increased amortization and marketing expenses linked to its new offerings. Netflix is projected to spend over $20 billion yearly on content by 2026, an increase from approximately $17 billion in 2024. At its current valuation, Netflix trades at roughly 47 times the consensus earnings for 2025, compared to about 20 times in mid-2022. This premium valuation presumes that the company can maintain double-digit growth and margin expansion in the long term. However, consensus forecasts indicate revenue growth of only 15% to 13% for 2025 and 2026, which falls short of its historical growth rate. With increasing costs, slowing subscriber additions, and rising competition, Netflix may struggle to substantiate its current valuation. In contrast, Disney stock trades at approximately 20 times forward earnings with a market cap of $200 billion, while its direct-to-consumer segments generated $24.15 billion in revenue over the past 12 months compared to Netflix’s $41 billion. This suggests that Disney’s valuation may be underestimated given its strengths in streaming and highlights why Netflix’s inflated stock price might face downward pressure if growth slows. Worried about Netflix stock’s high valuation? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring 30 stocks, has a strong history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that?In aggregate, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded higher returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a more stable investment experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Crypto ETF market expands with 92 filings awaiting SEC decision

Time Published: 2025-08-29T08:03:22Z
Full Content:
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now faces one of its heaviest backlogs in the digital asset space, with at least 92 cryptocurrency exchange-traded product applications awaiting review. According to an expert, Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP) lead the wave of filings, each with multiple applications under consideration. The trend highlights growing institutional demand for altcoin exposure through regulated investment vehicles, even as the SEC continues to weigh its stance on crypto products. The pace of new filings has accelerated in recent months, suggesting the market is preparing for a broader expansion of crypto ETFs. Solana and XRP have emerged as the frontrunners among altcoins in ETF interest. Analyst James Seyffart reported that Solana currently has eight ETF applications pending, while XRP has seven. Both tokens rank among the most actively pursued crypto assets after Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Analyst Eric Balchunas noted on April 21 that 72 crypto-related ETFs were already awaiting SEC review at that time. With the figure now at 92, a further 20 applications have been added in just four months, pointing to rising momentum across the industry. The filings include proposals offering exposure not only to Solana and XRP but also to other altcoins, alongside three ETFs linked to Bitcoin and Ether. Two of the largest players in the digital asset space, Grayscale and 21Shares, are also part of the current SEC queue. Both are seeking approval for Ether staking ETFs. Earlier this month, the SEC clarified that some liquid staking activities fall outside its regulatory scope, a development that may impact how such filings are assessed. Grayscale is also pursuing a major conversion of five of its existing trusts into ETFs. These include three publicly traded funds and two private trusts, covering exposure to Litecoin, Solana, Dogecoin, XRP, and Avalanche. Such conversions would expand ETF access across a broader set of cryptocurrencies if approved. The potential impact of SEC decisions on altcoin markets remains a key focus for traders. Analysts at Bitfinex observed on Monday that a broader rally among altcoins is unlikely until more crypto ETFs gain approval. This view underscores the role regulatory clarity could play in shaping institutional and retail participation in the sector. Meanwhile, market commentators such as NovaDius Wealth Management president Nate Geraci have pointed to the sheer volume of filings as evidence of what they call “crypto ETF floodgates about to open soon”. While new applications continue to pile up, global asset manager BlackRock has already secured a commanding lead in the crypto ETF category. Its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) has attracted net inflows of $58.28 billion since launch. Its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has accumulated $13.12 billion in inflows, according to data from Farside Investors. BlackRock’s IBIT fund now holds more than 3% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. A Wednesday report also indicated that ETHA may soon surpass Coinbase as the largest single holder of Ether. Notably, IBIT now generates more annual fee revenue for BlackRock than its flagship S&P fund, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV). This is due to the fee structure, with IBIT carrying an expense ratio of 0.25%, compared to just 0.03% for IVV.

We're watching the systematic dismantling of human imagination, and we need to think about how to respond. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. As a journalist, I've had a lot of press releases and other communications lately about how AI is "democratising creativity". And I won't lie, I can see the logic in that. Most of us have found that tools ranging from ChatGPT to Adobe Firefly Boards have helped us out in some way or other (see here how AI is impacting graphic design). But there's a very big flipside to all of this. Let's not forget that, right now, the creative industries are having their guts ripped out by artificial intelligence. And the worst part? We're all just standing around watching it happen. To take just one example, WPP – yes, that WPP, the advertising behemoth that once symbolised British creative dominance – recently axed 7,000 jobs. Seven thousand. That's not downsizing; that's a creative apocalypse. But is this wise? To my mind, the advertising industry has always been built on a fundamental truth: humans buy from humans. We respond to stories, emotions, and that indefinable spark of creativity that makes us stop scrolling. And that can't be faked (as Will Smith just found out). Remember one of the best ads ever, that Cadbury gorilla drumming to Phil Collins? Pure human madness that somehow worked perfectly. Try explaining that brief to an algorithm. Yet here we are, reading Meta's Mark Zuckerberg promise in July that businesses won't need "any creative, any targeting, any measurement" because the AI software Meta is developing will handle everything. This isn't just happening in the advertising world, either. The tech industry has shed over 22,000 jobs in 2025, with a shocking 16,084 layoffs in February alone. Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta have all been slicing through workforces whilst simultaneously investing billions in the AI tech making jobs obsolete. Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. Meanwhile, the IMF predicts that AI will affect 40% of jobs and probably worsen inequality. Anecdotally, most freelancers have seen demand drop due to AI, including myself. Which is not surprising when illustrators, copywriters, designers and others, who've spent years honing their craft, are being told their skills are now available in a software package for $20 a month. Already dealing with late payments and low fees, freelancers now face competing with algorithms that don't need sleep, don't demand payment, and definitely don't complain about unreasonable deadlines. Tech companies love to frame this carnage as "democratisation." I think a better word, though, might be "homogenisation". When everyone has access to the same AI tools, trained on the same datasets, we don't get diversity – we get a creative monoculture. Yes AI can churn out perfectly adequate content at lightning speed. But in the process, it's creating a tsunami of forgettable mediocrity. Indeed, every time I look at Facebook ads these days, I feel like I'm drowning in AI-generated imagery that looks like it was designed by committee in a parallel universe where humans have never experienced joy; glossy, idealised, and slightly plasticky looking. So what do we do? Well, perhaps we stop pretending this is inevitable. After all, every AI implementation is a choice, every job cut is a decision. We can choose differently. Should creatives start to get militant? The Hollywood writers' strike showed that organised resistance works; they secured protections against AI replacement. Maybe artists, illustrators, designers, photographers and others need to fight to similar safeguards... before there's nothing left to protect. Because make no mistake: 2025 will be remembered as the year creativity went to war with artificial intelligence – and lost the first battle. We're not just losing jobs. We're losing the messy, unpredictable, gloriously human process of creation itself. Unless we act now, we'll be living in a world where creativity is just another task for machines to optimise.

The second-largest crypto is up more than 17% over the past 30 days compared to Bitcoin’s negative return of 5.5%, CoinGecko data shows. It follows a record setting run earlier this week, where Ethereum climbed to $4,945, its highest ever price, on Sunday. “Ethereum offers a dynamic growth story,” Xu Han, director of Liquid Fund at HashKey Capital, told Decrypt. He pointed to deflationary tokenomics post-Merge, scalability via Layer-2 adoption, and a yield-bearing staking model. On the last point, the amount of Ethereum that has been deployed for staking activity has continued to rise this year, reaching a record 35,750 ETH, or roughly $169 million, on August 2, according to data analytics platform Beaconchain. While that figure has effectively plateaued in recent weeks, structural advantages, combined with its role as the foundational layer for DeFi and tokenization, continue to attract institutional inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds, Han said. As of August, no U.S. Ethereum staking ETFs have been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, though some, including digital asset manager BlackRock, are hopeful that could soon change. Still, the attention remains fixed on the spot-based products, where Ethereum ETFs have staged a comeback after weathering outflows totaling $237.7 million from August 15 through to August 20. As of this week, Ethereum ETFs have garnered over $1.2 billion in inflows through Thursday, according to data from SoSoValue. Elsewhere in the market, Solana has begun to outpace its peers with a 7% gain noted since mid-August, coinciding with a 31% surge in Solana’s DEX volume to $5.10 billion over the past week, per DeFiLlama. Though it faces its own troubles with retail traders on Solana-based decentralized exchanges having pivoted away from speculative meme coin trading, leading to a crunch in the daily DEX trader count.

Former Labour leader Pat Rabbitte could be just the solution for party members to resolve differences concerning presidential election nomination One might think a small party like Labour could pull together. However, former leader Alan Kelly has caused quite a stir by saying he is opposed to its endorsement of Independent TD Catherine Connolly as a presidential election candidate. Mr Kelly has proved himself by surviving in the cockpit of North Tipperary in the last few elections. He is still well thought of in political circles, so his opposition is a blow to the party and leader Ivana Bacik. I may have a solution for Labour. Why not pull “a Rabbitte” out of the hat? The Labour Party should go cap in hand to Pat, another former leader, and beg him to be its candidate. I have always said he is the only credible Labour candidate for this election. He comes from the west of Ireland and has represented Dublin for many years and still has a profile. Thomas Garvey, Claremorris, Co Mayo An Israeli strike on a Gaza hospital that killed 20 people, mostly journal­ists and medics (‘Israel claims ‘double-tap’ strike on hospital that killed 20, including five journalists, targeted Hamas camera’, Irish Independent, August 26), has been justified by Israel because of a “surveillance camera”. Really? A camera? People who are starving, with little drinking water, no medicine and no hope of any shipments due to the Israeli control of aid and access are able to get high-tech equipment somehow and then decide to install it in their hospitals? Israel is so used to getting away with excuses that lack truth that it will tell the media just about anything. We could ask why it had to bomb the camera when there were journal­ists and medics responding to the first bomb. Why not take out the camera at 3am to minimise civilian casualties? Tom Harper, Blackrock, Co Dublin Israel continues its massacres in Gaza; Russia continues the slaughter in Ukraine. The international comm­unity and the UN have failed. Meanwhile, US president Donald Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize. Solution: President Trump stops all US support for Israel and maximises US support for Ukraine. The wars end. President Trump wins the Nobel Prize. The global economy improves. US businesses thrive. This makes America great again. Chris Fitzpatrick, Dublin 6 The recent meeting of Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky and other European leaders seems to have left us with more questions than answers. Trump indicated broadly that America would support the security of Ukraine. However, no specifics were given, as is the case with many of Trump’s statements. Apparently, land exchanges were part of the private discussions between the leaders. At this crucial juncture, it would be more beneficial for Ukraine to exchange land with the US as a pay-off for security now and into the future. After all, Trump is a transactional president, and it would also be in ­Europe’s interest in the longer term. Talks of bilateral and trilateral meetings, and the protracted nature of these, could well expose us to the volatile side of Trump and leave Ukraine totally exposed. Denis O Keeffe, Lisnagry, Co Limerick At a demonstration outside the Irish Central Bank this week, Dr Bridget Kiely called on Irish people to seek options to drugs made by Israeli firms (‘Hundreds rally against Central Bank role in Israeli “war bonds”’, Irish independent, August 27). The most famous of the Israeli drug firms is Teva. It has two facilities in Ireland that employ 650 highly skilled people. Its output is supplied to the HSE and also exported to 30 countries. Why should Irish jobs be put in jeopardy when, to end the war in Gaza, Hamas has only to release its Israeli hostages, disarm and disband? Karl Martin, Dublin 13 The Pope should go to Gaza. Until now, his approach has been entirely vocal and diplomatic – his actions have been limited to public statements, telegrams and high-level phone calls. The world’s collective conscience has finally awoken and public opinion has undergone a seismic shift, with people publicly demonstrating their horror and revulsion at the genocide in Gaza. A population is being annihilated, and this is why Pope Leo should go to Gaza. The Pope is in a unique position, invested with a universally recognised moral authority. Now is the time to eschew diplomacy for moral leadership. Action, not rhetoric, will honour Christ’s example. Eileen Seery, Gorey, Co Wexford It was heartbreaking to learn that on Wednesday, two children aged eight and 10 were killed and 17 other people were injured in a mass shooting at a Catholic school in Minneapolis. I get so angry when I hear how easy it is to obtain a gun in the US. In America, gun ownership is a widespread and complex issue, with a diverse range of perspectives. About 77 million adults own guns there, with self-protection being the main reason for having them. However, views on gun control and the role of firearms in society vary widely, even within different groups of gun owners. It’s when one hears of a tragedy, such as the one in Minneapolis, that one would hope the powers that be in the US might consider banning ownership of guns. If the American authorities ignore such a call, we will be hearing about more of these awful tragedies. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary With regard to the Leaving Cert, I read somewhere that 70pc of pupils negotiate maths very well. Alas, I am with the remaining 40pc.

Reliance AGM 2025: Reliance Industries’ AGMs have disappointed investors for four straight years, with shares slipping each time. Despite past hype around value-unlocking announcements, the 2024 meeting too failed to impress. Ahead of today’s AGM, expectations are muted, with brokerages suggesting this could finally leave room for a positive surprise if Mukesh Ambani delivers on growth cues across Jio, Retail, and New Energy.

Title: Nvidia Earnings Sustain the AI Stock Rally—Just Without Nvidia

Nvidia's earnings were great for AI stocks, just not Nvidia’s. “The overall strength of the July quarter results may offer some reassurance for investors after signs of stalling momentum for the large-cap tech rally,” wrote UBS analysts of Nvidia’s earnings in a note on Thursday. That was evident on Thursday. The S&P 500 hit a fresh record high, with some of the market’s favorite AI stocks among the strong performers, including Micron (MU), GE Vernova (GEV), Nvidia competitor Broadcom (AVGO), and nuclear power providers Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy (CEG). Major cloud providers Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG) and Oracle (ORCL) all rose more than 1%. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell nearly 1% after the AI chip giant reported earnings that beat estimates. The disconnect between Nvidia and the rest of the AI trade may boil down to expectations, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore. "For the stock to sell off slightly after hours on these types of numbers certainly indicates that sentiment has largely caught up to the growth potential," wrote Moore in a note on Thursday morning. "But outside of China geopolitics, this is a very clean beat and raise quarter," he added. Enthusiasm about artificial intelligence has been the driving force behind much of the stock market’s gains over the past three years. Tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon and Meta (META) have seen their sales, stocks and spending on AI infrastructure soar amid surging demand for AI products and services. But the rally has repeatedly hit bumps in the road, as it did last week when jitters about an AI bubble cropped up after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman questioned the AI rally’s sustainability and an MIT study found the vast majority of companies have seen no material return on their AI investments. Nvidia’s report on Wednesday, though, painted a picture of robust and growing AI demand. The company forecast sales would total about $54 billion in the third quarter, a more than $7 billion increase from Q2. That growth rate of about 15%—robust on a year-over-year basis, let alone quarter-over-quarter—doesn’t include any sales to China, which once accounted for about 20% of Nvidia’s data center revenue, according to Moore. Based on management’s commentary and Morgan Stanley’s market research, Nvidia’s growth forecast “represent[s] undershipment of true demand,” said Moore. He pointed to strong sales of Nvidia’s Hopper architecture, launched in 2022 and superseded by the Blackwell system last year, as evidence of unmet demand. “Compute shortages remain intense enough customers are still buying three year old Hoppers to serve some of that demand,” Moore said. There was additional evidence of strong AI demand in cloud data software provider Snowflake’s better-than-expected quarterly report on Wednesday. The results were driven by “strength in migrations,” according to Citi analysts, suggesting “large enterprises' increasing budget allocation towards database modernization as part of AI projects.” UBS analysts pointed to several other reasons, aside from AI hype, to be optimistic about the prospects for technology stocks this year. "Second-quarter earnings for big tech have been robust and broad-based, with most companies beating both sales and EPS estimates," the analysts wrote. They expect tech earnings to grow 15% this year, and hold in the low teens next year. Earnings should be boosted in the near term by U.S. dollar weakness. The U.S. dollar index has fallen about 10% since the start of the year, a decline that, by UBS estimates, should translate to a roughly 2.5% increase in the S&P 500's earnings. "We see more room for the US dollar to decline from current levels, with the Federal Reserve’s easing cycle set to kick off next month." High stock valuations have been a recurring source of anxiety for tech investors throughout the AI rally. "Valuations are currently at the upper end of historical ranges," the analysts note, but recent surveys of individual investors and assessments of institutional portfolios suggest there's room for the market to become even more bullish on mega-cap tech stocks.

August 28, 2025 17:15 ET | Source: Faruqi & Faruqi LLP Faruqi & Faruqi LLP Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP Securities Litigation Partner James (Josh) Wilson Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses Exceeding $100,000 In Novo To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you suffered losses exceeding $100,000 in Novo between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310). [You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Aug. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Novo Nordisk class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/NVO or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Major U.S. equities indexes rose as investors digested quarterly results from Nvidia (NVDA), the world's highest valued company, and a report showing a positive revision to gross domestic product growth in the second quarter. The S&P 500 advanced 0.3% on Thursday, securing a second straight all-time closing high and finishing a day above 6500 for the first time. The Dow gained 0.2%, joining the broader benchmark index in record closing territory, while the Nasdaq was up 0.5%, closing just below its record level. Nvidia, for its part, fell less than 1%. Read Investopedia's full daily markets coverage here. Datadog (DDOG) shares logged the S&P 500's top daily performance, jumping 7%. Thursday's surge for Datadog stock added to gains posted in the previous session following a strong earnings report from fellow database software specialist MongoDB (MDB). Datadog has launched several new products this year that leverage artificial intelligence technology to enhance its platform's database-monitoring capabilities, helping revenue growth. Shares of Fair Isaac (FICO), the data analytics company known for its consumer credit scores, advanced 6.1%. The stock has come under pressure in recent months following criticism of its pricing scheme by William Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who announced in July that mortgage lenders would be able to use FICO competitor VantageScore to evaluate the credit of potential borrowers. Some analysts have lately grown more positive on the shares, citing among other reasons its pricing strength for credit evaluations. Agilent Technologies (A) surpassed sales and profit expectations for its fiscal third quarter, and shares of the health sciences company gained 5.3%. The company also issued stronger-than-expected sales guidance for the current quarter, highlighting strong demand in its pharmaceutical end markets and its chemicals and advanced materials segment. Hormel Foods (HRL) shares plummeted 13%, falling the furthest of any S&P 500 stock. The maker of deli meats and parent company of brands including Spam and Skippy reported mixed results for its fiscal third quarter, topping revenue estimates but falling short of adjusted profit expectations. The company attributed its lackluster performance to increases in commodity input costs. Hormel expects this trend to continue in the current quarter and said it plans pricing action to address the inflationary pressure. Cooper Companies (COO) lowered its revenue guidance for fiscal 2025, citing soft demand for contact lenses, and shares of the medical device maker dropped nearly 13%. Cooper's revenue for the third quarter also missed analysts' forecasts, although adjusted profit came in slightly ahead of estimates. Citi analysts downgraded Cooper stock to "neutral" from "buy." Shares of Brown-Forman (BF.B) sank 4.9% after the alcoholic beverage maker reported lower-than-expected earnings per share for its fiscal first quarter. Although the Jack Daniel's parent slightly surpassed estimates with its top-line results for the period, boosted by demand for its ready-to-drink beverages, sales were down from a year ago. The company discussed consumer uncertainty amid the volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop, noting that the absence of U.S.-made spirits in most Canadian markets added to pressure on its international business.

Title: The AI bubble may be about to pop — here’s what MIT’s 95% failure stat means

The AI bubble might be closer to bursting than anyone wants to admit. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The AI market is undeniably booming. The six companies at the top of the world's valuation index, including NVIDIA, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Meta, are all deeply invested in AI in some form, and it seems like US stock markets are largely being held afloat by the unbelievable profits raked in by the firms. NVIDIA, the company supplying the world with an estimated 90% of the specialized GPUs required in AI data centers, recently became the first company to hit (and surpass) a $4 trillion market valuation. Microsoft also passed the $4 trillion valuation milestone roughly a week later, and it has invested a massive sum in OpenAI, its ChatGPT LLM, and Windows 11's Copilot AI assistant. Despite all of the promises and hypotheses from major AI players as to what their technology will unleash on the world, for good or for bad, tech trends and major studies have increasingly pointed to the AI boom being one massive bubble that will rival (or surpass) the dot-com era. A new report published by MIT's NANDA initiative — a program designed to help develop a "true internet of AI agents" — suggests that only about 5% of AI pilot programs actually make it beyond the incubation stage (via Fortune). A new report published by MIT's NANDA initiative suggests that only about 5% of AI pilot programs actually make it beyond the incubation stage. MIT's research involves surveys and interviews with hundreds of employees and heads of firms, as well as outside analysis of hundreds of AI pilot programs that may or may not have found success before completely stalling out. What are those other 95% of AI pilot programs doing to fail? MIT's report suggests that it's the enterprise sector and its inability to easily adapt to AI tools that's the issue, rather than a lack of quality in the offered AI models. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. As Fortune points out, resource misallocation is also a cause, with "more than half of generative AI budgets" being spent on marketing tools rather than what makes the most money — using AI to automate and streamline. MIT's paper arrives about a month after a report from Gartner predicted that "at least 30% of generative AI projects will be abandoned after proof of concept by the end of 2025." When nearly every AI pilot winds up a cautionary tale, the most exceptional successes now stand out, not because they cracked some secret algorithm, but because they treated AI like any other high-stakes investment. The 5% that succeed start with a problem worth solving. Successful companies are not after generative AI because it's trendy, but because they are chasing inefficiencies or opportunities with measurable upside. That means setting KPIs (key performance indicators) before a line of code is written and attaching those metrics directly to revenue, cost savings, or reduced risk. They also build for adoption, not just proof-of-concept glory. Good pilots are built to fit in with what already exists with as little friction as possible, and the step from "pilot" to "production" should feel effortless. Finally, they have champions at every level—from engineers who can iterate rapidly to executives who appreciate their strategic value and are willing to protect the project from short‑term budget cutbacks. That cross-functional alignment maintains momentum when early results are messy and is usually the difference between a pilot that scales and one that stalls. In short, the successful 5% aren't just lucky. They are disciplined, purposeful, and relentlessly focused on business outcomes. Following the release of the MIT NANDA paper, tech stocks in the US shed about $1 trillion worth of value over the course of four days. The main culprit? Overevaluation of AI companies that have no problem sucking up billions of dollars in investments, with meager results to show. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman — creator of the most popular AI model, ChatGPT — didn't help the situation. Five days earlier, The Verge interviewed Altman and quoted him as saying that AI is in a bubble. When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth. If you look at most of the bubbles in history, like the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important. The internet was a really big deal. People got overexcited. Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Altman's comments arrived following the disastrous rollout of OpenAI's latest model, GPT-5. GPT-5, which Altman hyped to incredible heights, was so bad that it forced OpenAI to resurrect older models, including GPT-4o. The catch? GPT-4o is no longer free, forcing users to pay a monthly subscription to return to what they viewed as the superior AI model. OpenAI's failure to live up to its GPT-5 promises didn't come out of nowhere. A report from 2024 suggested that OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic had hit a wall in terms of developing advanced AI models. Microsoft's founder, Bill Gates, predicted in 2023 that this type of plateau seen with GPT-5 would play out at some point. Consumer perception is not only a PR problem; it's a measure of survival. Now, AI is caught up in a hype wave that's half excitement, half suspicion. Each over‑promised rollout (hello there, GPT‑5) erodes public trust. When users feel like they're beta-testing half-baked technology, they're less likely to stick around — and less likely to rave about it within their companies or networks. Gary Marcus, a psychologist, cognitive scientist, and AI researcher who publishes the "Marcus on AI" Substack and newsletter — of which I've been an avid reader for the past 16 months — has also been sounding the AI bubble alarm for several years. A recent entry published August 20 from Marcus highlights the MIT NANDA study, stock market concerns, and the changing temperature surrounding AI firms and their promises. Marcus originally broached the AI bubble subject when OpenAI was still working with GPT-2, positing that the economics of AI simply don't make sense. As Marcus says, "But until recently enthusiasm kept rising and rising, no matter what I said." But then we all saw what happened with GPT-5; Altman spent years promising the moon, and in the end, long overdue, didn’t even come close to delivering. A lot of people took note. Leading figures in the AI world haven't been shy about laying out the destruction that AI will bring to white collar job sectors and even to humanity itself. And there's certainly the potential for this sort of dystopian future to arrive. But as I (and many others) have begun to suspect, these prosthelytizations could be more for the sake of bolstering hype and investments than accurate warnings of the future. AI has the potential to do great things, and I don't imagine it's going anywhere in the near future. But is there an inflating bubble that's threatening now more than ever to pop? Absolutely. What are your thoughts on the recent MIT study and the implications it has on the AI market? Is AI overhyped and in a massive bubble? Let me know in the comments section below!

Title: Bitcoin OG Who Told People To Buy BTC At $1 Reveals How High XRP Price Will Go

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The crypto market is paying close attention after one of the most famous early Bitcoin voices shared a bold view on XRP. Davinci Jeremie, who gained notoriety for advising people to buy Bitcoin at just $1 back in 2013, has now issued a strong forecast for XRP, noting that the token’s chart displays a healthy structure and a bullish pattern. In his detailed breakdown, Jeremie focused on XRP’s recent movements and the structure forming on its chart. He pointed to a clear W-shaped pattern as a bullish signal. According to him, the market action that pushed XRP higher in recent weeks appeared to be organic, with genuine investor activity providing support rather than artificial manipulation. Jeremie explained that he used the Fibonacci extension levels to calculate possible price targets for XRP. He said the 1.618 level comes in at 4,555 Chilean pesos, but he believes the token could go slightly higher. His projection puts the token at 4,761 pesos, which converts to about $4.93. If this outlook materializes, XRP would not only maintain its current momentum but also surpass its previous all-time high of $3.65, which it met in July of this year. According to the analyst, XRP’s earlier moves in late 2024 appeared forced, with extreme jumps that raised doubts, but this newest action looks more natural and could carry further implications. He emphasized that the chart math and price behavior support the path to further bullish growth, while the token’s structure itself demonstrates clear strength. What makes this analysis stand out even more is who it is coming from. Davinci Jeremie has long been regarded as a strong supporter of Bitcoin, often described as a Bitcoin maximalist. His early call for people to buy BTC when the price was at only $1 has given him lasting credibility in the cryptocurrency space. For that reason, his positive comments on XRP are being taken very seriously by many in the market. Jeremie emphasized that XRP’s moves from January to June formed a clean W formation on the weekly chart. He explained how the token reached a high of $ 3.40 in January, dropped to around $2.11 in April, rebounded to $2.60 in May, declined to near $2 in June, and then rallied strongly to surpass its January high. That sequence, he said, completed the pattern and opened the door for more gains. His change of tone shows that a strong market structure can override token bias. Even for someone who has close ties to Bitcoin, the health of XRP’s current chart was enough to spark a bullish outlook. Jeremie’s analysis suggests that more investors may start looking at XRP differently, seeing it as an asset with room to grow beyond old expectations.

Title: Bad AI Integration Has Consequences. How To Avoid Common Pitfalls

ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCIO, Forbes Staff. Bringing AI to your enterprise is an important step, but not doing it the right way can be costly. A new study from Infosys found that 95% of C-suite and director-level executives have had a negative experience with enterprise AI use in the last two years. These problems spanned a number of issues. About a third of all recipients reported they had experienced issues in each of these categories: privacy violations, systemic failures, inaccurate or harmful predictions, ethical violations, bias or discrimination, regulatory noncompliance or a lack of explainability. Of those who saw consequences from AI, 33% said the damage was substantial, while 39% classified it as severe—with a third of those saying the AI issues threatened their company’s existence. More than three quarters of companies negatively impacted by AI suffered financial losses, either through revenue lost or increased costs. This isn’t an indictment of AI as a technology, however. Infosys found that many of these companies had not yet laid the framework for responsible AI—determining rules and governance to ensure that AI is trustworthy, mitigates risk, protects data and functions with a degree of environmental sustainability. Fewer than 2% of the 1,500 companies Infosys surveyed for this report have a fully operational responsible AI framework, but the vast majority are starting on the path to develop these policies. In fact, 78% said they believe a responsible AI framework will increase business growth. More than four out of five said they believe regulations on AI would help them develop and further use the technology, bringing better clarity and confidence to AI compliance, with ethical and legal standards that will drive consumer trust. Creating workforce policies for responsible AI takes time and deep discussion, but it is possible. (And likely very necessary, since it does not look like there will be any widespread AI regulation in the U.S. in the near future.) Companies need to look at building trustworthy systems, which not only safeguard data, but also can explain their findings. Companies should also play an active role in observing what the AI systems are doing, and retooling the system when findings aren’t appropriate. They should consider things that might go wrong, and make sure the systems are secure and will perform accurately under these conditions. And they should ensure that they’re taking environmental sustainability into account. AI technology requires a lot of power, and as more entities embrace AI, energy demand will skyrocket. Energy efficient models will not only keep costs down, but minimize your carbon footprint. But as all tech leaders know, you don’t need AI for things to go wrong in an enterprise system. This summer, hacking network Scattered Spider has turned its attention to transportation, and has successfully disrupted flights and schedules for five airlines so far. I talked to Ian Ahl, CTO at identity security platform Permiso, about Scattered Spider, its tactics, and how you can prepare your company. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. The world’s most valuable company had two huge pieces of news this week. Nvidia released its new AI “robot brain,” the Jetson AGX Thor, and (again) broke a record with its most recent earnings report. Nvidia’s Jetson Thor platform for industrial AI delivers 7.5x better AI performance than its predecessor, the Jetson AGX Orin, and has about 3.5x better energy efficiency, writes Forbes senior contributor Janakiram MSV. He writes that the new platform brings real-time, intelligent interaction with the physical world to industrial robots. With the chip, factory robots could be able to perform several tasks at once, like visible product inspection and coordination with other robots. Forbes senior contributor Dave Altavilla runs down the tech specs of the new platform and its developer tools. He writes that the platform is not only top-of-the-line for robotics—it uses Nvidia’s Blackwell technology—but it’s also furthering Nvidia’s current strategic focus: owning the high-end performance market. The Jetson Thor platform didn’t figure into Nvidia’s latest earnings report, released after markets closed on Wednesday, but the company once again had a record-setting quarter. Revenues were $46.7 billion, surpassing its record of $44.1 billion in the previous quarter, and beating economists’ forecasts. The largest portion of its revenues came from data centers, which brought in $41.1 billion. However, analysts predicted this area would come in at $41.3 billion. The miss brought a slight drop to Nvidia’s stock on Thursday morning. President Donald Trump has inserted the White House and federal government into business in an unprecedented way. Last week, he brokered a deal for the U.S. to take a 10% stake in Intel. With this deal, the federal government will be the third-largest stakeholder in the publicly traded company, with its 10% share only behind a pair of 13% stakes held by Blackrock and Vanguard. Intel had been promised close to $11 billion to support its manufacturing facilities through former President Joe Biden’s CHIPS Act. The equity stake is being cast as a redirection of those funds. Intel, which was one of the world’s hottest companies during the PC boom in the ‘90s, has had a relatively slow spell, but it’s nowhere near the point of imminent collapse. CEO Lip-Bu Tan has been working to reinvigorate and refocus the chip maker since he took the helm in March, laying off employees, slowing down new facilities, and focusing on finding customers before increasing manufacturing capacity. Many policymakers and economists criticized Trump’s decision, saying it exposed the government to market risk, takes a step toward state-controlled industry and socialism, and is bringing unprecedented government intrusion into business. Trump dismissed those critics as “stupid,” and promised to make more deals like this one. He’s already inserted the federal government into the AI business, making a deal with Nvidia and AMD to pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from chip sales to China. The stock market has recently been on a tear, with the S&P 500’s total value up 84% in the last five years. But some wary investors are looking at the rapid rise and the big players, and envisioning a replay of the dotcom bubble a quarter century ago, writes Forbes’ Hank Tucker. Today, much like the late ‘90s, the IT sector makes up more than 33% of the S&P 500 index. And just like investors a quarter century ago bought up shares in internet companies, today’s investors are going all in on AI. Rob Arnott, founder and chairman of investment advisor Research Affiliates, told Tucker that today’s top companies tend to be great companies with great products, but bubbles burst when the margins are wrong—and they seem unrealistically optimistic around some of today’s high flyers. Last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told The Verge he thinks the AI market is in a bubble. Considering that Altman is one of the primary figures that started the boom, Forbes contributor Paulo Carvão writes, it’s worth heeding the warning. This summer, hacker group Scattered Spider has certainly helped make travel more difficult. After a warning from the FBI that they were likely to target airlines, Scattered Spider disrupted flights on five airlines in two months. Most of the attacks came as a result of deception, not sophisticated hacking, with hackers calling corporate help desks and impersonating actual employees, asking for—and getting—assistance in accessing those employees’ accounts. I talked to Ian Ahl, CTO at identity security platform Permiso Security, about Scattered Spider’s methods and how you can be ready for them on the cybersecurity front. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. What should companies do to protect against these kinds of attacks? Ahl: There’s back-to-basics things. Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication really helps out. But when they call the help desk and the help desk disables that, that control is gone now. You almost have to assume there’s going to be a way around MFA. Everyone put a lot of faith that MFA solves everything. It does help quite a bit, but it is not a silver bullet there. You need visibility. I think a lot of organizations are kind of still stuck on the inventory posture phase of identity. You need to know what actions are actually taking account. You’ve got to get to that runtime detection phase if you want to really do anything. And then your basics still matter. Least privilege is needed for some of these organizations. A bad guy is going to steal some data from Snowflake. Well, they’re clicking in with an account that hasn’t touched Snowflake in 12 months. Should that account have Snowflake access? Probably not. Make sure you have visibility across all your applications, to include SaaS, which is unfortunately the hardest part, but is where attackers are learning most before they take action in environment. What about the help desk issue? If somebody calls the help desk and falsely claims to be somebody high level on the IT team or the CFO, what can be done to better thwart these attacks? Identity verification programs are a must. You can’t just rely on small bits of information. The hard thing with the help desk is it just takes one person who is not great at their job for the attacker to get through. And when [hackers] are doing this, they’re not doing it for just one identity. They’re calling for dozens of identities—and they’re English speaking and confident, and have a little bit of information to validate that they are who they say they are. Unfortunately, you’ve just got to do more. You almost can’t blame the help desk, either. This is what they’re designed to do: to be helpful in these situations. But most organizations, after they’ve gone through this, we see them putting in strong identity verification programs with their help desk to combat this in the future. Some of my peers in the industry are reporting deepfake videos. I haven’t seen that yet from this group, but I have heard cloned voices from them. So when they’re impersonating the CFO, they sound like the CFO. It has to be more than, ‘I recognize this voice and it sounds like this person.’ How are most companies doing with these protocols to stop these attacks? That’s the thing that is most concerning about this group for me. By the time an organization realized what’s going on—which may be hours or even less from when the incident occurred— [the hackers] have moved so far, they've captured so many other credentials that it is really hard to stop them, especially when they go from cloud to on-prem. You reset their password here in cloud. The bad guy just reset their password. It gets synced right back up to the cloud. You’re in this weird game. Where before it could take a couple days for [hackers] to really gain their feet in an environment, it’s just a couple of hours now. And for organizations that are doing well with this, I would say even some of the more high profile attacks that you've read about recently, these organizations do very well. They found it very quickly. They called in the right people, but the bad guy just moved too fast. Faster than they could. It seems that hackers are always coming up with new techniques. How can a CIO, CTO or CISO be vigilant and ward off anything that may be coming now or in the future? I would say focus more on the tactics than on the groups. The groups are going to change, but these tactics remain relatively the same. You want to put up as many speed bumps as possible to slow these guys down along the way. Is phishing-resistant MFA going to stop them? No. But it gives you more opportunity to catch them along that path. Is doing least privilege across all your applications a solution? Now we’re going to start seeing some errors along the way. Unfortunately, convenience for your employees is also convenience for the attackers. Even things like Copilot—in recent attacks from this group, instead of searching, they’ve prompted Copilot to go search SharePoint for me to figure out how to use the VPN. So do we stop our employees from being able to use Copilot? Do we restrict what type of data Copilot can use? Put up as many speed bumps as possible along that path to slow them down, give you the opportunity to disrupt them before they make it too far. When Zscaler CEO Jay Chaudhry said that the company processes anonymized proprietary log data to train AI models on new threat signals, it started a new debate on what trust means in an AI-enabled cybersecurity world. Here’s some ways to look at and discuss the concept, both from the provider and customer standpoint. Companies can innovate on their own, but in today’s world with its modern tech challenges, some of the best new ideas come through companies working together. Here’s a toolkit to build and scale productive partnerships for innovation. A court filing last week said that Elon Musk tried to get another tech billionaire to join his unsolicited bid to buy OpenAI. Who was it? A. Jeff Bezos B. Sergey Brin C. Larry Ellison D. Mark Zuckerberg See if you got the answer right here.

Title: ROSEN, SKILLED INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages Novo Nordisk A/S Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action - NVO

August 28, 2025 13:17 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Aug. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Crypto Power Play: BlackRock Goes Big With Major Bitcoin And Ethereum Purchase

Full Content:
As the bull market cycle continues, Bitcoin and Ethereum adoption are sharply heating up among prominent figures and large corporations in the ever-evolving financial landscape. In the last few days, institutions have gone on a significant buying spree, one of which is the asset management firm BlackRock. Bitcoin’s price has steadily faced notable price fluctuations, while Ethereum’s price has experienced a pullback from its recent all-time high. Despite this bearish performance from BTC and ETH, BlackRock is purchasing the two crypto leaders on a massive scale. According to the reports, the world’s largest asset manager has acquired a staggering $750 million worth of BTC and ETH. It is worth noting that this massive accumulation by the leading firm was made within two days. The report reveals that BlackRock bought about 413 BTC valued at $46 million, along with 73,864 ETH for a staggering $342 million on August 27. Prior to this huge purchase, the asset manager made another acquisition of 568 BTC for approximately $62.6 million, and 65,901 ETH valued at $292.6 million. This rapid accumulation underscores the firm’s growing conviction in crypto as an institutional-grade asset class. While signaling rising demand among institutional investors, the huge purchase in such a short span reinforces the idea that traditional finance is sharply intertwining with the crypto sector. Combining these acquisitions, the asset manager invested close to $750 million in its cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) products within a two-day window. In 2025, these purchases rank among the biggest single-day purchases made by a conventional financial institution. Large Bitcoin and Ethereum holders, often regarded as whales, have been gradually returning to the market. Santiment, a leading market intelligence and on-chain platform, has reported an uptick in BTC and ETH whales even as bearish pressure intensifies. This growth is observed among wallet addresses holding 1,000 BTC and wallet addresses holding at least 10,000 ETH. Such a trend from high-net-worth investors signals a possible change in market dynamics for the two assets. Their comeback coincides with a critical juncture for the cryptocurrency industry as investors balance the long-term growth trajectory of the assets against macroeconomic uncertainty. Data from the leading on-chain platform shows that there are now 13 more wallets holding 1,000 BTC, bringing the total to 2,087 wallets. Meanwhile, for Ethereum, there is now a total of 1,275 wallets holding 10,000 ETH following an additional 48 new wallets. At the time of writing, BTC and ETH were trading at $113,182 and $4,573, respectively, in the last 24 hours. While ETH’s trading volume has declined by over 13% in the past day, BTC’s trading volume is experiencing a slight upswing of nearly 5%. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Dollar General Bets Big on Stores With Nearly 4,900 Projects in 2025

Highlights Dollar General posted net sales of $10.7 billion and net income of $411 million, beating expectations as value-driven shoppers turned to its stores amid inflationary pressures. The company plans nearly 4,900 real estate projects in fiscal 2025, including 575 new stores, 15 in Mexico, and over 4,200 remodels across its Elevate and Renovate initiatives. Dollar General paused expansion of its high-margin pOpshelf concept but continues investing in digital convenience, including expanded delivery and same-day service. Retail is being rewritten in real time as price-pressured shoppers chase value.

Δ Dollar General said during its Thursday (Aug. 28) second-quarter 2025 earnings call that its business model is finely tuned to these shifting consumer dynamics. “We are pleased with our strong second-quarter results, including earnings growth that significantly exceeded our expectations,” Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said in a Thursday press release. “Our improved execution, along with our progress advancing key initiatives, is resonating with both existing and new customers as we further enhance our value and convenience proposition.” For the 13 weeks ended Aug. 1, Dollar General reported net sales of $10.7 billion, a 5.1% increase from $10.2 billion in Q2 2024. Net income reached $411 million, up 10% from $374 million in Q2 2024. While traditionally serving lower-income households, Dollar General increasingly attracts middle- and high-income shoppers trading down amid rising costs and seeking bargain alternatives for routine needs. Read also: As Households Stretch Paychecks, Off-Price Retail Stretches Profits For fiscal 2025, the company expects approximately 4,885 real estate projects, including 575 new stores in the United States and up to 15 in Mexico, the release said. Nearly 4,250 remodels will be completed across the two major initiatives. This level of construction and remodeling is unmatched in the U.S. discount sector and reflects Dollar General’s conviction that small-box convenience remains a durable retail format even in an age of eCommerce and big-box consolidation. In the three-month period representing Q2, the company opened 204 new stores, remodeled 729 locations under “Project Elevate,” remodeled 592 more under “Project Renovate,” and relocated 15 stores, the release said. Projects Elevate and Renovate are not merely cosmetic. Elevate is designed as a partial remodel that refreshes merchandising, reduces maintenance costs and enhances customer experience. Renovate involves full remodels that upgrade layouts, product selections and equipment. Both are intended to improve the balance between the company’s low-margin, high-traffic consumable goods and its high-margin, non-consumable goods. See also: Discounts Lure High-Income Customers to Dollar Stores Dollar General’s management commentary on Thursday’s earnings call illustrated the precarious environment its shoppers face. The company’s core customers are disproportionately affected by inflation, higher rent and energy costs, and resumed student loan repayments. While food and household goods sales have held up, discretionary spending in seasonal, home and apparel categories remains pressured. The sales mix underscores this tension. Consumables accounted for more than 82% of sales in Q2, rising 5% year over year to $8.82 billion, per the press release. Seasonal and home products grew more modestly, while apparel posted only slight gains. The heavy weighting toward consumables secures traffic but dampens gross margin expansion. PYMNTS Intelligence’s July Paycheck-to-Paycheck research showed that 78% of low-income households, defined as those earning less than $50,000 a year, and 66% of middle-income households, defined as those earning between roughly $50,000 and $100,000 a year, said they were living paycheck to paycheck in June. Perhaps the most telling shift in strategy involves Popshelf, Dollar General’s relatively new retail concept aimed at high-margin categories like home décor, beauty and seasonal goods. Originally envisioned as a growth vector, pOpshelf has faced headwinds in the current environment. In Q2, the company operated 180 standalone locations, but it has paused new openings in 2025, Business Back reported Sunday (Aug. 24). Some Popshelf sites are being converted back to Dollar General stores. Despite its brick-and-mortar foundation, Dollar General continues to invest in digital channels. The company partnered with Uber Eats this month to deliver household essentials. In September 2024, it launched same-day home delivery via its own app and website in select markets. That service is rolling out more broadly in 2025, positioning Dollar General to compete for convenience with grocery delivery providers and Walmart’s expansive online network. Research by PYMNTS Intelligence has tracked the impact of tariffs on consumers throughout the spring and summer. For example, the June report, “Stock Out. The Impact of Tariffs on Consumer Product Prices and Availability,” showed 47% of U.S. shoppers said they could not find or afford everyday items because tariffs led to supply chain disruptions or higher price tags.

Title: Capcom Has Reportedly Tried And Failed To Remake Dino Crisis A Few Times

Black Myth WukongDino CrisisMorning Checkpoint Welcome back, gamers. I can call you that, right? Cool. Anyway, this is Morning Checkpoint, Kotaku’s daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about. Today, we have more layoffs, Unreal Engine 5 optimization information, details on how Black Myth: Wukong runs on Xbox, and someone claiming Capcom has tried to remake Dino Crisis a few times, but keeps failing. Oh, and congrats, internet, you bullied Cracker Barrel hard enough that it’s not changing its logo after all. Fans have been begging Capcom for a new Dino Crisis for many, many years, and it just hasn’t happened. Even when Capcom publishes a game with dinosaurs, it’s not actually the one fans really want. But it sounds like the lack of Dino Crisis isn’t because Capcom has given up on the series. According to reliable Capcom leaker Dusk Golem, Capcom has actually tried twice before to revive the dinosaur-themed horror franchise. The leaker claims that Capcom Vancouver, the studio that developed all of the Dead Rising sequels, was working on a remake of Dino Crisis before the studio was closed. Another version was apparently being worked on by an unnamed studio at a later date, but was canned because it “wasn’t turning out so good.” So Capcom is reportedly trying, but struggling, to make more Dino Crisis. Hopefully, in the same way Capcom got Resident Evil back on track with RE7, the publisher can get Dino Crisis going again. Here’s something odd: Black Myth: Wukong on Xbox Series X and Series S looks quite different from the PS5 version. According to a new analysis video from Digital Foundry, Wukong on Xbox can look extremely different due to the fact that the game doesn’t use frame-gen tech like the PS5 does in some modes. This can create a cleaner image. But it also lacks some of the fancier lighting techniques seen in the PS5 port, which can result in a drastically different image as well. The Xbox version also has other quirks that, in some modes, lead to a softer image. Yet the much weaker Series S appears to have rock-solid performance numbers. It’s an odd situation in 2025. These days, most games run and look about the same across the PS5 and Xbox. Not so with Black Myth: Wukong. On August 27, Crystal Dynamics, the studio currently working on the next Tomb Raider game for Amazon, announced another round of layoffs. The news came via a post on the company’s LinkedIn page, which didn’t specify how many people lost their jobs during this round of cuts. The studio says that “the future of Tomb Raider” is “unaffected by this decision.” This is the second round of layoffs to happen at Crystal Dynamics this year, coming after some employees were previously let go in March. âToday we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions. This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market,” the studio posted. There has been a lot of criticism aimed at video game development engine Unreal 5 over the last year or so, as some believe it isn’t optimized properly. Epic boss Tim Sweeney pushed back on these claims during an interview that happened at the recent Unreal Fest in South Korea. The boss blamed “order of development” for games running poorly on consoles and PC. âMany studios build for top-tier hardware first and leave optimization and low-spec testing for the end,” said Sweeney. “Ideally, optimization should begin earlyâbefore full content build-out. Weâre doing two things: strengthening engine support with more automated optimization across devices, and expanding developer education so âoptimize earlyâ becomes standard practice. If needed, our engineers can step in.” Wizards of the Coast president John Hight revealed, in an interview with GamesIndustry.biz, that a team of developers who were previously working on EA’s Black Panther game, which was canned earlier this year, have joined the company to work on a new project. The team of former Cliffhanger devs is led by creative director Michael de Plater, a veteran dev whose resume includes Shadow of Mordor and Rome: Total War.Â “We were actually able to bring [de Plater] and 14 key people that he’s worked with there â and many of them at Monolith â to incubate a new game for us,” Hight told the outlet. “He’ll be starting concept development on something very cool and new â and that part I can’t tell you yet.” If you have an hour or so to kill, watch this shockingly deep dive into M&M lore.

Title: Reilly embracing the competition to be Ireland's No 9

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist There's no position in the Ireland women’s team as hotly contested right now as scrum-half. Over the last 18 months, Scott Bemand has narrowed his selections down bit by bit to the point where there is no debate around his first choice in several positions. Niamh O’Dowd, Neve Jones and Linda Djougang are the locked-in front row for big games. Ruth Campbell, Sam Monaghan, Aoife Wafer, Dannah O’Brien, Aoife Dalton, Amee-Leigh Costigan and Stacey Flood also appear to be guaranteed their shirts if fit. At scrum-half, Aoibheann Reilly, Emily Lane and Molly Scuffil-McCabe have been rotating in and out. The margin between starting and missing out on the matchday 23 has been razor thin. Lane and Scuffil-McCabe shared the jersey during WXV1 campaign in Canada last year while Reilly was still on her way back from an ACL injury, with Scuffil-McCabe starting the win against New Zealand, before Lane got the nod in the games against Canada and USA. In the Six Nations, it looked as though Lane was top of the scrum-half rotation when she started the games against France and England, with Reilly (above) impressing in her chance in the 9 jersey away to Italy. Bemand continued to rotate, with Scuffil-McCabe brought into the starting side for the final two Six Nations outings, and she kept her place for the first World Cup warm-up against Scotland. For the visit of Canada, Reilly came back in, and she impressed again in Ireland's Pool C opener against Japan last week. Just as it seemed the 24-year-old had taken the jersey for herself, it now looks like another rotation is on the cards for Spain on Sunday. "That's what you want, you want competition in your squad," says Reilly, who started last week's win against the Sakura XV. "We always knew that the World Cup was coming up and it's only fair that everyone gets a chance and play with different combinations and see what works best for the team. "And we're blessed that we have depth there, because someone's game style might suit an opposition better than the other." A tally of the numbers sums up how unpredictable Bemand’s thinking has been around scrum-half. In the last 11 games, Lane is the only player to have featured in every game, but only four of those have been starts, and she hasn’t started since Round 3 of the Six Nations. Scuffil-McCabe (above) has played six times, with four of those from the start, while Reilly has started three of her five appearances. "We have depth there now, whereas maybe we didn't have it as much before," said Reilly. "And you're starting to see that not just at scrum-half, but other positions now, where other girls can put their hand up every week and there's constant competition there which is only driving us on as a squad." With Bemand and assistant coach Larissa Muldoon both former scrum-halves, Reilly says there is "constant feedback" to the trio of 9s. "It's definitely evolved me as a player and helped me see the game differently," she adds. "They both come and give different advice about different things but it's great to have the both of them, and they're all aligned with our style of play, which is great. "All of us are very different and we have different elements to our game so it's just really what suits the team at the weekend. We all compete really well together, so it's great that we're all there, pushing each other on. "I like playing with a fast-tempo game, lots of running lines. That’s probably the style I like most." Getting to a World Cup has been a milestone achievement for the Blackrock and Connacht scrum-half, given she has come back from two ACL injuries in recent seasons. Representing Ballinasloe is also a driving factor. One of three Ballinasloe RFC products in this Irish squad, Reilly has been playing with Béibhinn Parsons and Meabh Deely since she was a child. "It's unreal. It's hard to explain because it's all we've ever known," she said. "We were always on the same teams together but it's so cool to see how the town has gotten behind us. "There’s huge posters up around Ballinasloe of the three of us which is surreal, but, yeah, it's really special. "My family was over last weekend. I think they're going to all the games to support the girls and my brother came over from New York. "And it's actually his first time seeing me live so he's over for the month, which is great. "And then my other brother [Colm], he plays with Connacht so he's hoping to come for the New Zealand games. "He can't quite get it off training but it's great to have the support over. And there's so many Irish in the crowd last weekend, which was class." Listen to the RTÉ Rugby podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang advises AI customers to 'pace themselves' after GPU clusters sell out, but the company says it's going to continue to scale up

What am I humming? Bubble Pop by HyunA, for no particular reason. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Nvidia has been on a tear. Just in case you've been living under a nice mossy rock the past few years, the advent of generative AI has ushered in a golden era for the company. Let's talk some truly eye-watering facts and figures: during Nvidia's Q2 2025 earnings call, the company reported a total revenue of $46.7 billion. Okay, so it's more like a diamond-encrusted-with-foie-gras-on-the-side era, but it's been far from smooth sailing. As such, with the next-gen Rubin architecture just off the horizon and data centre demand continuing to grow, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said during the aforementioned earnings call, "We advise our partners, our customers to pace themselves." It's bizarre to hear the head of a company making bank say anything to the effect of 'actually, hold your horses,' but Huang advises that Nvidia's AI customers build "data centers on an annual rhythm." Why? There are more than a few potential reasons, ranging from the ever-changing tariff situation in the US, to potential strain on what may well be an AI bubble. But, specifically referring to Nvidia's H100 and H200 GPU clusters often used in AI data centres, Huang had this to say: "Right now, the buzz is — I'm sure all of you know about the buzz out there. The buzz is everything sold out." We've also seen stock supply issues on the gaming side. Early supplies of RTX 50-series GPU stock left much to be desired, making it an absolute mission to find a card at MSRP only a few months ago. Still, gaming alone raked in $4.3 billion for Nvidia, according to the Q2 2025 earnings call. Thankfully, it's a little easier to find a 50-series card at a reasonable price now, as our best graphics cards deals guide can attest. However, it's worth noting that Nvidia's AI revenue vastly overshadows even the billions made by its gaming division. As such, Huang kept these priorities in sight as he reassured investors that Nvidia was taking steps to avoid similar scarcity with Rubin later this year. In his closing remarks, Huang said, "Our next platform, Rubin, is already in fab. We have six new chips that represent the Rubin platform. They have all ticked up at TSMC. Rubin will be our third-generation NVLink rack scale AI supercomputer, and so we expect to have a much more mature and fully scaled up supply chain." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Given the constantly shifting US tariff situation and its far-reaching effects on the wider geopolitical stage, it's hard to comment on the projected success of even the best laid plans. And then there's the fact that major player Meta is actually looking to downsize its own AI division—could this herald the shape of things to come for AI's place within big tech? If Huang suspects as much, he didn't let on, instead saying, "Blackwell and Rubin AI factory platforms will be scaling into the $3 trillion to $4 trillion global AI factory build out through the end of the decade." 👉Check out our full guide👈 1.

Title: Layoffs are about to hit Martin Sorrell's S4 Capital advertising group
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/martin-sorrell-s4-capital-ad-group-monks-layoffs-imminent-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-28T14:33:20Z

Changes are afoot at advertising mogul Martin Sorrell's S4 Capital. On Thursday, Monks, S4 Capital's operating brand, informed staffers of a restructuring that includes layoffs, according to a screenshot of an internal presentation viewed by Business Insider. The slide detailed how employees whose roles could be affected would be informed this week. In the UK, if more than 20 employees are affected by a layoff in a 90-day period, the company is required to enter a collective consultation process with representatives for the employees. S4 is headquartered in the UK. The presentation said that the "reshaping of teams," including reporting lines, redeployment, and changes to roles or departments, would commence on September 5. "Managing our cost base effectively is a key priority in this environment and we have continued to work to streamline and integrate our businesses," an S4 spokesperson said in a statement. The company declined to comment on how many roles would be affected by the restructure. The layoffs come as advertising agencies face multiple challenges, with tough macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions making marketers cautious about their spending. At the same time, the rise of artificial intelligence has so far proven to be a double-edged sword — helping make agencies more productive and provide consulting services on how to use the technology, while also threatening to automate many of the services that were once outsourced to them. S4 launched in 2018 with a bang, just weeks after Sorrell's bitter exit from WPP, the firm he built over 33 years from a shell company that made shopping baskets to a $20 billion advertising juggernaut. Sorrell set out a vision for S4 to be everything WPP, in his view, was not. Smaller and more nimble, S4 would only focus on digital marketing and would be "faster, better, cheaper" than the incumbents, he said at the time. Sorrell repeated his WPP playbook of building the company through acquisitions — this time at warp speed. S4's fortunes took a turn in 2022. The group was a casualty of the "years of efficiency" undertaken by many Big Tech giants around that time. Tech companies make up a sizable chunk of S4's client portfolio. It also faced internal challenges, including underperformance at some of its agencies and an auditing issue that forced it to delay the release of its annual report that year. S4's market value plunged and has remained depressed, encouraging takeover sharks to circle in recent years. Earlier this month, S4 issued a statement to confirm a press report that it had entered early discussions with the private-equity-backed ad agency MSQ Partners about a possible merger between the two companies. MSQ Partners later issued a statement denying its involvement in those talks. The statement said that while there may have been informal discussions between its majority shareholder, One Equity Partners, and S4, it didn't plan to pursue further talks about a possible transaction. During S4's annual general meeting in June of this year, Sorrell said the agency's 2024 performance had been affected by challenging macroeconomic conditions, high interest rates, and technology clients prioritizing capital expenditure over operating expenditure, such as marketing, amid the AI race. Sorrell said S4 was anticipating better performance in the second half of 2025, having recently picked up new business from the likes of General Motors, Amazon, and T-Mobile. Still, S4 said it expected full-year net revenue to be down this year versus last. "The strategy of S4 Capital remains the same. Our four principles around digital only, data-driven 'faster, better, cheaper and more' or 'speed, quality, value and more' and a unitary structure all appeal strongly, even more so in challenging economic times," the S4 spokesperson's statement said. S4 has been working to improve its operating margins and reduce its net debt, in part by reducing staff through multiple layoffs in recent years. According to the company's latest regulatory statement, its head count has dropped to roughly 6,800 as of August 22, from around 9,000 at its largest. The company is due to release its interim financial results on September 15. Jump to

Title: Concerns Grow As Strategy Issues More Stocks To Buy Bitcoin

Strategy’s latest stock sale to buy more Bitcoin has put investor nerves on edge, as numbers and timing raise fresh doubts about shareholder dilution and the company’s funding choices. Based on reports, Strategy changed its public guidance on August 18 and then, within days, moved to issue a large amount of new stock. CryptoQuant analyst JA Maartunn traced the pattern: no fresh issuance on Aug. 3, roughly $18 million on Aug. 10, about $51 million on Aug. 17 — then close to $360 million raised in a single week after the guidance change. That sharp jump in new capital has drawn scrutiny from market watchers who worry the company is leaning on share issuance to keep buying Bitcoin. The new rules link stock sales to something called market net asset value, or mNAV, which compares the company’s share price to the value of its Bitcoin. Strategy running out of steam? 🚂💨 Before Aug 18, almost no new money came into $MSTR: 🔹 Aug 3: $0 🔹 Aug 10: ~$18M 🔹 Aug 17: ~$51M But after they dropped the “no dilution below 2.5x mNAV” promise, $359M was raised by issuing new shares (see tweet below). Policy changed.… https://t.co/nenuT1soI3 pic.twitter.com/pORoidxPhf — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) August 26, 2025 If the stock trades at more than four times its mNAV, the company will sell lots of shares to buy more Bitcoin. If it trades between 2.5 and four times, it will sell some shares, but more carefully. And if the stock drops below 2.5 times, share sales would mostly go toward paying debt or covering dividends instead of buying Bitcoin. Reports add that if Strategy shares trade under 1x mNAV, the company could borrow to repurchase stock. That framework reversed an earlier pledge not to sell shares for Bitcoin purchases when mNAV was below 2.5x — a reversal that critics point to as the key change. According to the company’s SEC filing, nearly $310 million came from at-the-market common stock sales at an average share price of $354, plus roughly $47 million from preferred share classes. In total, the firm raised a little more than $357 million and used the proceeds to buy 3,081 Bitcoin. The purchase pushed its holdings to 632,457 BTC. That stack of 632,457 coins equals roughly 3% of circulating supply, based on market counts cited in filings and market reports. The company’s public target remains at 1 million coins — a goal that, by the reported figures, is now about 60% complete. Investors focused on dilution have reason to be worried. Each new share increases the number of claims on the same Bitcoin pool, and when issuance happens while the stock trades at low multiples to mNAV, existing holders see their per-share Bitcoin backing decline. Reports say Strategy’s debt sits at about 20% of Bitcoin NAV with headroom up to 30%, giving it borrowing room — but choosing to issue equity at low mNAVs still weakens per-share economics.

Title: Globalists Are Rebranding Their “Woke Capitalism” Agenda After Crushing Setbacks

Time Published: 2025-08-28T14:00:00Z

Editor Economy Alt-Market.us, Brandon Smith People who carefully track the machinations of globalist institutions might have noticed a disturbing atmosphere of silence since the 2024 elections. I discussed this trend a few months ago in my article “Globalists Go Radio Silent As NATO Flirts With World War III”, specifically the dramatic shift that has taken place since the pandemic when organizations like the World Economic Forum ripped the mask off completely and admitted their true authoritarian intentions. By the end of 2021, most of the world was under maniacal technocratic control and the globalists seemed to think they had western civilization by the balls. The elites were constantly in the media openly touting their plans, from perpetual covid lockdowns, to vaccine passports, to climate lockdowns, to cashless digital monetary systems where all economic liberty is lost, to the “sharing economy” where private property is abolished, to the Fourth Industrial Revolution in which AI runs everything, to the “Great Reset” which would completely undermine the free market system and herald a socialist dystopia. In my 20 years as an economist, writer and analyst in the liberty movement I have never seen the globalists reveal their true intentions so brazenly. The pandemic exposed an incredible number of people to the underlying reality of the “New World Order” and in that span of around three years the awakening skyrocketed. The number of patriots born during covid was unprecedented. People realized it wasn’t a mere conspiracy theory. World events were not simply random products of chance and chaos. There was indeed a smoky god-damn room filled with nefarious plotting parasites. The march towards global governance was real and now everyone except the dumbest of the dumb knows it. The powers-that-be were so confident in the success of their endeavor that they essentially proclaimed global government by bureaucrats and corporations in the very midst of covid. Calling it the “Council for Inclusive Capitalism” working in collusion with the Vatican. The question we have to ask today is, where did it all go? The globalists were so confident and bold and now they are reticent. Did they give up? Or, are they rebranding their agenda yet again? For example, in 2020 almost no one knew what ESG was. By 2023 everyone understood that the meaningless acronym for “Environmental, Social, Governance” is actually an insidious cover designed to hide the woke capitalism agenda. Woke capitalism, also known as inclusive capitalism, is a centralization program which links together governments, bureaucratic agencies, NGOs as well as international banks and corporations under one ideological umbrella (globalism, multiculturalism, DEI, climate change, etc). This massive cartel uses monetary incentives and extortion to force businesses and individuals to conform to a woke/socialist model. For the last decade these groups have been funding a suffocating propaganda campaign, forcing woke indoctrination onto the masses. However, the globalists didn’t comprehend the level of push-back that they ultimately encountered. In their arrogance, they ended up inspiring more resistance, not less. And so, terms like ESG and DEI are being abandoned. Even Lynn Forester de Rothschild, head of the Council for Inclusive Capitalism, was forced to admit that ESG is dead and needs to be rebranded. Within the occult methodology the natural solution would be to adopt new organizations and new names but maintain the same goals. I’ve noticed that this happens often with the globalists. At one point the majority of their planning was done within the Council on Foreign Relations and the Bilderberg Group. Then it was the Club Of Rome and the UN. Then it was the IMF. Then the focus switched to Davos and the WEF. They used the term “New World Order”, then switched to “Multipolar World Order”, then to “the Great Reset” and the “Fourth Industrial Revolution”. This makes it very difficult for researchers to track the most current mechanisms of the conspiracy. I have found that, in the last year, “Stakeholder Capitalism” has become the fresh code for much of their renewed efforts. It’s not a new term, but it is being used more often by the elites to draw less attention. Some use the phrase “stakeholder capitalism 3.0” or “third phase stakeholder capitalism”. The original idea being that corporations can no longer make profits a priority. Rather, they must produce equal outcomes (not just equal opportunities) in order to participate in the interdependent international economy. In order to get access to the system, companies must promote approved narratives on climate and social justice, as well as partner with governments and NGOs to make DEI equity a reality. The companies that don’t participate will face pressure from government officials and will not be able to compete with companies that comply. The problem is, this requires that meritocracy be erased and that producers be forced to subsidize feeders on a planetary scale. That is to say, stakeholder capitalism is global communism cloaked in the humanist costume of corporate responsibility. The World Economic Forum seems to be doubling down on ESG and stakeholder capitalism with Blackrock CEO Larry Fink at the helm, despite growing public opposition. Though, Blackrock has removed a majority of ESG and DEI related language from their corporate reports. I recently came across an article published at the end of July from the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance which outlines the more discreet evolution of ESG (and DEI) in 2025. It reiterates similar observations made by globalists over the past year, that ESG must be rebranded but not abandoned. It argues that the old political virtue signaling and compliance checklists of the last decade must be set aside (for now) and that stakeholder capitalism should be presented as a “win-win” for the companies and communities involved. It is, in a way, an attempt to sell conservatives on the idea of ESG. One argument is that companies that engage in ESG-like policies “make more money” and gain more share value. Limited data is produced to support this claim, and I would point out that stock markets overall have been on a frightening bull run since the election. Companies that are NOT engaging in ESG are doing just as well as those that are, at least…in the US. Harvard notes that outflows from ESG funds are prevalent in America, but in the EU they are becoming more successful. I’m seeing similar trends in Canada and Australia – Anywhere that governments are working with globalists to enforce DEI standards on companies, ESG funds are obviously going to outperform. It’s a cartel, remember, and western political leaders are the enforcers. The US is the only place where ESG is in retreat. This could change in the near term as Europeans grow increasingly rebellious against the multicultural coup, but it does illustrate the fact that woke capitalism (stakeholder capitalism) cannot survive without government intervention. This is not to say that progress in the fight against globalism has not been made. I grow tired of blackpilled mouth-breathers that act as if there have been no victories and that everything is going “according to the globalist plan”. If this was true then they would have proudly and publicly moved forward with their Great Reset instead of running back into the shadows. That said, vigilance requires temperance. Behind the scenes many corporations are still introducing woke policies and they are even advancing the globalist takeover in Europe. The fight must focus on these specific companies and their NGO partners; it is not the job of corporations (or leftist politicians and NGOs) to enact social engineering. They are not qualified to determine the greater good because they are not good people. They are driven by the desire for power, not morality or reason. The globalists have lost the information war, but they keep coming back because they have yet to face real world consequences for their hubris. The only way to end the nightmare permanently is to dissolve the structures that give them their influence, or, remove them from the equation entirely.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. The latest round of layoffs comes almost two months after the cancellation of the Perfect Dark reboot. By Evan Campbell on August 28, 2025 at 7:04AM PDT Developer Crystal Dynamics is laying off more members from the team, though not detailing the total number of people impacted. This is the second round of cuts at the Tomb Raider studio within the last six months--and the first since the Perfect Dark reboot was canned. On LinkedIn, the official Crystal Dynamics account announced the layoffs. "This decision was not made lightly," the post reads. "It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market." The language is pretty similar to what Crystal Dynamics stated after 17 people were laid off in March: "We did not make this decision lightly." The biggest known project at Crystal Dynamics currently is the next Tomb Raider. The game starring Lara Croft will be published by Amazon Games, and Crystal Dynamics noted that "the future of Tomb Raider" is "unaffected by this decision." Earlier this year, the developer stated that the next Tomb Raider and Perfect Dark reboot wouldn't be affected by downsizing, either. However, Microsoft canceled Perfect Dark--a game that Crystal Dynamics was co-developing--last month. The other main studio working on the game, The Initiative, was shuttered. Amazon was also previously working on a Tomb Raider show, but that's reportedly dead now. Along with Tomb Raider, Crystal Dynamics is known for the Gex and Legacy of Kain video game franchises.

Title: Plant-Based Savings: Cut Grocery Bills 19% in 15 Minutes
URL: https://food-hacks.wonderhowto.com/how-to/plant-based-savings-cut-grocery-bills-19-in-15-minutes/
Time Published: 2025-08-28T13:39:49Z

Got 15 minutes and a wallet that's feeling a little light? Here's how to slash your grocery bills while eating amazing plant-based meals. Research shows that switching to a whole-food vegan diet can cut food costs by 19 percentâthat's about $650 in savings per year. The secret isn't complicated: plant-based staples like brown rice, potatoes, and beans are some of the cheapest and healthiest ingredients in the supermarket. Plus, inflation has hit meat at nearly twice the rate of vegetables, making this the perfect time to master these money-saving plant-based hacks. The foundation of budget vegan cooking lies in stocking up on versatile, shelf-stable ingredients that work in dozens of recipes. Dried beans and rice are ridiculously cheap and often overlookedâa 5-pound bag of brown rice plus 2 pounds of frozen broccoli costs about $6 and lasts for weeks. Buying staples in bulk is huge, since these ingredients can transform into burgers, taco fillings, hummus, and much more. Plant proteins like beans, lentils, and tofu are economical choices that pack serious nutrition without the premium price tag. Here's where smart pantry building gets interesting: focus on ingredients that multitask across cuisines. That same cup of brown rice gives you 5 grams of protein and 3.5 grams of fiber, and when you combine that with half a cup of broccoli, you're up to 7 grams of protein and 5.5 grams of fiber. But the real magic happens when you learn to season these basics differentlyâcumin and lime for Mexican bowls, ginger and soy for Asian stir-fries, or herbs and lemon for Mediterranean grain salads. Pro tip: Hit up Asian or Latin grocery stores for bulk rice, grains, and spices at unbeatable prices. Stock your freezer with frozen vegetablesâthey're flash-frozen at peak ripeness to retain nutrients and cost a fraction of fresh out-of-season produce. Planning isn't just about organizationâit's your secret weapon against impulse buys and food waste. Taking a few minutes before your store trip to map out meals and compile a shopping list saves both time and money. Plan meals around affordable staples like rice, beans, lentils, and seasonal vegetables, then build variety around those base ingredients. Budget-friendly couples have managed to eat for just $15 Canadian per dayâthat's less than $2.50 per meal by focusing on smart planning. The brilliant thing about strategic planning is how it actually unlocks creativity rather than limiting it. When you know you've got rice, black beans, and frozen corn as your weekly foundation, you can transform them with different spice blends: Monday gets Mexican flair with cumin and lime, Wednesday goes Asian with ginger and soy sauce, Friday turns Mediterranean with herbs and lemon. This rotation strategy means you're buying the same affordable base ingredients but never eating boring meals. Build your weekly menu around one-pot meals, grain bowls, and soups that stretch ingredients into multiple servings. Batch cooking is perfect for bulk ingredientsâcook once and you're set for days, saving time you could use for side gigs or just relaxing. Your shopping strategy can make or break your budget. Choose store brands over name brandsâthey're often identical products for a fraction of the cost. Shop the perimeter where whole foods like fresh produce, grains, and legumes live, avoiding the expensive processed foods in center aisles. Embrace "ugly" vegetablesâthat imperfect carrot is just as nutritious as the pristine one but costs way less. Timing your shopping trips strategically can unlock serious savings most people miss entirely. Shop early weekday mornings when stores are fully stocked and crowds are minimal. Focus on seasonal produce when it's abundant and naturally cheaperâsummer squash in July, root vegetables in fall, citrus in winter. Use apps like "Our Groceries" that allow multiple users to update the same listâperfect for couples, roommates, or families who want to coordinate their shopping without duplicate purchases. Shopping rotation hack: Get to know different stores' strengths. Hit budget stores for dried beans, pasta, and canned goods. Save the fancy grocery trips for fresh produce, nuts, and specialty items. Frozen organic vegetables are often much less expensive at warehouse stores like Costco. The magic happens when you learn to make expensive alternatives at home using whole foods. Making seitan costs as little as 50p for a bag of flour versus several dollars for store-bought versions. Aquafaba (that liquid from chickpea cans) whips into mayo in 10 seconds flat. Dehydrated soya chunks can be much cheaper than frozen proteins and rehydrate into satisfying, meaty textures. The learning curve here is gentler than you'd expect, and the payoff is huge. Take that basic tahini dressing: blend tahini, lemon juice, water, and a pinch of salt, and you've got something that costs pennies but rivals expensive store-bought dressings. Store it in the fridge for up to a week, or make flavor variations by adding garlic for punch, herbs for freshness, or maple syrup for subtle sweetness. This one simple sauce elevates everything from grain bowls to roasted vegetables to raw salads. A pack of dried beans yields roughly double its weight when cooked, so 500g gives you the equivalent of four drained tins at a fraction of the cost. Zero-waste cooking means using every part of your ingredients to reduce food waste and get more from what you already have. Save vegetable scraps in the freezer to make broth at homeâthose onion skins, carrot tops, and herb stems create rich, flavorful stock for free. Use all parts of your produce, including dual-use vegetables like carrots with their leafy tops. This isn't about being a perfectionistâit's about being practical with preservation techniques that actually save money. That bunch of cilantro you bought for tacos? Chop the stems into your freezer scrap bag for broth, blend any wilting leaves into ice cube trays with olive oil for instant flavor bombs, or quickly blanch and freeze whole sprigs in bags for later use. These simple preservation methods mean you're getting multiple uses from single purchases. Repurpose leftovers creatively to minimize waste and stretch your grocery dollars. That leftover rice becomes fried rice, grain salads, or soup base. Wilting greens get a second life in smoothies, soups, or pesto. Freeze unused produce before it spoilsâthose browning bananas are perfect for smoothies and baking. The bottom line? Plant-based eating can cost less than $2 per serving with the right approach. Studies consistently show that people eating plant-based spend less on food than any other group, with savings jumping to $900 annually compared to Mediterranean diets. The core of a vegan dietâwhole grains, beans, vegetables, and fruitsâis among the most affordable foods available. You don't need to go full vegan overnight to see these benefits. Start with Meatless Monday and gradually build your confidence with one new plant-based recipe each week. Focus on mastering a few simple, satisfying base recipes firstâlike a versatile grain bowl template or a basic bean and vegetable soupâthen expand your skills as you discover which flavors and techniques you enjoy most. The beauty of this approach is that you're not just saving money now, you're building sustainable cooking skills that compound over time. Your grocery budgetâand your healthâwill reward you for making the switch to these smart, sustainable eating habits.

Title: Wall Street Largely Cheers Nvidia's Outlook Even as China Remains an Overhang

Nvidia’s (NVDA) results and outlook elicited a mixed response from Wall Street analysts on Thursday, with some cheering the chip giant's revenue forecast and others lamenting uncertainty around sales to China. The poster child for the AI boom on Wednesday projected third-quarter revenue of $54 billion, plus or minus 2%. The forecast exceeded Wall Street's official estimate of $53.8 billion, but by a narrower margin than many investors have come to expect. Nvidia issued its guidance as it posted better-than-estimated second-quarter results, although key data center revenue lagged forecasts. Nvidia shares are down around 2% in early trading on Thursday, but have retraced larger after-hours declines following the results. Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to $210 from $206 and kept its overweight call, saying Nvidia shares are "less expensive than other AI beneficiaries." They said the "bar [set by Nvidia] continues to be high but the growth acceleration is clear." “For the stock to sell off slightly after hours on these types of numbers certainly indicates that sentiment has largely caught up to the growth potential, after fears of digestion just a few weeks ago,” they wrote. “But outside of China geopolitics, this is a very clean beat and raise quarter." Nvidia CFO Collette Kress said during the earnings call Wednesday that the company hasn't restarted sales of its H20 chips in China yet while the company waits for the U.S. government to formalize its revenue-sharing agreement. Earlier this year, the Trump administration blocked Nvidia’s sale of its H20 chips, which the company tailored for the Chinese market, then this month struck a deal where Nvidia would give the government 15% of China chip revenues in exchange for resumed sales. UBS analysts said they were optimistic on the prospects the rally in the AI-driven bull market would continue after Nvidia's results. “The overall strength of the July quarter results may offer some reassurance for investors after signs of stalling momentum for the large-cap tech rally,” UBS analysts wrote, adding that “the outlook for large-cap tech remains compelling.” Several of Nvidia’s major Big Tech clients, including Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), have committed to spending big on their AI capacity, and Nvidia said Wednesday that one customer spent more than $10 billion last quarter. Kress said late Wednesday that the chipmaker anticipates $3 trillion–4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. HSBC was less upbeat, however, saying Nvidia hasn't delivered a "beat and raise" quarter since its second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings last year. "We maintain our Hold rating as we expect the near-term supply inconsistency and China uncertainty to remain an overhang," they wrote. Even Morgan Stanley analysts noted that prospects for a resumption of China sales are unclear, and that uncertainties remain around the 15% revenue deal with the government and the need for Beijing to give the green light to resume chip sales. China accounted for 20% of Nvidia’s data center revenue at one point and “while it remains a large market, we simply don’t know how large it will be when it comes back, or if it comes back at all," the analysts wrote. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.

"We maintain our Hold rating as we expect the near-term supply inconsistency and China uncertainty to remain an overhang," they wrote. Even Morgan Stanley analysts noted that prospects for a resumption of China sales are unclear, and that uncertainties remain around the 15% revenue deal with the government and the need for Beijing to give the green light to resume chip sales.

Nvidia’s (NVDA) results and outlook elicited a mixed response from Wall Street analysts on Thursday, with some cheering the chip giant's revenue forecast and others lamenting uncertainty around sales to China. The poster child for the AI boom on Wednesday projected third-quarter revenue of $54 billion, plus or minus 2%. The forecast exceeded Wall Street's official estimate of $53.8 billion, but by a narrower margin than many investors have come to expect. Nvidia issued its guidance as it posted better-than-estimated second-quarter results, although key data center revenue lagged forecasts. Nvidia shares are down around 2% in early trading on Thursday, but have retraced larger after-hours declines following the results. Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to $210 from $206 and kept its overweight call, saying Nvidia shares are "less expensive than other AI beneficiaries." They said the "bar [set by Nvidia] continues to be high but the growth acceleration is clear." “For the stock to sell off slightly after hours on these types of numbers certainly indicates that sentiment has largely caught up to the growth potential, after fears of digestion just a few weeks ago,” they wrote. “But outside of China geopolitics, this is a very clean beat and raise quarter." Nvidia CFO Collette Kress said during the earnings call Wednesday that the company hasn't restarted sales of its H20 chips in China yet while the company waits for the U.S. government to formalize its revenue-sharing agreement. Earlier this year, the Trump administration blocked Nvidia’s sale of its H20 chips, which the company tailored for the Chinese market, then this month struck a deal where Nvidia would give the government 15% of China chip revenues in exchange for resumed sales. UBS analysts said they were optimistic on the prospects the rally in the AI-driven bull market would continue after Nvidia's results. “The overall strength of the July quarter results may offer some reassurance for investors after signs of stalling momentum for the large-cap tech rally,” UBS analysts wrote, adding that “the outlook for large-cap tech remains compelling.” Several of Nvidia’s major Big Tech clients, including Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), have committed to spending big on their AI capacity, and Nvidia said Wednesday that one customer spent more than $10 billion last quarter. Kress said late Wednesday that the chipmaker anticipates $3 trillion–4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. HSBC was less upbeat, however, saying Nvidia hasn't delivered a "beat and raise" quarter since its second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings last year.

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto have rocketed higher over the last year, with Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff admitting he got bitcoin wrong ten years ago and warned a coming dollar “crisis" could propel crypto higher. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price hit an all-time high of $124,000 this month before crypto market crash fears sent it sharply lower—while traders warned they were seeing other “market top” signs. Now, as Elon Musk confirms his “only” crypto, the bitcoin price and crypto market has been primed for $20 million to $28 million of daily buying pressure as part of $84 trillion set to pass from U.S. Baby Boomers to younger heirs by 2045. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run "As Baby Boomers, who collectively control more than half of the global wealth, age and begin to pass on their estates, an estimated $84 trillion is expected to change hands in the United States alone by 2045," analysts with crypto friendly Xapo Bank wrote in a report, citing research from Vanguard. “Globally, this figure reaches approximately $10.6 trillion by 2030 in the U.S., $3.5 trillion in Europe, and $2.8 trillion in Asia.” The report pointed to research that showed younger generations are more likely to invest in bitcoin and crypto than older generations. “Numerous surveys measuring crypto adoption across generations find that these younger generations have at least 3x higher adoption or acceptance rates of crypto compared to Baby Boomers,” Charles Yu, vice president of research at Galaxy Digital, wrote in 2023. Xapo researchers went on to predict the so-called “great wealth transfer” will lead to the creation of new "bitcoin dynasties," families like the Rockefellers or Rothschilds who build up generational wealth through bitcoin and crypto. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious “A defining outcome of the digital asset revolution is the emergence of ‘bitcoin dynasties’—families and individuals whose multigenerational wealth is rooted in cryptocurrency holdings," the Xapo report authors wrote. "These modern dynasties are drawing comparisons to legacy wealthy families such as the Rockefellers or Rothschilds. Unlike traditional sources of wealth based in land, industrial enterprise, or equities, these dynasties are building and preserving their fortunes on the decentralised rails of blockchain technology." The bitcoin price boom since bitcoin crashed to a recent low of $16,000 in 2023 has been driven by huge adoption of crypto on Wall Street, led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock and its $83 trillion spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). U.S. president Donald Trump’s embrace of bitcoin and crypto has further supported the market over the last year. On the campaign trail before retaking the White House, Trump pledged to create a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve similar to the U.S. gold reserve as well as a broader crypto stockpile, ordering their creation in April.

Title: 150 job applications, rescinded offers: Computer science grads are struggling to find work | CNN Business
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/28/tech/computer-science-graduates-job-hunt-ai
Time Published: 2025-08-28T10:48:56Z

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Abraham Rubio has wanted to be a software engineer since childhood. On the gaming platform Minecraft, he loved tinkering with “mods,” or alterations to video games created by fans that change elements like a character’s appearance. Eventually, he wasn’t content with just discovering new mods — he wanted to build his own. That early passion led him to study coding at Bloomfield College of Montclair State University in New Jersey, graduating with a degree in computer science and game programming in May. But finding a software development job has proven challenging. Rubio has applied for 20 roles since graduation. He’s yet to receive an offer. “I go on LinkedIn almost every day, just scrolling, trying to see what opportunities are out there,” he said, adding that he hasn’t “really heard anything back from most companies.” For years — as Silicon Valley boomed and all kinds of companies invested in new tech capabilities — computer science degrees, or even certificates from coding bootcamps, seemed like a golden ticket to a sustainable, well-paying job in a fast-paced industry. But in recent years, job openings have become more competitive and harder to come by. Employment for recent graduates in computer science and math jobs has declined by 8% since 2022, Oxford Economics found in a May report. Postings for software development roles on the job site Indeed fell 71% between February 2022 to August 2025, according to Indeed data shared by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. With the tech world racing to make artificial intelligence advancements, some new grads say it feels like an especially exciting time to enter the industry. However, AI is also enabling companies to automate some parts of the coding and software development process, reducing the need for human workers, especially in entry-level roles. While tech giants’ valuations continue to soar, many have undergone multiple rounds of layoffs in recent years as they push to accomplish more work with fewer people, a trend that has only been accelerated by AI. Microsoft, for example, became the second company to reach a $4 trillion valuation last month. That was only weeks after saying it would lay off 9,000 employees in its third round of cuts in recent months. CEO Satya Nadella said in April that as much as 30% of Microsoft’s code was being written by AI. “Tech jobs are good, but I will say, the job market right now makes it seem that it’s almost impossible to get one,” said Julio Rodriguez, who graduated last year from Elms College in Massachusetts. He said it took him more than 150 applications before he got a data engineer job earlier this summer. “And then when you get one, you’re also scared of the many layoffs that many companies are having,” he added. CNN spoke with half a dozen job seekers about how they’re navigating the job market, educators training the industry’s next generation of engineers as well as current coders and tech leaders about whether computer science degrees could become obsolete. Nick Vinokour had a dream job lined up after he graduated in December from the University of Michigan with a computer science degree — he had been hired as a strategic projects lead at data labeling startup Scale AI. He was set to start in August. “I was super excited, it was a great opportunity,” Vinokour said. But after Meta invested $14.3 billion into Scale AI in June, acquiring its CEO, Vinokour got an email saying his offer was being rescinded amid a corporate restructuring. Now, he’s still on the hunt for a job. While Vinokour largely believes the state of the economy and stiff competition among recent computer science graduates are to blame for the tough job market, the role of AI has certainly crossed his mind. AI coding tools such as Microsoft’s Copilot and Anysphere’s Cursor are like “a big tidal wave that’s looming to change what the role of a junior engineer is,” he said. (A Scale spokesperson acknowledged that some employees were laid off or had offers rescinded in July, but said Scale is now aggressively hiring for positions across the company.) Some recent computer science grads have turned to TikTok to share frustrations around the current tech job market. A TikTok user named Lili, who goes by @queenofslack on the app, posted a video last month discouraging other students from studying computer science due to her own difficult job hunt. “I think the investment, the difficulty of (computer science) is not worth the instability of the job,” she said. “If you’re really just being motivated by a paycheck and by a cushy job, I can’t say that I would recommend.” Of the more than 250 comments on the video, dozens were from fellow computer science graduates or students expressing similar concerns about their career path. College graduates, broadly, are struggling. A May report from Oxford Economics found that the unemployment rate for recent grads is now greater than the national average. But for job seekers in tech, the data is especially troubling. The New York Fed now pegs the unemployment rate for recent computer science and computer engineering graduates (6.1% and 7.5%, respectively) higher than that for people who studied art history (3%), English (4.9%) and performing arts (2.7%). Recent grads told CNN that they don’t think AI will do away with software engineering jobs entirely. As Brianne Ford, who graduated from the State University of New York at New Paltz in May, put it: “Code always needs maintaining.” But there are fears that the technology will usurp opportunities for people looking to break into the field. For entry-level jobs, “they want us to have tons of internships or tons of projects and when you’re in school, you don’t really get as much of a chance,” Ford said. “Me, personally, I worked as a resident advisor to help pay for school.” Vinokour said job seekers his age are in a “pickle” — wanting to take part in the AI boom, but competing against more experienced developers for jobs, especially as some companies slow down or change their hiring plans. “It’s this very weird middle ground that’s exciting because (the industry is) on the precipice of this insane technology. But … it’s harder for a junior engineer to be hired,” Vinokour said. Or as Rubio puts it: “It feels like I’m competing with AI to just try to get my foot in the door.” Some are now reconsidering whether software engineering is truly a viable career path. “I’m pretty pessimistic right now,” said Danny Stalmakov, a Germany-based software developer who graduated with his master’s degree in computer science in 2022. Stalmakov, who said he’s submitted hundreds of applications over six months, has been told by recruiters that there are simply too many applicants for each role. But he also sees the benefit of AI, which now handles 80% of his development work. “While the productivity boost is incredible, it’s also concerning — companies that used to need five developers might only need three now,” he said. “The AI impact on coding made me genuinely unsure about my future in software development, and I really don’t know what my next move will be if the market stays like this,” Stalmakov added. Educators teaching coding and computer science are having to pivot their curriculum to prepare students for a rapidly evolving job market. Magdalena Balazinska, director of the University of Washington’s Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering, said the hiring slowdown is not just because AI is taking coding work. Tech companies are also right-sizing after a Covid-era hiring spree and need to spend wisely amid multibillion-dollar AI infrastructure investments. Balazinska said it’s not all doom and gloom — more than half of the school’s approximately 675 graduates from the 2024-25 school year have already found full-time jobs at companies including Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Google. Nonetheless, the school is evolving for the AI era, she said. It’s rolling out a new “AI-assisted software development” course this fall, where students will learn about modern software engineering practices and the role of AI as a tool for that work. Some advanced classes will also allow students to use generative AI, “which is enabling faculty members to raise the level of difficulty and complexity of the projects,” Balazinska said. But introductory courses will still prohibit using AI for classwork — so students learn the basics without relying too much on the technology. “Our philosophy has always been that computer science is a field that advances faster than any other field, so preparing students to advance with the field is the most important thing we can do,” Balazinska said. “There will be jobs for those who learn the latest advances in computing and those with excellent skills and knowledge,” she said. It’s not just universities that are changing their approach. Coding bootcamps — specialized schools often catering to career switchers or students looking to pursue careers in tech without a four-year degree — have adapted, too. The idea of landing a lucrative six-figure salary without a traditional degree, combined with an increased hiring demand from the tech industry, led to a boom in enrollment at these bootcamps throughout the 2010s. But Daniele Grassi, CEO of tech bootcamp General Assembly, said he’s noticed a shift over the past couple of years in the types of customers coming to his school. While General Assembly primarily attracted aspiring software engineers for much of its 14-year existence, the school is now also garnering interest from C-level executives, human resource managers and sales professionals interested in developing their AI skills. As a result, General Assembly has begun creating programs specifically designed to help workers across all tiers of a company —from entry level to the board of directors, whether the roles are technical or not — gain new AI skills, according to Grassi. “Six months ago, or nine months ago … we realized that every role is disrupted,” Grassi told CNN. General Assembly has incorporated AI skills teachings into its programming across disciplines, said Jeffrey Bergin, the school’s chief learning officer, so that everything it offers “now has an AI element.” The school offers courses in data analytics, user experience design, data science and information technology in addition to software engineering. Bergin said the school wants “to make sure folks have what they need, both in being able to apply those skills and to take those skills into job interviews and into employers, and have those really resonate.” Tech leaders say they’ll still need young people with computer science degrees, even if there are fewer jobs to go around. “The thing people study is computer science, which is a lot more than code. It’s understanding how these systems work,” Deepak Singh, vice president of developer agents and experiences at Amazon Web Services, told CNN. “The critical thinking part doesn’t change. You still need to be able to think, you need to be creative. I actually think it becomes more important because you have more time” to be creative with AI doing the grunt work. Still, that may be cold comfort to new grads, given Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s recent warning that the company will need fewer human workers in the future as AI takes on more tasks. Beyond big tech, many AI startups are also focused on growing with the smallest teams possible. “The AI boom isn’t following the patterns of past tech cycles,” Kyle Holm, vice president of the compensation advisory group at consulting firm Sequoia, wrote in a blog post last month. “The traditional model of high-growth companies expanding headcount, investing in people teams, and broadly distributing equity isn’t playing out the same way this time.” David Barajas, who has been working as a full-time software engineer for more than a decade, said he would feel “intimidated” by the rise of AI tools in coding if he were a junior engineer. But overall, he’s of the mindset that AI will change the job rather than wipe it out completely — as long as aspiring engineers embrace it, that is. “AI won’t replace you as an engineer,” Barajas said. “An engineer with AI will replace you as an engineer.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Following Perfect Dark reboot's cancellation Tomb Raider developers Crystal Dynamics have laid off an unspecified number of staff, their second round of jobs cuts this year. The studio say that the future of the Tomb Raider series won't be affected by this latest taking away of folks' livelihoods. The news comes not too long after the Perfect Dark reboot Crystal Dynamics were working alongside The Initiative was cancelled amid Microsoft's mass cuts in July. The Initiative were shut down as part of that culling. Crystal Dynamics announced these layoffs via LinkedIn post, which neglected to mention exactly how many staff had been let go. "Today we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions," they wrote. "This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market. To those impacted - we recognize and thank you for your hard work, talent, and passion. We are committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition." Crystal Dynamics added that the future of Tomb Raider is "unaffected" by these job cuts. There's currently a new Tomb Raider in the works, and it's set to be published by Amazon. Among the former Crystal Dynamics staff who've shared that they're among those laid off are senior animator Jaron Gittleman and senior designer Matthew Angus. "Well it finally happened," Gittleman wrote on LinkedIn. "After nearly 8 long years I've been laid off from Crystal Dynamics. It's been a helluva run. From Avengers to Tomb Raider to Perfect Dark it has been a journey of a ton of growth. I learned so much and worked with some of the best. I'll miss them dearly." Best of luck to all affected.

Bitcoin Hyper demonstrates a strong commitment to security and transparency. It passed security audits from both SolidProof and Coinsult. When a project has direct ties to Bitcoin, it naturally makes people stop and take notice. Bitcoin, after all, is the dominant force that leads the market and shapes emerging trends. If you also factor in the attention $BTC has been gaining in the media recently, it’s not surprising that altcoins like $HYPER are gaining more traction. With it also being very early in the presale, the $HYPER price is low, and for some, this is a big draw. Add in the impressive staking APY currently available, and it’s easy to see why $HYPER is getting noticed. Our $HYPER price prediction targets $0.32 by the end of 2025, a 2,400%+ gain from the current price. Bitcoin Hyper offers several key utilities to make Bitcoin more powerful and easier to use for modern applications. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has a fixed token supply with a large proportion set aside for marketing and development, showing it aims for steady long-term growth and stability. Due to the presale being public only, showing fairness to all investors, and the obvious utility for the OG digital asset, $HYPER could see a high demand when it lists on exchanges, helping its performance. As with any project, $HYPER’s success will come down to two factors: With that being said, it stands a good chance due to its close link to $BTC. The $HYPER roadmap has five distinct phases: This seems like a sound plan, and we look forward to it coming to fruition. You can find more details in the project’s whitepaper. $HYPER has over 18K subscribers on X and 3.8K+ subscribers on Telegram, which shows how quickly the project is attracting attention even though it has only launched recently. The X feed is constantly updated, sharing developments and key funding milestones, so investors know the latest information about the project. Substantial token allocation for marketing (20%) and rewards (15%) should help the project expand its reach quickly. VISIT BITCOIN HYPER’S WEBSITE You should buy $HYPER if you’re excited by the project’s vision. Bitcoin Hyper could transform Bitcoin into a high-speed hub for dApps, DeFi, and NFTs by integrating Solana’s SVM technology, effectively unleashing a new wave of innovation on the world’s most secure blockchain. With Bitcoin dominating the headlines and remaining the digital equivalent of gold, it could be a good time to buy into $BTC-related crypto projects that often follow $BTC’s market performance and behaviours. But $HYPER may not be for you if you’re a risk-averse investor, as this is an early-stage opportunity and thus highly volatile. Alternatively, the technological aspects might not be something you care about, and you’re after something more meme-centric, in which case give $HYPER a miss. $HYPER is exciting, but it’s not the only promising crypto presale this year. Check out a few of the others we think are worth your time. $HYPER offers extremely appealing staking rewards, but its utility and potential impact on Bitcoin is where it really shines. It’s powering a Layer-2 network that aims to fundamentally transform Bitcoin, thereby unlocking a new frontier of dApps, DeFi, and gaming on Bitcoin’s secure foundation. With community support and its link to Bitcoin, $HYPER is showing it’s got the potential catch on and stand a good chance of success. But remember the crypto market is volatile. The success or failure of a project can come very quickly, often impacted by internal project factors, but also by the broader economic context. VISIT BITCOIN HYPER’S WEBSITE You can buy $HYPER on the official Bitcoin Hyper presale website by connecting your wallet, selecting a purchase method, and entering how much you want to buy. Yes, you can stake $HYPER for 99% APY on the official Bitcoin Hyper website. The rewards are dynamic and will go down as more people join the staking pool. You can unstake your tokens at any time during or after the presale, but the rewards will be unlocked over 2 years. The best alternative is Snorter Token ($SNORT), another utility project with a multi-chain Telegram sniping bot. While this project doesn’t bring blockchain upscaling tech, it does put forward a multi-purpose bot to help traders snipe early crypto opportunities and avoid scams. Having undergone security audits, $HYPER is as secure as any crypto investment can be. Its smart contract has no honeypot, blacklist, or mint functions. While the token is legit, remember the crypto market is volatile and there are no profit guarantees.

Title: Tesseract and the Future of Yield
URL: https://www.privatebankerinternational.com/features/tesseract-and-the-future-of-yield/
Time Published: 2025-08-28T09:53:58Z
Full Content:
For James Harris, the newly appointed Group CEO of Tesseract, taking the helm of the Helsinki-based digital asset lender is both a culmination of years of leadership in financial technology and the beginning of a bold new chapter. “Joining Tesseract was both a natural progression and a step up,” Harris reflects. “At CoinDesk Data and Zodia Custody, I helped shape strategy and led commercial growth, but I wasn’t the final decision-maker. Having run smaller businesses in the past, I knew I was ready for the challenge of stepping into the CEO role and taking full accountability.” The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more That accountability now extends across Tesseract’s $500m in assets under management and over $1bn in originated loans. Harris inherits a company with solid foundations, a reputation for reliable yield services, a team with deep institutional experience, and strong partnerships, including with Bitstamp (now part of Robinhood). Yet, as he sees it, the company remains underappreciated in a crowded marketplace. “Tesseract has a product that works, a talented team, and a track record,” he says. “But it hasn’t yet achieved the scale or visibility it deserves. Helping it fulfils that potential and become a category-defining company in crypto yield is exactly the kind of challenge that energises me at this point in my career.” At the heart of Harris’s vision is a deceptively simple ambition: make earning yield on digital assets as safe, seamless, and predictable as holding a government bond. “Whether you’re an exchange offering Earn products to your users, or a corporate treasury looking to deploy assets responsibly, you should be able to plug into Tesseract and access curated, institutional-grade yield strategies without needing to navigate DeFi, counterparties, custody, or regulation yourself,” Harris explains. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. This philosophy, what he calls “Yield as Infrastructure” underpins Tesseract’s model. The company provides a modular, API-driven platform that connects client capital to carefully managed opportunities across CeFi and DeFi. The risk, regulatory, and operational burdens are absorbed by Tesseract, freeing partners to focus on growth. “Our edge lies in that full-stack approach,” Harris says. “Most firms either focus on custody, trading, or asset management. We sit across all three, which gives us a better vantage point on risk and access. And importantly, we’re in the process of obtaining European regulatory authorisation, including specific permissions to deploy assets into DeFi something most competitors simply can’t do.” With a foundation in place, Harris is already looking two to three years ahead. “We can significantly grow AUM by expanding distribution and broadening our product shelf,” he says. Planned innovations include risk-banded yield strategies, tokenised vaults, and hybrid yield-powered asset management products tailored for fintech’s, family offices, and institutions. The company is also positioning itself as a bridge for traditional financial institutions tentatively entering the digital asset world. “There’s a huge opportunity in helping large TradFi firms dip their toes into on-chain yield in a way that’s measurable and compliant,” Harris notes. “We want to make crypto yield predictable, trusted and maybe even a little bit boring.” The timing appears right. Institutional adoption of digital assets is gathering momentum, driven by three converging forces: clearer regulation, macroeconomic pressure, and improved infrastructure. “In the US, initiatives like the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts are landmark moments. In Europe, MiCA is now live. That level of clarity would have been aspirational just two years ago,” Harris argues. “When firms like BlackRock are tokenising treasuries and building on public blockchains, it’s a strong signal the tide has turned.” Meanwhile, with rate cuts looming and real yields under pressure, institutional investors are looking elsewhere for returns. Crypto-native strategies offering 5–15% through staking or protocol-based lending are increasingly difficult to ignore. “Many still assume crypto yield is either too risky or unregulated,” Harris admits. “That’s a misconception. There’s a big difference between chasing unsustainable APYs and allocating to risk-managed, on-chain strategies run by professionals with controls and accountability. The gap in understanding is narrowing, but we need to keep building trust.” To that end, Tesseract has embedded compliance, credit, and liquidity oversight into every layer of its stack. Its modular infrastructure is designed to integrate seamlessly into institutional workflows, with APIs, segregated wallets, and granular reporting. If trust is the end goal, regulation is the foundation. For Harris, Europe’s MiCA framework is both a challenge and an opportunity. “Regulation is the defining lens for any serious crypto business,” he says. “MiCA raised the bar, but it also gave institutions the clarity they’ve been waiting for. We’ve shaped our strategy around operating in this arena and expect to be fully MiCA-compliant ahead of year-end.” This requires heavy investment in compliance infrastructure and audit-ready processes, but Harris sees the payoff as significant. “Smaller players may struggle with the cost and complexity. For us, compliance becomes a competitive advantage, it attracts capital and legitimises what we do.” A particular area of focus is stablecoins, which power around 70% of DeFi yield flows. “Stablecoins are central to our strategy,” Harris explains. “We treat them like any other yield-bearing instrument: analysing issuer risk, regulatory status, reserves, and redemption mechanics. Algorithmic stablecoins we mostly avoid; fiat-backed types like USDC remain the core.” MiCA will tighten rules around stablecoins, including capping their circulation in some cases, but Harris views this as positive. “Our B2B clients want yield, but they need confidence. By combining stablecoin yields with real-world assets, staking, and protocol lending, we can offer diversified, risk-adjusted solutions.” Looking further ahead, Harris believes the most enduring innovations in decentralised finance will centre around real-world integration and institutional adoption. “Three developments stand out,” he says. “First, real-world asset tokenisation—on-chain treasuries, bonds, and money market funds will unlock over $1tn in flows by 2030. Second, cross-chain yield infrastructure like EigenLayer reduces fragmentation and expands opportunity. Third, compliant hybrids that blend DeFi yield with institutional-grade wrappers will dominate.” Harris is confident that DeFi and traditional finance are on a path of convergence. “TradFi is adopting blockchain for efficiency, while DeFi is adapting to regulatory and institutional requirements. In five years, yield products will likely look like hybrids: tokenised treasuries earning DeFi-based yield, wrapped in compliant structures and integrated directly into banks and fintechs.” Will the future be decentralised or institution-led? Harris sees a pragmatic outcome. “In terms of scale, institutions will dominate they have the capital, compliance engines, and distribution. But the energy and innovation still comes from the edges. Our job is to capture the best of both worlds and deliver compliant, risk-adjusted returns.” For all the talk of 2030, Harris is keenly focused on the next year. Milestones ahead include: “We’re not trying to do everything,” Harris stresses. “We’re focused on a few critical things we can do exceptionally well, and by doing so, build a durable platform for long-term growth.” As for the biggest misconception he’d like to put to rest. “That digital asset yields are inherently reckless,” he says firmly. “The reality is they can be responsibly managed, risk-adjusted, and institutionally scalable. That’s the future we’re building at Tesseract.”

Title: Crystal Dynamics subject to more layoffs following Perfect Dark cancellation

Tomb Raider remains unaffected. Crystal Dynamics has announced the "difficult decision" to lay off more staff, citing "evolving business conditions". It added the decision was not made lightly, but was necessary to "ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market". In a post shared on LinkedIn, the studio thanked those impacted by these layoffs for their "hard work, talent and passion", stating Crystal Dynamics is "committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition". It went on to additionally thank the rest of its team, as well as its community and partners for the "continued support" as the studio builds a "creative, sustainable, and resilient tomorrow together". The next entry in the Tomb Raider series - which is being developed in collaboration with Amazon - is not affected by these most recent layoffs at Crystal Dynamics. This week's layoffs follow the cancellation of Perfect Dark earlier this year by Microsoft. While the reboot was being helmed by The Initiative, Crystal Dynamics was supporting the project. Well this is it. I was let go from Crystal Dynamics as Perfect Dark was cancelled. I am now out of a job. I genuinely dont know what to do at this moment but to frantically apply for as many jobs that are applicable. If anyone needs a Senior Environment Artist of 10+ years, please let me know. The studio previously laid off 17 staff members in March of this year. At this time, Crystal Dynamics said this was "necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio's future success", and was "not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected". This is a news-in-brief story. This is part of our vision to bring you all the big news as part of a daily live report.

Title: Media & Marketing Financials – August 2025
URL: https://www.exchangewire.com/blog/2025/08/28/media-marketing-financials-august-2025/
Time Published: 2025-08-28T08:00:00Z

by Mathew Broughton on 28th Aug 2025 in News With Autumn and ATS London on the horizon, ExchangeWire research lead Mat Broughton takes stock (if you'll pardon the pun) of company financials across the media and marketing ecosystem. A solid quarter overall for our monitored advertising technology companies, however subsequent volatility suggests headwinds for the remainder of the year. As we track to the start of the calendar month, the chart above does not account for the post-results hit to The Trade Desk, which took a near 40% thumping in terms of its share price off of a deceleration in growth. Despite reaping recent rewards with its continued championing of the open web, investors panicked over competition from the likes of Amazon. As summarised by Madison & Wall, “Long-term optimism around the opportunity from the open web for The Trade Desk continues to seem unfounded to us[...] As well uncertainties abound around the mix of revenue trends for the company from data vs. technology fees.” Ouch. This had a knock-on effect on the rest of the sector, with Zeta, MNTN, Magnite, PubMatic and Viant, all seeing share price dips despite solid earnings. Simultaneously, we saw AppLovin continue its meteoric rise, despite ongoing scrutiny as to its practices. If The Trade Desk gets thumped for calling Amazon a potential partner, why does AppLovin avoid the hammer for wholly partnering with Meta whilst simultaneously acting as a parasite? This is all not to forget the latest flop in the flip-flop-flip-flop saga of Google deprecating third-party cookies across its Chrome browser, now deciding that users will no longer be offered the choice to use, or not use, the cookie. Where one door of uncertainty closes, another opens… The big tech and social platforms recorded astounding revenue growth across the board, particularly considering the age of some of these firms. Notably, Meta, Reddit, and Apple all exceeded earnings expectations despite Trump's tariffs and economic slowdown. Twas much of the same for Google parent Alphabet, as its third-party network business continues to stagnate, whilst YouTube goes gangbusters, achieving double-digit growth to reach USD$9.8bn (£7.2bn). Search revenue also continues to climb, bouldering 12% upwards to over USD$54bn (£39.9bn). Google claims that its AI search results monetise at the same rate as traditional search ads, despite these decimating publisher traffic, indicating these generate far fewer clicks, and comparatively showing far fewer ads within its AI Mode. I asked Google AI Mode to clarify:Righto. A highly tumultuous time across the agency landscape, with the public-listed holding groups exposed to the joint gales of AI and upstart independents. In recent months, we’ve seen a frankly aggressive period of client switching, with massive brand accounts switching hands nigh-on every week. Through this turbulence, Omnicom and IPG had a stable quarter ahead of the closure of their blockbuster merger. Further consolidation was seemingly on the cards, with Sir Martin Sorrell’s S4Capital mulling over a merger approach from private equity-backed MSQ Partners, only for the mooted acquirer to come out and say that they had not made an approach, nor would ever do so ever again. Savagery Publicis continues to fly, nabbing accounts aplenty at the expense of its rivals. I’ve used the phrase “mastering the narrative” a lot in recent months regarding Publicis, and they continue to do so, rightfully highlighting that scrutiny will shift onto Omnicom/IPG following the completion of their merger (much to the delight of beleaguered WPP). As industry expert Barry Dudley observed: "having an enemy, a Goliath to your David, is very commonly what drives people, drives businesses. This has been the environment that Publicis has been playing within." A mixed bag among the publisher set, with digital publishers and streaming providers seeing strong gains, whilst traditional linear TV publishers continue to face headwinds. Despite market challenges, UK publishers showed strong momentum, whilst audience targeting, first-party data strategies, and AI integration, all dominated earnings presentations. Consolidation has cooled in the segment, barring the merger between Nextar and Tegna, which seeks to solidify shaky foundations beneath the house of local TV across the US. Despite rampant speculation earlier in the year, gossip has quietened about a potential divestment of ITV Studios from the parent ITV business, however talks may still be ongoing on that front.

Title: Crystal Dynamics Announces Layoffs; New Tomb Raider Game Is Unaffected

A few hours ago, renowned developer Crystal Dynamics confirmed it was forced to perform a round of layoffs. However, the new Tomb Raider game project is unaffected. Here's the whole message that was posted on LinkedIn: Today, we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions. This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market. To those impacted - we recognize and thank you for your hard work, talent, and passion. We are committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition. To our teams, players, and partners, thank you for your continued support as we build a creative, sustainable, and resilient tomorrow together. This includes the future of Tomb Raider, which remains unaffected by this decision. The studio had been collaborating with The Initiative on the Perfect Dark remake that was canceled last month, so this could still be related to that decision taken by Microsoft. Crystal Dynamics, a studio headquartered in San Mateo, California, has been in the industry for over 33 years and is known primarily for Legacy of Kain, Gex, and of course, Tomb Raider. More recently, it released Marvel's Avengers, which largely failed to gain any traction despite the IP. In April 2022, we learned that the studio was working on a new installment in Lara Croft's franchise, powered by Unreal Engine 5 instead of Crystal Dynamics' proprietary Foundation Engine. A few months later, the studio announced that Amazon Games would publish the new title. Amazon later acquired the movie and series rights, with vague goals to create an interconnected universe that would also include the new games. We now know that Phoebe Waller-Bridge has been brought on to write and produce the series that will eventually air on Prime Video. As for the new Tomb Raider game, we last heard something official from Amazon Games head Christoph Hartmann, who said it wouldn't be too long before the project was shown to the public. That was in June 2024, though. Hopefully, we will get at least a trailer at the upcoming The Game Awards in December. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: Investors are looking at bargains in China, says HSBC investment boss, pushed by AI discounts and fears over Trump 2.0

Eleanor Pringle is an award-winning reporter at Fortune covering news, the economy, and personal finance. Eleanor previously worked as a business correspondent and news editor in regional news in the U.K. She completed her journalism training with the Press Association after earning a degree from the University of East Anglia. When President Trump returned to the White House his intention was clear: to make America great again. But the United States’ economic partners, and some of its rivals, are also benefiting from having the unorthodox showman back in the Oval Office. Investors are watching the U.S. stock market with both enthusiasm and trepidation: The S&P 500 is up 15% over the past year, Treasuries have remained relatively steady, and the Fed’s monetary policy is expected to begin a downward trajectory. But overlaying the strong fundamentals are questions: Is the soaring growth of Magnificent Seven stocks overvalued on the unfulfilled promises of AI? Will Trump’s unusual foreign policy materially damage the domestic economy? And where might the true winners of the artificial intelligence race emerge from? Increasingly, investors are answering those questions by diversifying into a key region, says Willem Sels, global chief investment officer for HSBC’s global private bank. That region is China. America continues to prove its economic resilience and earnings deliverables, Sels told Fortune in an exclusive interview, but geopolitical uncertainty is pushing investors toward balancing risk with other regions. Traditionally, the question of political influence over portfolios has centered on emerging markets, said Sels, but over the past few years that has moved into developed markets as well. As such, diversification has become more of a focus—particularly for business owners looking to spread risk between the economy they operate in and the assets used to protect their wealth. “When a client comes in the door … the first discussion is, ‘Please build a global portfolio. Maybe try to have as little as possible in your home country if you already have your business here, because that’s diversification,’” Sels said. “Clearly the debate over the last few months was about, Will there be diversification away from the U.S.? And there are a number of elements to that.” Part of the question is how dominant U.S. Big Tech has become in equity markets, with the Magnificent Seven stocks (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) providing most of the growth. As such, if these stocks hiccup it can have major ramifications for portfolios. “Clearly you potentially need to do something around that … to diversify,” Sels said. “We highlight things like, make sure that you don’t only have the growth stocks but have some value stocks, do some sector diversification, do some geographical diversification, and so on. “The other thing that triggered that diversification discussion obviously was the rapid policy changes in the U.S., and the growth of the debt pile, which led people to ask the question, ‘Is there a de-dollarization story? And what does that mean in terms of my portfolio and other people’s portfolio?’ What we’ve seen in the data is that there have been two months or so where there were some outflows out of bonds and equity markets, but that has not lasted—to a large extent because policy has become a little bit clearer.” “People are adding a little bit to other regions, adding a little bit to other sectors to be less concentrated in the U.S. market, but they are not fleeing away from it,” Sels continued. “There was enthusiasm for European stocks, but it was very short-lived. The Asian investors, over the last 15 [to] 20 years that I’ve been going there, find it very hard to get excited about Europe.” Part of the problem is that these investors don’t see as many new or emerging companies that could materially change the European economy, and there’s also the issue of brand recognition beyond companies like LVMH and BMW, Sels said. “This is the first time that we’re again seeing flows from Europe into China,” Sels added. “That is to a large extent because of the AI trade that people want to play, and then secondly this concept of anti-involution … with the supply-side reforms which would address the issue of overcapacity, therefore the deflation issue and therefore the earnings growth, because what you have in China is a lot of very competitive companies … therefore they have no pressing power, and therefore earnings growth has been reasonably weak.” China has signaled a shift in priorities to address involution, with the country’s Central Finance and Economic Affairs Commission telling President Xi Jinping in a meeting last month that Beijing must “focus on key and difficult issues, regulate enterprises’ disorderly and low-price competition,” and “guide enterprises to improve product quality and promote the orderly exit of outdated production capacity.” Beijing is no stranger to the issue. In 2015 the government launched similar actions to address overcapacity, particularly in key regions like steel and coal, in order to boost corporate profitability. Flash-forward to 2025 and “they’re now addressing that,” Sels said. “Therefore we think that earnings expectations will go up … One of the main obstacles for our clients had been the belief that [Chinese companies are] over-competing, and therefore your earnings are not there, the economic growth is potentially there, but your earnings are not there. “That’s now changing. So we’re seeing flows back and obviously also encouraged by ‘How can I diversify my big U.S. trunk of assets?’” With discussions about diversification out of the U.S. remaining active, China seems to have emerged as the region to balance that risk, Sels said. And Beijing’s typically lower share prices also offer the category of the moment, AI, at a bargain. In a note published last week, HSBC said that within the AI ecosystem, infrastructure stocks are outperforming enablers and adopters—at 22.2% versus 11.3% and 13.5% since July. Indeed, this week Chinese chipmaker Cambricon Technologies briefly became the country’s most expensive stock, surging 10% on Wednesday to 1,465 yuan ($204.62). At the time of writing, the share price has dropped back but is up 112% for the year to date. And while Cambricon exemplifies the more expensive end of the scale, Sels highlights that other equivalents to U.S. stocks can be found at a “30% to 40% discount.” “We’re basically saying, ‘Listen, don’t just look at the chips makers but also look at the guys that build out the infrastructure around it. The guys that build out the energy, the electricity supply around it, the robotics and automation, where it is not just a matter of, we move the data a little bit—this is real, big innovation.’ And so by diversifying throughout the AI ecosystem, I think you address a little bit of the question about valuations.” China’s stock market is soaring: The SSE Composite Index is up 33.4% over the past year, while the S&P 500 is up 14.9%. While the growth in China is marked, HSBC’s research points out U.S. AI-related capital expenditure (driven by the “Big Four” of Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta, along with Stargate and other private companies) is surpassing that of China’s “Big Four” (Alibaba, ByteDance, Tencent, and Baidu, as well as telecom services companies) by eight- to 10-fold. Moreover, HSBC’s research adds: “U.S. firms achieve higher returns on AI capex, with cloud platforms generating significantly more revenue than their Chinese counterparts—close to USD $400 billion in the U.S. vs. USD $60 billion in China in 2024, according to Statista.” So while clients may be balancing against overreliance on American companies, Sels said, the upside fundamentals of the U.S. remain strong—enough to take recession off the table. Indeed, while blips in tech stocks recently led to questions over an AI bubble, the HSBC boss remained bullish: “We certainly think that that AI liftoff is structural in nature.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Chip giant Nvidia’s sales rise 56% in boost for AI boom

US chipmaker reports revenue of $46.74bn for second quarter, defying fears that AI may be overhyped. By John Power Chip giant Nvidia has set a new sales record, a sign that demand for artificial intelligence remains strong despite fearsthe technology may be overhyped. Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company, on Wednesday reported revenue of $46.74bn for the three months that ended in July, a rise of 56 percent year-on-year. Profit for the quarter was $26.42bn, a yearly rise of 59 percent. Nvidia’s latest earnings report had been hotly anticipated as the tech giant is widely seen as a barometer of the AI boom, which has lifted the US stock market from all-time high to all-time high. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that production of Blackwell Ultra, Nvidia’s latest platform using its most advanced chips, was ramping up “at full speed” and demand for the company’s products was “extraordinary”. “The AI race is on, and Blackwell is the platform at its centre,” Jensen said. Looking ahead, the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant predicted revenue of $54bn, plus or minus 2 percent, for the July-September quarter, which would be slightly above market expectations. Despite the robust results, Nvidia’s stock price fell more than 3 percent in after-hours trading, an indication of the sky-high expectations attached to the chipmaker, which is valued at more than $4.4 trillion. Nvidia’s sales notably did not include any shipments to China, whose market is subject to US government export controls intended to blunt Beijing’s ability to develop AI. US President Donald Trump’s administration earlier this month lifted a ban on sales of Nvidia’s H20 chip, which was designed specifically for the Chinese market, following concerted lobbying by Huang. As part of its agreement with the Trump administration, Nvidia agreed to pay the US government 15 percent of revenues from chip sales in China. The lifting of the ban on the H20 raises the possibility that Nvidia could have potentially enormous untapped sales potential in the world’s second-largest economy, though its prospects have been complicated by a recent directive by Beijing urging local firms against doing business with the company. “Just imagine what will happen to this stock if the China business even comes half back to life,” The Kobeissi Letter, a newsletter following capital markets, said. “Jensen Huang will undoubtedly be working overtime on the China situation. The AI Revolution is in full swing.” Fuelled by explosive demand for its AI, Nvidia’s revenue has grown at breakneck speed over the past two years. The company posted triple-digit revenue growth for five straight quarters between mid-2023 and 2024. Since the start of 2023, the price of Nvidia shares has multiplied more than 11 times over, with the stock up more than 30 percent so far this year. The firm’s stellar performance, underpinned by multibillion-dollar AI investments by tech giants including Microsoft, Meta and Amazon, has stoked discussion about whether AI could be in a bubble. In an interview with The Verge earlier this month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who oversaw the release of the groundbreaking AI model ChatGPT, said he believed that investors were “overexcited” about the technology.

The S&P 500 achieved a record high close ahead of Nvidia's quarterly results, a key event testing the AI rally's valuation. While Nvidia's stock dipped slightly, its significant S&P 500 weighting makes its financial performance crucial. Investors are also monitoring potential interest rate cuts and political developments, including Trump's attempt to replace a Federal Reserve Governor. The S&P 500 posted 28 new highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 127 new highs and 35 new lows.

Title: "This decision was not made lightly" — Tomb Raider dev Crystal Dynamics hit by "necessary" layoffs for second time this year, and I'm sick of writing this headline

Crystal Dynamics is going through another layoff wave after already facing cuts earlier in 2025. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Waves of layoffs in the gaming industry continue to hit developers and publishers around the world, with Crystal Dynamics — the studio best known for its work as the steward of the legendary action-adventure franchise Tomb Raider — being the latest team to be affected. The developer announced the news on Wednesday afternoon on LinkedIn, confirming that "a number of our talented colleagues" were let go from the company in response to "evolving business conditions." "Today we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions," reads the studio's post. "This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market." Notably, Crystal Dynamics has vowed to do everything it can to help affected employees in the wake of these layoffs, though it hasn't publicly mentioned any specific types of aid or compensation. "To those impacted — we recognize and thank you for your hard work, talent, and passion. We are committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition," it said. The studio concluded its statement with appreciation for the support offered by its teams, business partners, and players, also noting that the Tomb Raider franchise is supposedly "unaffected" by the cuts. "To our teams, players, and partners, thank you for your continued support as we build a creative, sustainable, and resilient tomorrow together. This includes the future of Tomb Raider, which remains unaffected by this decision," reads the end of the notice. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. At present, it's unclear how many Crystal Dynamics workers have been affected by this latest wave of layoffs, or which specific divisions of the studio, if any, have been affected more than others. It's the second round of layoffs that the developer has gone through this year, with 17 workers also cut from the company in late March. Then, like now, it commented that the discharges were "necessary," and came due to a need to "better align our current business needs and the studio's future success." It's important to highlight that Crystal Dynamics is owned by Embracer Group, a massive Swedish video game holding firm infamous for the large number of layoffs and studio closures that have occurred under its wing. Much of the company's troubles in recent years have been attributed to the collapse of a critical $2 billion deal in 2022 that the firm was banking on, leading to share prices dropping by 40% in the aftermath. The developer is currently working on an untitled Tomb Raider game published by Amazon Games. It was also collaborating with Xbox studio The Initiative on the Perfect Dark reboot, though the partnership ended when Microsoft shuttered The Initiative and the Perfect Dark project in July. These new cuts at Crystal Dynamics are yet another instance of the layoffs that have swept through the gaming industry throughout the last several years, with roughly 40,000 developers in total affected. From Microsoft and Xbox, to Metal Gear Solid Delta's Virtuos Games, to Little Nightmares' Supermassive Games, to Destiny 2's Bungie, to Marvel Rivals' NetEase Games, these cuts have absolutely ravaged the industry, leaving thousands of hard-working developers out of work. The layoffs themselves have been largely attributed to overinvestment in gaming during the pandemic, with inflated interest in the industry lowering once stay-at-home mandates were lifted and daily life returned to normalcy. Wider global economic shifts are also a factor, as are rising game development costs. Though there's hope for a recovery in the near future, it's always harrowing to be met with the news of layoffs like these again and again, and frustrating to have to write this type of headline again and again, as well. For the sake of the people behind the creation of the games we love, I can only sincerely hope that the industry levels out as soon as it can. My heart, and the heart of everyone here at Windows Central, goes out to any and all developers affected by these layoffs and any others.

This is the third round of layoffs in two years When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Crystal Dynamics has announced yet another round of layoffs, its third since the studio was acquired by Embracer Group in 2022. The news comes in the wake of the cancellation of Perfect Dark, which Crystal Dynamics was developing alongside Xbox studio The Initiative. "Today we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions," the studio says in a LinkedIn post (via GamesIndustry.biz). "This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market." The post concludes by noting that development of the next Tomb Raider "remains unaffected by this decision." Very little about the game has been revealed since it was announced in 2022, other than the fact that it's in development on Unreal Engine 5 and will be published by Amazon Games. Crystal Dynamics did not disclose how many people were affected by today's layoffs. The company laid off 17 employees earlier this year, citing the need to "better align our current business needs and the studio’s future success." A further 10 people were laid off in 2023, that time to "align the studio with our current business needs." I guess the layoff form letters don't change much over the years. The last new game from Crystal Dynamics launched in 2020, while the studio was still a subsidiary of Square Enix. That game was Marvel's Avengers, a live-service mishap that launched to mediocre reviews and eventually shut down in 2023. The studio has contributed to some remaster projects, including Tomb Raider and Legacy of Kain, in recent years, but we're all still waiting to see what its next big game is.

Despite uncertainty about trade with China, Nvidia forecasts it will take in even more money than analysts expected in three months' time. Business and economics reporter @taaffems Thursday 28 August 2025 07:26, UK The world's most valuable company, and first to be valued at $4trn (£2.9trn), beat market expectations in keenly anticipated financial results. Microchip maker Nvidia recorded revenues of $46.7bn (£34.6bn) in just three months up to July, latest financial data from the company showed, slightly better than Wall Street observers had expected. The company's performance is seen as a bellwether for artificial intelligence (AI) demand, with investors paying close attention to see whether the hype is overblown or if significant investment will pay off. Originally a creator of gaming graphics hardware, Nvidia's chips help power AI capability - and the UK's most powerful supercomputer. Nvidia's graphics processors underpin products such as ChatGPT from OpenAI and Gemini from Google. Other tech giants - Microsoft, Meta and Amazon - make up Nvidia's biggest customers and are paying large sums to embed AI into their products. Why does it matter? Nvidia has been central to the boom in AI development and the surge in tech stock valuations, which has seen stock markets reach record highs. It represents about 8% of the value of the US S&P 500 stock market index of companies relied on to be stable and profitable. Strong results will continue to fuel record highs in the market. Conversely, results that fail to live up to the hype could trigger a market tumble.

Its value impacts anyone with cash in the US stock market, such as pension funds. The S&P 500 rose 14% over the past year, and the tech-company-heavy NASDAQ gained 21%, largely thanks to Nvidia. As such, its earnings can move markets as much as major economic or monetary policy announcements, like an interest rate decision. What next? Revenue rises are forecast to continue to rise as Nvidia said it expected a rise to roughly $54bn (£40bn) in the next three months, more than the $53.14bn (£39.3bn) anticipated by analysts. This excludes any potential shipments to China as export of Nvidia's H20 chip, designed with the Biden administration's export crackdown on advanced AI powering chips in mind, had been banned under US national security grounds. But in recent weeks, Nvidia and another chipmaker, AMD, reached an unprecedented agreement to pay the Trump administration a 15% portion of China sales in return for export licences to send chips to China. There were no H20 sales at all to China in the second quarter of the year, the period for which results were released on Wednesday evening. Previously, 13% of Nvidia's revenue came from China, with nearly 50% coming from the US. Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free Market reaction Despite the expectation-beating results, Nvidia shares were down by up to 3% in after-hours trading, as the massive revenue rises previously booked by the company were not repeated in the latest quarter, fuelling fears of a more persistent slowdown in growth ahead. Compared to a year ago, revenues rose 56% and 6% compared to the three months up to April. The absence of Chinese sales in forecasts appeared to disappoint. But Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: "Smart investors will look through the noise. Nvidia has traded flat or down after results in four of the past five quarters, only to do all the heavy lifting after markets have had time to digest the results. "The law of large numbers seems irrelevant here - despite its scale, Nvidia continues to defy expectations as consensus underestimates the opportunity at hand. Third-quarter revenue guidance at $54bn is a strong number, especially when it factors in no benefit from Chinese sales."

Title: AI Bubble 2027

Time Published: 2025-08-27T14:37:21Z
Full Content:
Soundtrack: The Dillinger Escape Plan - One Of Us Is The Killer An MIT study found that 95% of organizations are getting "zero return" from generative AI, seemingly every major outlet is now writing an "are we in a bubble?" story, and now Meta has frozen AI hiring. Things are looking bleak for the AI bubble, and people are getting excited that this loathsome, wasteful era might be coming to an end. As a result, I'm being asked multiple times a day when the bubble might burst. I admit I'm hesitant to make any direct timelines — we are in a time (to quote former Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan) of irrational exuberance, where the markets have oriented themselves around something very silly and very, very expensive. Regardless, Anthropic is apparently raising as much as $10 billion in its next funding round, and OpenAI allegedly hit $1 billion in revenue in July, which brings it in line with my estimate that it’s made about $5.26 billion in revenue in 2025 so far, The bubble "bursting" is not Sam Altman declaring that we're in a bubble — it's a series of events that lead to big tech pulling away from this movement, investment money drying up, and the current slate of AI companies withering and dying because they can't raise more money, can't go public, and can't sell to anybody. Anyway, earlier in the year, a bunch of credulous oafs wrote an extremely long piece of fan fiction called "AI 2027," beguiling people like Kevin Roose with its "gloominess." Written with a deep seriousness and a lot of charts, AI 2027 makes massive leaps of logic, with its fans rationalizing taking it seriously by saying that the five authors "have the right credentials." In reality, AI 2027 is written to fool people that want to be fooled and scare people that are already scared, its tone consistently authoritative as it suggests that a self-learning agent is on the verge of waking up, a thing that is so remarkably stupid that anyone who took this seriously should be pantsed again and again. These men are also cowards. They choose to use fake company names like "OpenBrain" to mask their predictions instead of standing behind them with confidence. I get that extrapolating years into the future is scary — but these grifting losers can't even commit to a prediction! Nevertheless, I wanted to take a run at something similar myself, though not in the same narrative format. In this piece, I'm going to write out what conditions I believe will burst the bubble. Some of this will be extrapolations based on my own knowledge, sources, and writing hundreds of thousands of words on this subject. I am not going to write a strict timeline, but I am going to write how some things could go, and how (and why) they'll lead to the bubble bursting. For the bubble to burst, I see a few necessary conditions, though reality is often far more boring and annoying. Regardless, it's important to know that this is a bubble driven by vibes not returns, and thus the bubble bursting will be an emotional reaction. This post is, in many respects, a follow-on to my previous “pale horse” article (called Burst Damage). Many of my original pale horses have already come true — Anthropic and OpenAI have pushed price increases and rate limits, there is already discord in AI investment, Meta is already considering downsizing its AI team, and OpenAI has done multiple different "big, stupid magic tricks," the chief of them being the embarrassing launch of GPT-5, a "smart, efficient router" that I reported last week was quite the opposite. This time, I'm going to write out the linchpin events that will shock the system, and how they might bring about the bubble bursting. I should also be clear, and I will get to after the premium break, that this will be a series of events rather than one big one, though there are big ones to look out for. I also think it might "take a minute," because "the bubble bursting" will be a succession of events that could take upwards of a year to fully happen. That’s been true for every bubble. Although people associate the implosion of the housing bubble with the “one big event” of Lehman Brothers collapsing in 2008, the reality is that it was preceded and followed by a bunch of other events, equally significant though not quite as dramatic. One VC (who you'll read about shortly) predicted it will take 6 quarters to run out of funding entirely based on the current rate of investment, putting us around February 2027 for things to have truly collapsed. Here's a list of some of the things that I believe will have to happen for this era to be truly done, and the ones that I believe are truly essential. The common thread through all of these points is that they are predominantly impossible to ignore. So far this bubble has inflated because the problems with AI — such as "it doesn't make any money" and "burns billions of dollars" — have been dismissed until very recently as the necessary costs of the beautiful AI revolution. Now that things have begun to unravel, the intensity of criticism will increase gradually, rather than in one big movement that makes everyone say "we hate AI." And it isn't just because of the money. CEOs like Tobias Lutke of Shopify have oriented their companies’ entire culture around AI, demanding in his case that "employees must demonstrate why AI cannot be used before requesting additional resources." Generative AI is, on some level, a kind of dunce detector — its flimsy and vague use cases having enough juice to impress the clueless Business Idiots who don't really engage with the production that makes their companies money. The specious, empty hype of Large Language Models — driven by a tech and business media that has given up on trying to understand them — symbolizes a kind of magic to these empty-headed goobers, and unwinding their "AI-first" cultures will be difficult...right up until the first guy does it, at which point everybody will follow. AI has taken such a hold on our markets because it's symbolic of a few things: In any case, I am going to try and write the things that I think will happen, in detail. I'll go into more conditions in this piece, and as discussed, I'm going to make some informed guesses, extrapolations, and give my thoughts about how things collapse. I predict that the impact of Large Language Models over the next decade will be enormous, not in its actual innovation or returns, but in its ability to expose how little our leaders truly know about the world or labor, how willing many people are to accept whatever the last thing a smart-adjacent person said, and how our markets and economy are driven by people with the most tenuous grasp on reality. This will be an attempt to write down what I believe could happen in the next 18 months, the conditions that might accelerate the collapse, and how the answers to some of my open questions — such as how these companies book revenue and burn compute — could influence outcomes.

Title: Serve Robotics’ Target Of Deploying 2,000 Level 4 Autonomous Urban Delivery Robots By Year End Is Now Attracting Wall Street’s Attention

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The age of robots is neigh, and the market is currently sifting through the available players to sniff out those with an intrinsic advantage. Enter Serve Robotics, whose partnership with NVIDIA and Uber demands a prominent place in the last-mile urban delivery space. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Serve Robotics is currently pioneering 4-wheeled robots that leverage AI to navigate dense cityscape. These third-gen robots support advanced sensing tech and copious onboard computing resources, thanks to NVIDIA's Jetson Orin module. Of course, NVIDIA had precipitated a significant rally in Serve Robotics' stock in 2024 when it took a 10 percent stake in the company. Interestingly, NVIDIA divested the entirety of its stake in Q4 2024. Do note that Serve Robotics is currently partnered with Uber Eats to offer autonomous food deliveries in US cities such as Los Angeles. In the second quarter of 2025, the company deployed 120 delivery robots, bringing its total fleet strength to 400. Critically, Serve Robotics intends to expand its robot fleet size by 400 percent to 2,000 units by the end of 2025. Wedbush starts Serve Robotics $SERV at Outperform with a $15 PT — about 46% upside from here. Calls out strength in its autonomous delivery platform tied to AI growth. Shares sold off after $NVDA trimmed its stake, but Uber still holds ~8% and remains a key partner. It is this aggressive growth spurt that is now attracting Wall Street's attention. For instance, Wedbush has just initiated its coverage on the stock with a $15 stock price target, implying a 35 percent upside from the current price levels. Similarly, earlier in August, Cantor Fitzgerald reiterated its overweight rating on Serve Robotics shares, replete with a $17 stock price target. Serve Robotics announced $642,000 in revenue in Q2 2025, which corresponds to an annual growth rate of 46 percent. The company's strong liquidity position of $183 million (as of the end of Q2) has played an important role in aiding its hyper-aggressive expansion efforts. The company is also tapping into multiple revenue streams. For instance, it is selling advertising space on its delivery robots, allowing advertisers to gain visibility as these delivery robots become an increasingly common sight on urban walkways. Serve Robotics has a low-cost CapEx model, where it outsources the actual manufacturing of its iconic robots to Magna. Cantor Fitzgerald expects the company to price its delivery services at a more competitive sub-$8 price point, allowing a break-even period of less than 2 years for each robot.

Title: Buy MSFT Stock At $500?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has been one of the top performers this year, with its stock climbing 20%. This is well ahead of the broader market, where the S&P 500 has risen 10%, while peers like Amazon are up only 4%, and Google has gained less than 10%. This strong performance is primarily driven by rapid cloud growth and sustained momentum in AI adoption. Microsoft's leadership in the expanding AI sector has clearly boosted investor confidence. At a current price of more than $500, is MSFT stock still attractive? We believe it is. Our evaluation of Microsoft across Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows a company with excellent operating results and a strong financial position, as outlined below. That being said, if you want upside potential with less volatility than holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—delivering returns of over 91% since launch. Also, see – Ethereum Play: BMNR Stock To $100? On a sales or profit basis, MSFT stock appears very expensive relative to the broader market. Microsoft’s revenues have expanded meaningfully over the past few years. Microsoft’s profit margins are significantly stronger than most peers in the Trefis universe. Microsoft’s balance sheet appears extremely strong. MSFT stock has fared slightly better than the S&P 500 during certain downturns. Concerned about downturn risks? Our dashboard Will You Be Comfortable Buying Microsoft Stock? offers a detailed view of how MSFT performed during past market crashes. In summary, Microsoft’s performance across the parameters is: • Growth: Strong • Profitability: Very Strong • Financial Stability: Very Strong • Downturn Resilience: Strong • Overall: Strong Microsoft has delivered across all dimensions, justifying its premium valuation. At around $500 per share, the stock trades at 37x trailing earnings, slightly above its four-year average P/E of 35. We believe this premium is warranted, with more upside possible. This view is supported by strong Azure sales and rising profitability, as its operating margin increased from 41.8% in 2023 to 45.2% now. Of course, we could be wrong in our assessment, and investors may hesitate to pay a higher premium. But if you believe in AI-driven growth and have a 3–5 year horizon, Microsoft remains a compelling stock. Remember, individual stock investing carries risks. Trefis’ High Quality (HQ) Portfolio—a basket of 30 stocks—has outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years, delivering better returns with lower risk. See HQ Portfolio performance metrics for details.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSEAMERICAN: BMNR) has surged 600% year-to-date, holding the world’s largest corporate Ethereum position of 1.7 million ETH valued at $8 billion. This far exceeds other corporate ETH holders, giving the company unmatched leverage to Ethereum price movements. With continued purchases underscoring management’s conviction, traditional metrics like revenue or margins become secondary—this is pure cryptocurrency exposure on a massive scale. But can the stock double again from here? The answer is yes. Below, we outline the potential drivers behind such a move. That said, if you want upside potential with less volatility than an individual stock, take a look at the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—delivering more than 91% returns since inception. Also see – MongoDB: Up 30% Is MDB Stock Still A Buy? BitMine’s holding of 1.7 million ETH provides interesting opportunities, including strategic initiatives and institutional partnerships, that smaller holders cannot achieve. Ongoing purchases reinforce management’s confidence and bolster its leverage with crypto infrastructure providers. For the stock to double, two factors must align: Ethereum must appreciate in value, and the company must manage its treasury effectively. While the upside is immense, the risks scale equally. For instance, the stock once lost 88% of its value during the 2022 downturn. Ultimately, BitMine delivers unmatched Ethereum exposure through the public markets. But success depends almost entirely on the cryptocurrency’s trajectory, not traditional business fundamentals. Keep in mind, investing in individual stocks—especially those tied to cryptocurrencies—carries substantial risk. For broader exposure, explore the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a strong record of outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why? HQ Portfolio stocks have typically offered higher returns with less volatility than the benchmark—delivering a smoother ride, as seen in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Chipmaker Nvidia is poised to release a quarterly report that could provide a better sense of whether the stock market has been riding an overhyped artificial intelligence bubble or is being propelled by a technological boom that’s still gathering mome... SAN FRANCISCO -- Chipmaker Nvidia will release a quarterly report Wednesday that could provide a better sense of whether the stock market has been riding an overhyped artificial intelligence bubble or is being propelled by a technological boom that's still gathering momentum. Nvidia become the first publicly traded company to surpass a market value of $4 trillion last month, and its stock price has gained another 13% since then to create an additional $500 billion in shareholder wealth. The latest financial results are due out Wednesday afternoon. They have become a key AI barometer during the past two years because Nvidia makes most of the chips that power the technology in vast data centers at the center of the boom. This summer's run-up has continued Nvidia's jaw-dropping rise from early 2023, when the company's market value was hovering around $400 billion. That was shortly after OpenAI's late 2022 release of its ChatGPT chatbot triggered the biggest craze in technology since Apple released the first iPhone in 2007. While the technology industry has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI frenzy, it's also been a boon for the overall stock market. The benchmark S&P 500 has gained 68% since the end of 2022, with AI fervor fueling much of the investor optimism. But even amid the general euphoria, there recently have been murmurs about whether AI mania will prove to be an echo of the late 1990s dot-com boom that culminated in an excruciating stock market meltdown in 2000 that eventually drove the U.S. economy and plunged Silicon Valley into a funk that lasted several years before the tech industry began to thrive again. Investors were recently spooked by a combination of an MIT report that said 95% of AI pilots fail and comments from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman floating the idea that the artificial intelligence market is in a bubble. And by some metrics, the stock prices of tech companies at the AI are looking frothy. For instance, Nvidia is trading at about 40 times its future earnings, roughly double the rate that investors traditionally believe is a reasonable level. Meanwhile, the market value of Microsoft, another AI leader, is hovering just below $4 trillion, while the values of other fellow pacesetters Amazon, Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Google parent Alphabet currently range from $1.9 trillion to $2.5 trillion. Nvidia is expected to post another quarter of robust growth for the May-July period of its fiscal year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet research predict Nvidia will earn $1.01 per share, excluding certain items unrelated to its ongoing business, which would be a 49% increase from the same time last year. The analysts anticipated Nvidia's revenue would rise 53% from a year ago to about $46 billion. Those gains reflect the financial tsunami flooding the AI market as the biggest players spend heavily to build and expand data centers needed to power the technology. Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta are collectively budgeting more than $325 billion for investments in AI this year. With its dominant position in the AI chip market, Nvidia is reaping the benefits of that intense demand. Even so, the trajectory of Nvidia's growth has been tapering off. If analyst projections pan out, Nvidia's revenue growth for its latest quarter will be significantly lower than the 122% increase it posted during the same period last year. And Nvidia has also been losing business because of President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Following a ban on its AI chip sales in China, which resulted in a $4.5 billion blow to its finances during its fiscal first quarter, Nvidia estimated that the restrictions would cost it about approximately $8 billion in sales in this during the past quarter.

Title: Trump’s Tariff Tidal Wave Could Drown This Coconut Water Juggernaut

BySergei Klebnikov, Forbes Staff. What do you do when 96% of your revenue comes from coconut water and 100% of your supply comes from tropical countries targeted by Donald Trump with high tariffs? This is exactly the situation confronting one of the nation’s hottest small cap companies today, $516 million (revs) Vita-Coco of New York City, the leading maker of coconut water. Its biggest source of coconuts, has heretofore been Brazil, a country now squarely in the crosshairs of a proposed 50% tariff, courtesy of the Trump administration. Its six other sources for coconuts aren’t much better: Philippines (tariff: 19%), Malaysia (19%), Vietnam (20%), Indonesia (19%) Thailand (19%) and Sri Lanka (20%). Still, you wouldn’t know that Vita Coco was facing a Trump tariff nightmare given the company’s bullish tone—or its stock performance. Shares are up nearly 32% over the past 12 months, outperforming many better-known consumer-staples names. Even with the stock down roughly 5% year-to-date as the broader market rallies, Wall Street is shrugging off Vita Coco’s inevitable pricing pressure. “Brazil is really a nonissue for us [if enacted],” insists co-founder and executive chairman Michael Kirban. “We started working on reallocating our Brazil supply, which historically goes to the United States, to supply Europe and Canada, several weeks ago.” The main source of supply for Europe, meanwhile—the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Malaysia—will now all shift to the U.S. “This is something we can pull the trigger on really quickly,” reasons Kirban, seemingly unconcerned about the high tariffs in his alternative source countries. He goes on: “With decreasing ocean freight rates and pricing [increases] we took earlier this year to mitigate the initial 10% baseline tariffs, we think we are in a good position.” Co-founder Kirban says he doesn’t expect to pass any further price hikes in the coming months, but this may be wishful thinking if Trump doesn't back away from his harsh tariffs on tropical countries. Here is what Vita Coco CEO Martin Roper said on the Q2 earnings call held a few weeks ago: “Our planned U.S.-based price increase in May to cover inflationary cost of goods pressures produced an approximately 7% increase at U.S. food retailers according to Circana over the quarter.” However the May price increase does not include another recent price increase implemented in the current quarter, which Vita Coco management refuses to provide Forbes details on. For now, Wall Street is putting its faith in Vita Coco management. By working with seven of the largest coconut processors in the world, Vita Coco currently controls roughly 40% of the U.S. coconut-water market, far ahead of smaller competitors like Goya and Harmless Harvest. “Coca-Cola tried to enter this market, buying Zico, and Pepsi also failed,” Larry Carlin, an equity analyst at $8 billion (assets) Conestoga Capital Advisors who is hopeful that Vita Coco’s strong position will give it more flexibility in the face of looming tariffs. “They’ve developed a supply chain with substantial barriers to entry,” adds Carlin. Founded by two friends in 2003 after a chance bar room encounter in Manhattan, Vita Coco’s met with early success in its first decade, thanks in part to celebrity investors including Madonna, Demi Moore, and Matthew McConaughey. However about a decade into their journey growing pains hit—thin margins, distribution hiccups and a rocky 2021 IPO kept many institutions away. But over the past two years the company has executed a disciplined turnaround, tightening its supply chain after the Covid pandemic. It has also expanded its portfolio of offerings into protein-infused PWR LIFT, aluminum-canned Ever & Ever water, and most recently, the coconut-milk-based beverage line Vita Coco Treats. Up until the onslaught of Trump’s tariffs, Vita-Coco was the envy of the Russell 2000, appearing near the top of Forbes Best Small Companies ranking in 2024. The stock is up 133% since its IPO, and five-fold from its low in 2022. On the company’s second quarter earnings call, held July 30th, CFO Corey Baker noted that Vita Coco is pursuing a formal tariff exemption request with U.S. trade officials. If that isn’t granted, management basically told shareholders to brace themselves: “If [the 50% Brazilian tariff is] enacted, we would ultimately need to pass through price increases,” says Baker. “Even under a worst-case scenario, we believe we could pass through price if necessary while maintaining share.” On Wall Street, six of the ten analysts covering Vita Coco rate it a “buy”, while the other four give it a “hold” rating, often interpreted as “sell” by investors. Short sellers have begun to circle its stock. A 23-page March 2025 report by UK-based short-seller NINGI Research accused Vita Coco of numerous underlying business problems including failed attempts at diversification, supply chain foul ups and millions in CEO and insider stock sales. NINGI’s main argument was that the company was an unsustainable growth story: “Vita Coco is nothing more than a one-trick pony" and an "operational basket case,” it wrote. The report's most impactful claims were that Vita Coco had lost its large private-label contract with Costco due to supply chain mismanagement, which would lead to a significant revenue hit. While Vita Coco publicly refuted the report as containing "inaccuracies and mischaracterizations," subsequent public statements and financial results support NINGI’s allegations about the lost Costco contract. The company's Q2 2025 earnings report confirmed a significant 36.5% decline in private-label sales. Today, a 12-pack of Costco's own in-house private label brand, Kirkland Signature coconut water, sells for $12.99 versus $19.59 for a 12 pack of Vita Coco at Target. Vita Coco has also publicly acknowledged that inventory constraints in 2024 led to "unacceptable private label service levels." Despite these issues, Vita Coco bulls maintain that the company’s core branded coconut water business is strong. Ever the optimist, Kirban is unfazed. “Sales are continuing to perform really nicely. So I think consumers are willing to pay,” says Kirban, referring to his tariff related price hikes. “This is a product that comes from a tree. It's not created in a lab, and it is three and a half times the electrolytes of the leading sport drink.”

Title: Will AI Be the Next Dot-Com Bubble?

As AI continues to rake in funds despite questions about long-term profitability, some experts are calling for more diversification. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com Is it time for investors to slow their AI roll? Some experts think so. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made headlines last week when he described the AI craze as a bubble. Combined with ChatGPT-5’s botched rollout earlier this month and some signs of sliding among tech stocks, that prompted investors to question whether the AI boom is set to go bust in the near future, like the dot-com bubble of the late ’90s. Still, AI-focused ETFs continue to hit the market, with VettaFi listing 48 in its database, and expert outlooks are mixed. “I think it’s important to be aware of the risk,” said Claire Cantalupo, senior market analyst at InvesTech Research. “It doesn’t necessarily mean AI is going to crash tomorrow.” There are a few things to look for when evaluating a possible bubble, Cantalupo said. One is a paradigm shift: a new technology or innovation leading to a surge in optimism and high valuations, with investors losing their sense of risk and reward. Another is “a universal belief that this time is different.” AI could, and probably will, change the world, she added, but it may also be causing inflated valuations that aren’t sustainable. During the dot-com boom, for example, equipment provider Cisco ranked as a major player, briefly becoming the world’s most valuable company with a market cap topping $500 billion. But it lost 90% of its value in the two years after the bubble burst in 2000. “The unfortunate reality is the top 10 companies in the S&P make up 40% of it by market capitalization,” Cantalupo said. “So investors who think they’re diversified by investing in index funds are actually far more exposed to just a small basket of stocks than they think they are.” Other potential indicators that the AI boom is a bubble include: Artificially Sweet. The S&P 500 continues to climb because of a few tech stocks — Nvidia, Meta and others — with massive AI projects. The projects could lead to too much hype, said Brian Colello, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. Meta, for instance, has reportedly offered huge compensation packages to AI engineers that could lose value if the company’s stock falls. Still, Colello expressed optimism, based in part on continued demand for Nvidia’s products. “Certainly, there will be businesses that fail to live up to lofty valuations and times where AI expands too quickly,” he said. “However, we don’t think these dynamics are plaguing the large AI leaders just yet.” There isn’t an ETF for everything, but the volume of leveraged products coming to market shows a strategy of filling any voids. Cash is king, but income-generating mutual funds and ETFs are increasingly being used for clients, Nasdaq found. The company’s massive asset moves may, in part, reflect institutional investors’ entry into the industry, particularly crypto. Meg Ryan, a lecturer at Harvard with a background in military law, will take over next month as director of the SEC Division of Enforcement. The latest ETFs from F/m Investments and Compoundr help institutional investors avoid taxes on income distributions. Crypto assets are increasingly available as spot ETFs like IBIT, and investors may have a fear of missing out, despite the volatility. ETF volatility plays a large role in the gap between returns for investors and for funds as a whole, Morningstar data show. A set of Vanguard funds subadvised by Wellington will mark the first active stock-picking ETFs in the company’s fleet. Energy demand is rising globally, in part because of AI use, and a handful of ETFs focused on nuclear energy stand to benefit. Cyclical industries can provide some regularity for ETF investors, but not without downsides. The filing marks President Trump’s latest move to bring his spot bitcoin strategy to the ETF market. Will advisors bite? Following revised jobs reports data, Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics head. His successor choice at the BLS may raise red flags. © 2025 The Daily Upside

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AB.fj5u93ykx Share article Print article To mark the 250th anniversary of her birth, we’re pitting Jane Austen’s much-loved novels against each other in a battle of wit, charm and romance. Six leading Austen experts have made their case for her ultimate novel, but the winner is down to you. Cast your vote in the poll at the end of the article, and let us know the reason for your choice in the comments. This is Jane Austen Fight Club – it’s bonnets at dawn… Championed by Lucy Thompson, lecturer in 19th-century literature and creative writing, Aberystwyth University Sense and Sensibility is Austen’s most quietly radical novel. As her first published work, it may be less polished than her later fiction, but it is no less incisive. It lays bare the emotional cost of living in a world governed by reputation, family obligation and gendered expectation. Excluded from inheritance and displaced from their home, the Dashwood sisters must navigate constant scrutiny. Through Elinor and Marianne, Austen dramatises two strategies for survival in a society obsessed with appearances. Born from an earlier epistolary draft, the novel retains a sharp interest in how information circulates and misleads. Gossip doesn’t just constrain; it distorts. Letters are spied upon, conversations overheard. Assumptions take on the weight of fact. In this world, everyone watches – but not everyone truly sees. Sense and Sensibility may wear a quieter face than Emma or Pride and Prejudice, but it is Austen’s sharpest early critique of how appearances govern lives. This article is part of a series commemorating the 250th anniversary of Jane Austen’s birth. Despite having published only six books, she is one of the best-known authors in history. These articles explore the legacy and life of this incredible writer. Championed by Andrew McInnes, reader in English literature, Edge Hill University Everyone already knows the best Austen novel: Pride and Prejudice. Why? Elizabeth Bennet. Lizzy is so charismatic that you might mistake the novel’s title for an abstract problem, and not Darcy’s pride versus her prejudice. We share her prejudices because Austen makes them so delicious. We roll our eyes at Mrs Bennet because Lizzy finds her exasperating. Wickham is seductive because he satisfies our inner bitch. And we fall in love with Darcy alongside Lizzy. Pride and Prejudice is the funniest and sexiest of Austen’s novels. In it, she allows herself a swoon-worthy romance without a hitch. Unlike Northanger Abbey’s Henry Tilney, Darcy doesn’t fall in love because Lizzy adores him, but falls first. Darcy is a complex man – shy, domineering, funny – and not a drip like Eds Ferrars (Sense and Sensibility) or Bertram (Mansfield Park). And unlike Emma, Lizzy builds healthy relationships with other women. Austen called Pride and Prejudice “too light and bright and sparkling” and joked that it could do with an essay on Walter Scott or Napoleon. But we know that would be a crime. It is just light and bright and sparkling enough to outshine the others. Championed by Amanda Vickery, professor in early modern history, Queen Mary University of London Pride and Prejudice is often the first grown-up novel young girls read, but Mansfield Park is the only Austen novel about a little girl growing up. All Austen’s fictions are versions of the female-centred courtship novel, usually covering a single year, with the heroine safely married to a deserving gentleman by the last page. Yet her heroines are mostly formed young women. Only in Mansfield Park do we meet our heroine as a little girl – and a puny and cowering little girl at that. Mansfield Park is Austen’s bildungsroman (the novel of becoming) on a par with that other girls’ classic, Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre (1847). Like poor, plain Jane, Fanny Price is a girl of no consequence – a Cinderella figure in a mansion of the rich and selfish. Fanny is shy, frail and physically timid, but she is not a moral coward. She learns to bear her lot with dignity, and to hold fast to what she believes. By volume three, Fanny is at last the centre of her own story. Mansfield Park is not just a love story, it is a life story. Championed by Ruvani Ranasinha, professor of global literature, King’s College London Emma Woodhouse is Jane Austen’s most vividly realised, proto-feminist heroine. Witty, clever and attractive, Emma is supremely self-confident and flawed. She challenges every expectation of female propriety and is full of contradictions: self-centred yet deeply attached to her hypochondriac, indulgent father; snobbish but kind. Emma revels in meddling in the romantic lives of others, especially her protégée, Harriet Smith. When her carefully laid plans unravel, the busybody makes mortifying mistakes and learns self-knowledge: “It darted through her with the speed of an arrow, that Mr Knightley must marry no-one but herself!” All Austen’s novels are shot through with the awareness of the role of wealth and class in marriage. But Emma – “an heiress of thirty thousand pounds” – is free from the intense competition among the women for young men with positions and prospects. At the same time, she attracts men like Mr Elton seeking women with landed connections and dowries. This is why the novel both responds to Austen’s historical moment and speaks to our own. Championed by Octavia Cox, departmental lecturer in English literature, University of Oxford Northanger Abbey is a riot of jokes. Nobody and nothing is spared: not the heroine, convention, society – even readers. There’s everything marvellous you’d expect from an Austen novel (sharp satire of patriarchy and socioeconomic weaponisation, laughter at human absurdity and pompousness, beautifully wrought witty expression, a rollicking good yarn, irony), but with extra sass. Its bombastic intrusive authorial narrative voice (perhaps the closest we get to Austen’s own), constantly makes in-jokes with readers about the action. It’s Austen’s most meta-fictional text, playing with readers’ expectations about novels (for example, joking that her novel, ironically, “is a new circumstance in romance” despite depicting nothing “new in common life”). Its “defence of the novel” passage is a proto-feminist rallying call-to-arms for female authors to celebrate each other’s work. Northanger Abbey’s meta-fictionality reveals much about Austen’s aim and style as an author, making it a must-read for all Austen-lovers. Oh, and it’s funny. Damned funny. Championed by Richard de Ritter, lecturer in English literature, University of Leeds Persuasion contains the greatest love letter in all English literature. It is the culmination of a slow-burning romance between the heroine, Anne Elliot, and Captain Frederick Wentworth, the man she has loved for eight long years. “You pierce my soul,” Wentworth writes to Anne with striking vulnerability: “I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late.” (Spoiler: he is not too late.) The brilliance of Persuasion lies in the depiction of its complex heroine. At 27, Anne Elliot is older and wiser than Austen’s earlier protagonists. Disregarded by her comically narcissistic family, the depth of Anne’s personality is revealed by Austen’s prose style, which is at its most luminous and expressive. Readers are plunged into the mind of the novel’s heroine. We witness her innermost thoughts and feelings as she negotiates the awkwardness, excitement and, finally, the sheer joy of embracing a future with Wentworth. Persuasion is the final novel that Austen completed before her death in 1817: she was at the peak of her powers. It is her most moving and her greatest work. Now the experts have made their case, it’s your turn to decide which of Austen’s six completed novels is her best work. Vote in the poll below to and see if our other readers agree with you.

Title: Fulfillment Compared: Amazon, Walmart, Shopify

Time Published: 2025-08-27T09:36:45Z

Ecommerce operators tired of picking, packing, and posting parcels can turn to massive marketplaces and the leading ecommerce platform for help. For years, Fulfillment by Amazon, Walmart Fulfillment Services, and the Shopify Fulfillment Network have helped sellers store inventory, ship orders, and even manage returns. The services share a common purpose of providing ecommerce order fulfillment but differ in structure, at least a little. Understanding those differences starts with a closer look at how each network works. FBA, SFN, and WFS aim to make ecommerce fulfillment fast and easy. Launched in 2006, FBA is the most recognized third-party fulfillment option on this list owing to its close association with the company’s marketplace. FBA’s most important feature may be exposure. Items sold on the Amazon Marketplace and fulfilled through FBA display the Prime badge on Amazon.com. The badge is important because about 75% of U.S. Amazon shoppers are Prime members and likely filter for Prime-eligible products. Using FBA begins in Seller Central. Merchants prep inventory to Amazon’s specifications and ship it to designated warehouses. Amazon distributes stock across its network and automatically routes orders. When customers make a purchase, Amazon employees pick, pack, and ship the order, which is often delivered within one to two days. Amazon also processes returns, with refunds issued directly to the customer. Amazon’s Multi-Channel Fulfillment allows retailers to use Amazon’s warehouses, staff, and shipping network to fulfill orders placed on external platforms such as eBay or their own websites. Walmart launched its FBA competitor, Walmart Fulfillment Services, in 2020 at the height of Covid. The timing was coincidental as the retail giant had planned the start, but the pandemic-induced ecommerce surge that followed might have helped get things rolling. Functionally, WFS operates similarly to FBA. Sellers apply through Walmart’s Seller Center. Once approved, those merchants send inventory to WFS warehouses. Walmart’s system routes orders automatically. There is even a “Fulfilled by Walmart” badge with a two-day delivery promise for Walmart Marketplace items. Two WFS differences stand out relative to FBA: returns and price. Orders placed on the Walmart Marketplace and fulfilled with WFS are returnable to nearly any of Walmart’s physical locations, offering a level of customer convenience. And WFS claims to be approximately 15% less expensive than FBA despite having a higher base rate, the apparent difference coming from additional fees for setup, storage, size, and similar. Walmart claims that WFS is about 15% cheaper than other marketplace fulfillment services. WFS is primarily for Walmart Marketplace sellers, but in September 2024, WFS began its own multichannel fulfillment service similar to Amazon’s MCF. Thus sellers can use WFS in combination with an internet store or other ecommerce channels. Essentially an app, Shopify Fulfillment Network makes it relatively easy for merchants to process Shopify orders through third-party fulfillment services. Sellers enable the SFN app in Shopify’s admin, connect catalogs, and send inventory to partner warehouses. Orders from Shopify and other connected channels flow into the system, which routes shipments to the closest node. Fulfillment partners store inventory and manage returns. Perhaps the key difference between SFN and FBA or WFS is control. A Shopify store owns its own brand and customer relationships. In contrast, FBA and WFS customers may have purchased directly from Amazon or Walmart, and they will most certainly recognize the brands’ packaging when the orders arrive. SFN has an eventful history. Shopify launched the service in 2019 with a $1 billion investment. In 2022, it acquired Deliverr for $2 billion, only to eventually sell it to Flexport, which became the default in-app service. Since the sale, Shopify sellers using SFN can work with several leading fulfillment providers, including ShipBob, Shipfusion, ShipMonk, DHL Fulfillment, and Amazon MCF. Merchants can utilize custom packaging with the SFN, manage multiple channels from a single dashboard, and display Shopify’s Shop Promise badge with two- to three-day deliveries. FBA, WFS, and SFN all offer comprehensive ecommerce fulfillment, and in at least a few ways are interchangeable. The services are not mutually exclusive. A single store can utilize FBA and WFS for its respective marketplace channels, while employing SFN for orders via Shopify and its TikTok shop. The takeaway? There are many excellent options for ecommerce order fulfillment. Share this article: Copyright © 2005 - 2025. Practical Ecommerce® is a registered trademark of Confluence Distribution, Inc.

Title: Why investors are on tenterhooks for Nvidia’s latest earnings report
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/27/why-investors-are-on-tenterhooks-for-nvidias-latest-earnings-report

The US chip giant is considered a bellwether for both the AI industry and Wall Street. By Erin Hale Chip giant Nvidia is set to release its latest earnings report – and the results could move the entire US stock market. Over the past two years, the chipmaker has risen to become the world’s most valuable company, with a market capitalisation of more than $4 trillion. When Nvidia announces its earnings on Wednesday, investors will get to see how the tech giant has been faring amid the tumult of President Donald Trump’s trade salvoes and concerns about whether artificial intelligence has been overhyped. Nvidia specialises in making the graphics processing units (GPUs) that power AI, including the Blackwell B200, marketed as the world’s most powerful chip. The California-based company’s chips have become essential to the world’s largest tech companies, including Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet, since AI exploded into the mainstream with the release of OpenAI’s generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, in November 2022. The company’s portfolio also includes data centres and gaming. Nvidia posted annual revenue of $130.5bn for the last fiscal year, which ended in late January. Analysts will be examining various metrics, including the company’s quarterly revenue. Nvidia’s revenue has been growing at breakneck speed for the past several years, thanks to the AI boom and the surge in demand for its chips. Nvidia posted triple-digit revenue growth for five straight quarters between mid-2023 and 2024, according to company filings. Since then, annual revenue growth has coasted in the high double digits. Last quarter, the company reported revenue of $44.1bn, a 69 percent increase from the same period a year ago. While such figures would be the envy of any company, the firm’s explosive performance has also raised questions about how long its stellar run can last. In advance of its forthcoming earnings report – which covers the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 – Nvidia has said it expects revenue of $45bn plus or minus 2 percent. Analysts have predicted revenue of up to $46bn, or 53 percent growth year-on-year. The earnings report is also expected to show signs of whiplash from the Trump administration’s tariff war. In April, Trump banned Nvidia from selling its H20 chip – specially designed for the Chinese market – to China. At the time, Nvidia said the ban would cost the company $8bn. Trump later walked back the ban when Nvidia agreed to share 15 percent of its H20 chip sales with the US government, a deal that was finalised on August 11, two weeks after the end of its second quarter. As Silicon Valley pours billions into AI, some observers, such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have questioned whether there is a bubble. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is, yes,” Altman told The Verge in an interview earlier this month. He is not the only one who is worried. Analysts have drawn parallels to the collapse of the “Nifty Fifty” in the 1970s, said Arun Sai, senior multi-asset strategist at Pictet Asset Management in the United Kingdom. The Nifty Fifty was a group of 50 of the most valuable companies in the US, including Xerox and IBM. Though highly profitable, the firms became highly overvalued in the late 1960s and early 70s. When the bubble burst following the 1973-74 stock market crash, the value of Nifty Fifty stocks fell by more than 50 percent. “They were fantastic companies, but they were trading on the wrong price,” Sai told Al Jazeera. “This is the old notion of you could be a great company, but not a great stock if the price is wrong.” Five decades later, some investors are asking whether the “Magnificent Seven” – Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla – could be overvalued as well. Valuations have soared into the trillions of dollars on the back of the AI boom, although there is some divergence within the group, with Apple and Tesla faring less well recently. Amazon recently said it expects to spend $85bn on AI over the next year, while Microsoft predicts it will spend $100bn. AI has been one of the few bright spots in an otherwise slowing economy that has been undergoing upheaval since Trump took office. “Growth is dwindling in other sectors, but there is this very small, niche, concentrated pocket of hyper growth,” Sai said. “This suddenly becomes a much bigger contributor to US GDP growth than it would have been in a normal phase of the cycle.” Corporate spending on AI has been likened to an arms race, but tech giants – and Nvidia customers – will also sooner or later need to show investors that their betting on the sector will lead to profits. US tech giants are already facing challenges from companies like China’s DeepSeek, which made global headlines in January when it unveiled a powerful but much cheaper AI model. So far, innovation does not appear to be translating into higher returns. In a recent survey by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), 95 percent of enterprises looked at reported no return on their AI investments despite the billions ploughed into the sector. Because of its sky-high valuation, Nvidia alone makes up almost 8 percent of the S&P500 – the benchmark index of 500 top companies listed on the US stock market. That means Nvidia’s earnings have the potential to have a significant impact, good or bad, on the stock market as a whole. Big movements in Nvidia’s stock price have triggered swings in the S&P 500 of 1 percent or more in the past. After Nvidia’s earnings results in February sent its share price down more than 8 percent, the S&P 500 fell 1.6 percent. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Chipmaker Nvidia is poised to release a quarterly report that could provide a better sense of whether the stock market has been riding an overhyped artificial intelligence bubble or is being propelled by a technological boom that’s still gathering mome... SAN FRANCISCO -- Chipmaker Nvidia will release a quarterly report Wednesday that could provide a better sense of whether the stock market has been riding an overhyped artificial intelligence bubble or is being propelled by a technological boom that's still gathering momentum. Nvidia become the first publicly traded company to surpass a market value of $4 trillion last month, and its stock price has gained another 13% since then to create an additional $500 billion in shareholder wealth. The latest financial results are due out Wednesday afternoon. They have become a key AI barometer during the past two years because Nvidia makes most of the chips that power the technology in vast data centers at the center of the boom. This summer's run-up has continued Nvidia's jaw-dropping rise from early 2023, when the company's market value was hovering around $400 billion. That was shortly after OpenAI's late 2022 release of its ChatGPT chatbot triggered the biggest craze in technology since Apple released the first iPhone in 2007. While the technology industry has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI frenzy, it's also been a boon for the overall stock market. The benchmark S&P 500 has gained 68% since the end of 2022, with AI fervor fueling much of the investor optimism. But even amid the general euphoria, there recently have been murmurs about whether AI mania will prove to be an echo of the late 1990s dot-com boom that culminated in an excruciating stock market meltdown in 2000 that eventually drove the U.S. economy and plunged Silicon Valley into a funk that lasted several years before the tech industry began to thrive again. Investors were recently spooked by a combination of an MIT report that said 95% of AI pilots fail and comments from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman floating the idea that the artificial intelligence market is in a bubble. And by some metrics, the stock prices of tech companies at the AI are looking frothy. For instance, Nvidia is trading at about 40 times its future earnings, roughly double the rate that investors traditionally believe is a reasonable level. Meanwhile, the market value of Microsoft, another AI leader, is hovering just below $4 trillion, while the values of other fellow pacesetters Amazon, Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Google parent Alphabet currently range from $1.9 trillion to $2.5 trillion. Nvidia is expected to post another quarter of robust growth for the May-July period of its fiscal year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet research predict Nvidia will earn $1.01 per share, excluding certain items unrelated to its ongoing business, which would be a 49% increase from the same time last year. The analysts anticipated Nvidia's revenue would rise 53% from a year ago to about $46 billion. Those gains reflect the financial tsunami flooding the AI market as the biggest players spend heavily to build and expand data centers needed to power the technology. Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta are collectively budgeting more than $325 billion for investments in AI this year. With its dominant position in the AI chip market, Nvidia is reaping the benefits of that intense demand. Even so, the trajectory of Nvidia's growth has been tapering off. If analyst projections pan out, Nvidia's revenue growth for its latest quarter will be significantly lower than the 122% increase it posted during the same period last year. And Nvidia has also been losing business because of President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Following a ban on its AI chip sales in China, which resulted in a $4.5 billion blow to its finances during its fiscal first quarter, Nvidia estimated that the restrictions would cost it about approximately $8 billion in sales in this during the past quarter. Trump took the China handcuffs off of Nvidia earlier this month in return for a 15% cut of the company's sales in that country — a compromise CEO Jensen Huang is expected to discuss with analysts while he shares his perspective on the state of the AI market on a call with investors. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Editor's Note: For those of you reading via email, I recommend opening this in a browser so you can use the Table of Contents. This is my longest newsletter - a 16,000-word-long opus - and if you like it, please subscribe to my premium newsletter. Thanks for reading! In the last two years I've written no less than 500,000 words, with many of them dedicated to breaking both existent and previous myths about the state of technology and the tech industry itself. While I feel no resentment — I really enjoy writing, and feel privileged to be able to write about this and make money doing so — I do feel that there is a massive double standard between those perceived as "skeptics" and "optimists." To be skeptical of AI is to commit yourself to near-constant demands to prove yourself, and endless nags of "but what about?" with each one — no matter how small — presented as a fact that defeats any points you may have. Conversely, being an "optimist" allows you to take things like AI 2027 — which I will fucking get to — seriously to the point that you can write an entire feature about fan fiction in the New York Times and nobody will bat an eyelid. In any case, things are beginning to fall apart. Two of the actual reporters at the New York Times (rather than a "columnist") reported out last week that Meta is yet again "restructuring" its AI department for the fourth time, and that it’s considering "downsizing the A.I. division overall," which sure doesn't seem like something you'd do if you thought AI was the future. Meanwhile, the markets are also thoroughly spooked by an MIT study covered by Fortune that found that 95% of generative AI pilots at companies are failing, and though MIT NANDA has now replaced the link to the study with a Google Form to request access, you can find the full PDF here, in the kind of move that screams "PR firm wants to try and set up interviews." Not for me, thanks! In any case, the report is actually grimmer than Fortune made it sound, saying that "95% of organizations are getting zero return [on generative AI]." The report says that "adoption is high, but transformation is low," adding that "...few industries show the deep structural shifts associated with past general-purpose technologies such as new market leaders, disrupted business models, or measurable changes in customer behavior." Yet the most damning part was the "Five Myths About GenAI in the Enterprise," which is probably the most wilting takedown of this movement I've ever seen: These are brutal, dispassionate points that directly deal with the most common boosterisms. Generative AI isn't transforming anything, AI isn't replacing anyone, enterprises are trying to adopt generative AI but it doesn't fucking work, and the thing holding back AI is the fact it doesn't fucking work. This isn't a case where "the enterprise" is suddenly going to save these companies, because the enterprise already tried, and it isn't working. An incorrect read of the study has been that the "learning gap" that makes these things less useful, when the study actually says that "...the fundamental gap that defines the GenAI divide [is that users resist tools that don't adapt, model quality fails without context, and UX suffers when systems can't remember." This isn't something you learn your way out of. The products don't do what they're meant to do, and people are realizing it. Nevertheless, boosters will still find a way to twist this study to mean something else. They'll claim that AI is still early, that the opportunity is still there, that we "didn't confirm that the internet or smartphones were productivity boosting," or that we're in "the early days" of AI, somehow, three years and hundreds of billions and thousands of articles in. I'm tired of having the same arguments with these people, and I'm sure you are too. No matter how much blindly obvious evidence there is to the contrary they will find ways to ignore it. They continually make smug comments about people "wishing things would be bad" or suggesting you are stupid — and yes, that is their belief! — for not believing generative AI is disruptive. Today, I’m going to give you the tools to fight back against the AI boosters in your life. I’m going to go into the generalities of the booster movement — the way they argue, the tropes they cling to, and the ways in which they use your own self-doubt against you. They’re your buddy, your boss, a man in a gingham shirt at Epic Steakhouse who won't leave you the fuck alone, a Redditor, a writer, a founder or a simple con artist — whoever the booster in your life is, I want you to have the words to fight them with. So, this is my longest newsletter ever, and I built it for quick reference - and, for the first time, gave you a Table of Contents. So, an AI booster is not, in many cases, an actual fan of artificial intelligence. People like Simon Willison or Max Woolf who actually work with LLMs on a daily basis don’t see the need to repeatedly harass everybody, or talk down to them about their unwillingness to pledge allegiance to the graveyard smash of generative AI. In fact, the closer I’ve found somebody to actually building things with LLMs, the less likely they are to emphatically argue that I’m missing out by not doing so myself. No, the AI booster is symbolically aligned with generative AI. They are fans in the same way that somebody is a fan of a sports team, their houses emblazoned with every possible piece of tat they can find, their Sundays living and dying by the success of the team, except even fans of the Dallas Cowboys have a tighter grasp on reality. Kevin Roose and Casey Newton are two of the most notable boosters, and — as I’ll get into later in this piece — neither of them have a consistent or comprehensive knowledge of AI. Nevertheless, they will insist that “everybody is using AI for everything” — a statement that even a booster should realize is incorrect based on the actual abilities of the models. But that’s because it isn’t about what’s actually happening, it’s about allegiance. AI symbolizes something to the AI booster — a way that they’re better than other people, that makes them superior because they (unlike “cynics” and “skeptics”) are able to see the incredible potential in the future of AI, but also how great it is today, though they never seem to be able to explain why outside of “it replaced search for me!” and “I use it to draw connections between articles I write,” which is something I do without AI using my fucking brain. Boosterism is a kind of religion, interested in finding symbolic “proof” that things are getting “better” in some indeterminate way, and that anyone that chooses to believe otherwise is ignorant. I’ll give you an example. Thomas Ptacek’s “My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts” was catnip for boosters — a software engineer using technical terms like “interact with Git” and “MCP,” vague charts, and, of course, an extremely vague statement that says hallucinations aren’t a problem: Is it? Anyway, my favourite part of the blog is this: Nobody projects more than an AI booster. They thrive on the sense they’re oppressed and villainized after years of seemingly every outlet claiming they’re right regardless of whether there’s any proof. They sneer and jeer and cry constantly that people are not showing adequate amounts of awe when an AI lab says “we did something in private, we can’t share it with you, but it’s so cool,” and constantly act as if they’re victims as they spread outright misinformation, either through getting things wrong or never really caring enough to check. Also, none of the booster arguments actually survive a thorough response, as Nik Suresh proved with his hilarious and brutal takedown of Ptacek’s piece. There are, I believe, some people who truly do love using LLMs, yet they are not the ones defending them. Ptacek’s piece drips with condescension, to the point that it feels like he’s trying to convince himself how good LLMs are, and because boosters are eternal victims, he wrote them a piece that they could send around to skeptics and say “heh, see?” without being able to explain why it was such a brutal takedown, mostly because they can’t express why other than “well this guy gets it!” One cannot be the big, smart genius that understands the glory and power of AI while also acting like a scared little puppy every time somebody tells them it sucks. In fact, that’s a great place to start. When you speak to an AI booster, you may get the instinct to shake them vigorously, or respond to their post by saying to do something with your something, or that they’re “stupid.” I understand the temptation, but you want to keep a head on a swivel — they thrive on victimisation. I’m sorry if you are an AI booster and this makes you feel bad. Please reflect on your work and how many times you’ve referred to somebody who didn’t understand AI in a manner that suggested they were ignorant, or tried to gaslight them by saying “AI was powerful” while providing no actionable ways in which it is. You cannot — and should not! — allow these people to act as if they are being victimized or “othered.” First and foremost: there are boosters at pretty much every major think tank, government agency and media outlet. It’s extremely lucrative being a booster. You’re showered with panel invites, access to executives, and are able to get headlines by saying how scared you are of the computer with ease. Being a booster is the easy path! Being a critic requires you to constantly have to explain yourself in a way that boosters never have to. If a booster says this to you, ask them to explain: There is no answer here, because this is not a coherent point of view. Boosters are more successful, get more perks and are in general better-treated than any critic. Fundamentally, these people exist in the land of the vague. They will drag you toward what's just on the horizon, but never quite define what the thing that dazzles you will be, or when it will arrive. Really, their argument comes down to one thought: you must get on board now, because at some point it'll be so good you'll feel stupid for not believing something that kind of sucks wouldn't be really good. If this line sounds familiar, it’s because you’ve heard it a million times before, most notably with crypto. They will make you define what would impress you, which isn't your job, in the same way finding a use case for them isn't your job. In fact, you are the customer! Here’s a great place to start: say “that’s a really weird thing to say!” It is peculiar to suggest that somebody doesn’t get how to use a product, and that we, as the customer, must justify ourselves to our own purchases. Make them justify their attitude. Just like any product, we buy software to serve a need. This is meant to be artificial *intelligence* — why is it so fucking stupid that I have to work out why it's useful? The answer, of course, is that it has no intellect, is not intelligent, and Large Language Models are being pushed up a mountain by a cadre of people who are either easily impressed or invested — either emotionally or financially — in its success due to the company they keep or their intentions for the world. If a booster suggests you “just don’t get it,” ask them to explain: Their use cases will likely be that AI has replaced search for them, that they use it for brainstorming or journaling, proof-reading an article, or looking through a big pile of their notes (or some other corpus of information) and summarizing it or pulling out insights. If a booster refers to AI “being powerful” and getting “more powerful,” ask them: The core of the AI booster’s argument is to make you feel bad. They will suggest you are intentionally not liking A.I. because you're a hater, or a cynic, or a Luddite. They will suggest that you are ignorant for not being amazed by ChatGPT. To be clear, anyone with a compelling argument doesn’t have to make you feel bad to convince you. The iPhone - and to be clear, I am referring to the concept of the smartphone and its utility, I am aware that there was marketing for the iPhone - didn’t need a fucking marketing campaign to explain why one device that can do a bunch of things you already find useful was good. You don't have to be impressed by ANYTHING by default, and any product — especially software — designed to make you feel stupid for "not getting it" is poorly designed. ChatGPT is the ultimate form of Silicon Valley Sociopathy — you must do the work to find the use cases, and thank them for being given the chance to do so. A.I. is not even good, reliable software! It resembles the death of the art of technology — inconsistent and unreliable by definition, inefficient by design, financially ruinous, and ADDS to the cognitive load of the user by requiring them to be ever-vigilant. So, here’s a really easy way to deal with this: if a booster ever suggests you are stupid or ignorant, ask them why it’s necessary to demean you to get their point across! Even if you are unable to argue on a technical level, make them explain why the software itself can’t convince you. Boosters will do everything they can to pull you off course. If you say that none of these companies make money, they’ll say it’s the early days. If you say AI companies burn billions, they’ll say the cost of inference is coming down. If you say the industry is massively overbuilding, they’ll say that this is actually just like the dot com boom and that the infrastructure will be picked up and used in the future. If you say there are no real use cases, they’ll say that ChatGPT has 700 million weekly users. Every time there’s the same god damn arguments, so I’ve sat down and written as many of them as I can think of. Print this and feed it to your local booster today. Anytime a booster says “AI will,” tell them to stop and explain what AI can do, and if they insist, ask them both when to expect the things they’re talking about, and if they say “very soon,” ask them to be more specific. Get them to agree to a date, then call them on that date. There’s that “will” bullshit again. Agents don’t work! They don’t work at all. The term “agent” means, to quote Max Woolf, “a workflow where the LLM can make its own decisions, [such as in the case of] web search [where] the LLM is told “you can search the web if you need to” then can output “I should search the web” and do so.” Yet “agent” has now become a mythical creature that means “totally autonomous AI that can do an entire job.” if anyone tells you “agents are…” you should ask them to point to one. If they say “coding,” please demand that they explain how autonomous these things are, and if they say that they can “refactor entire codebases,” ask them what that means, and also laugh at them. Here’s a comprehensive rundown, but here’s a particularly important part: Long story short, agents are not autonomous, they do not replace jobs, they cannot “replace coders,” they are not going to do so because probabilistic models are a horrible means of taking precise actions, and almost anyone who brings up agents as a booster is either misinformed or in the business of misinformation. Let's start with a really simple question: what does this actually mean? In many cases, I think they're referring to AI as being "like the early days of the internet." "The early days of the internet" can refer to just about anything. Are we talking about dial-up? DSL? Are we talking about the pre-platform days when people accessed it via Compuserve or AOL? Yes, yes, I remember that article from Newsweek, I already explained it here: In any case, one guy saying that the internet won't be big doesn't mean a fucking thing about generative AI and you are a simpleton if you think it does. One guy being wrong in some way is not a response to my work. I will crush you like a bug. If your argument is that the early internet required expensive Sun Microsystems servers to run, Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs addressed that by saying that the costs "pale in comparison," adding that we also didn't need to expand our power grid to build the early Web. This is a straight-up lie. Sorry! Also, as Jim Covello noted, there were hundreds of presentations in the early 2000s that included roadmaps that accurately fit how smartphones rolled out, and that no such roadmap exists for generative AI. The iPhone was also an immediate success as a thing that people paid for, with Apple selling four million units in the space of six months. Hell, in 2006 (the year before the iPhone launch), there was an estimated 17.7 million worldwide smartphone shipments (mostly from BlackBerry and other companies building on Windows Mobile, with Palm vacuuming up the crumbs), though to be generous to the generative AI boosters, I’ll disregard those. The original Attention Is All You Need paper — the one that kicked off the transformer-based Large Language Model era — was published in June 2017. ChatGPT launched in November 2022. Nevertheless, if we're saying "early days" here, we should actually define what that means. As I mentioned above, people paid for the iPhone immediately, despite it being a device that was completely and utterly new. While there was a small group of consumers that might have used similar devices (like the iPAQ), this was a completely new kind of computing, sold at a premium, requiring you to have a contract with a specific carrier (Cingular, now known as AT&T). Conversely, ChatGPT's "annualized" revenue in December 2023 was $1.6 billion (or $133 million a month), for a product that had, by that time, raised over $10 billion, and while we don't know what OpenAI lost in 2023, reports suggest it burned over $5 billion in 2024. Big tech has spent over $500 billion in capital expenditures in the last 18 months, and all told — between investments of cloud credits and infrastructure — will likely sink over $600 billion by year's-end. The "early days" of the internet were defined not by its lack of investment or attention, but by its obscurity. Even in 2000 — around the time of the dot-com bubble — only 52% of US adults used the internet, and it would take another 19 years for 90% of US adults to do so. These early days were also defined by its early functionality. The internet would become so much more because of the things that hyper-connectivity allowed us to do, and both faster internet connections and the ability to host software in the cloud would change, well, everything. We could define what “better” would mean, and make reasonable predictions about what people could do on a “better” internet. Yet even in those early days, it was obvious why you were using the internet, and how it might grow from there. One did not have to struggle to explain why buying a book online might be useful, or why a website might be a quicker reference than having to go to a library, or why downloading a game or a song might be a good idea. While habits might have needed adjusting, it was blatantly obvious what the value of the early internet was. It's also unclear when the early days of the internet ended. Only 44% of US adults had access to broadband internet by 2006. Were those the early days of the internet? The answer is "no," and that this point is brought up by people with a poor grasp of history and a flimsy attachment to reality. The early days of the internet were very, very different to any associated tech boom since, and we need to stop making the comparison. The internet also grew in a vastly different information ecosystem. Generative AI has had the benefit of mass media — driven by the internet! — along with social media (and social pressure) to "adopt AI" for multiple years. According to Pew, as of mid-June 2025, 34% of US adults have used ChatGPT, with 79% saying they had "heard at least a little about it." Furthermore, ChatGPT has always had a free version. On top of that, a study from May 2023 found that over 10,900 news headlines mentioned ChatGPT between November, 2022 and March, 2023, and a BrandWatch report found that in the first five months of its release, ChatGPT received over 9.24 million mentions on social media. Nearly 80% of people have heard of ChatGPT, and over a quarter of Americans have used it. If we're defining "the early days" based on consumer exposure, that ship has sailed. If we're defining "the early days" by the passage of time, it's been 8 years since Attention Is All You Need, and three since ChatGPT came out. While three years might not seem like a lot of time, the whole foundation of an "early days" argument is that in the early days, things do not receive the venture funding, research, attention, infrastructural support or business interest necessary to make them "big." In 2024, nearly 33% of all global venture funding went to artificial intelligence, and according to The Information, AI startups have raised over $40 billion in 2025 alone, with Statista adding that AI absorbed 71% of VC funding in Q1 2025. These numbers also fail to account for the massive infrastructure that companies like OpenAI and Anthropic don't have to pay for. The limitations of the early internet were two-fold: In generative AI's case, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have built out the "fiber optic cables" for Large Language Models. OpenAI and Anthropic have everything they need. They have (even if they say otherwise) plenty of compute, access to the literal greatest minds in the field, the constant attention of the media and global governments, and effectively no regulations or restrictions stopping them from training their models on the works of millions of people, or destroying our environment. They have already had this support. OpenAI was allowed to burn half a billion dollars on a training run for GPT-4.5 and 5. If anything, the massive amounts of capital have allowed us to massively condense the time in which a bubble goes from "possible" to "bursting and washing out a bunch of people," because the tech industry has such a powerful follower culture that only one or two unique ideas can exist at one time. The "early days" argument hinges on obscurity and limited resources, something that generative AI does not get to whine about. Companies that make effectively no revenue can raise $500 million to do the same AI coding bullshit that everybody else does. In simpler terms, these companies are flush with cash, have all the attention and investment they could possibly need, and are still unable to create a product with a defined, meaningful, mass-market use case. In fact, I believe that thanks to effectively infinite resources, we've speed-run the entire Large Language Model era, and we're nearing the end. These companies got what they wanted. Bonus trick: ask them to tell you what “the fiber boom” was. So, a little history. The "fiber boom" began after the telecommunications act of 1996 deregulated large parts of America's communications infrastructure, creating a massive boom — a $500 billion one to be precise, primarily funded with debt: In one sense, explaining what happened to the telecom sector is very simple: the growth in capacity has vastly outstripped the growth in demand. In the five years since the 1996 bill became law, telecommunications companies poured more than $500 billion into laying fiber optic cable, adding new switches, and building wireless networks. So much long-distance capacity was added in North America, for example, that no more than two percent is currently being used. With the fixed costs of these new networks so high and the marginal costs of sending signals over them so low, it is not a surprise that competition has forced prices down to the point where many firms have lost the ability to service their debts. No wonder we have seen so many bankruptcies and layoffs. This piece, written in 2002, is often cited as a defense against the horrifying capex associated with generative AI, as that fiber optic cable has been useful for delivering high-speed internet. Useful, right? This period was also defined by a gluttony of over-investment, ridiculous valuations and outright fraud. In any case, this is not remotely the same thing and anyone making this point needs to learn the very fucking basics of technology. GPUs are built to shove massive amounts of compute into one specific function again and again, like generating the output of a model (which, remember, mostly boils down to complex maths). Unlike CPUs, a GPU can't easily change tasks, or handle many little distinct operations, meaning that these things aren't going to be adopted for another mass-scale use case. In simpler terms, this was not an infrastructure buildout. The GPU boom is a heavily-centralized, capital expenditure-funded asset bubble where a bunch of chips will sit in warehouses waiting for somebody to make up a use case for them, and if an endearing one existed, we'd already have it because we already have all the fucking GPUs. You are describing fan fiction. AI 2027 is fan fiction. Anyone who believes in it is a mark! It doesn’t matter if all of the people writing the fan fiction are scientists, or that they all have “the right credentials.” They themselves say that AI 2027 is a “guess,” an “extrapolation” (guess) with “expert feedback” (someone editing your fan fiction), and involves “experience at OpenAI” (there are people that worked on the shows they write fan fiction about). I am not going to go line-by-line to cut this apart anymore than I am going to write a lengthy takedown of someone’s erotic Banjo Kazooie story, because both are fictional. The entire premise of this nonsense is that at one point someone invents a self-learning “agent” that teaches itself stuff, and it does a bunch of other stuff as a result, with different agents with different numbers after them. There is no proof this is possible, nobody has done it, nobody will do it. AI 2027 was written specifically to fool people that wanted to be fooled, with big charts and the right technical terms used to lull the credulous into a wet dream and New York Times column where one of the writers folds their hands and looks worried. It was also written to scare people that are already scared. It makes big, scary proclamations, with tons of links to stuff that looks really legitimate but, when you piece it all together, is still fan fiction. My personal favourite part is “Mid 2026: China Wakes Up,” which involves China’s intelligence agencies trying to steal OpenBrain’s agent (no idea who this company could be referring to, I’m stumped!), before the headline of “AI Takes Some Jobs” after OpenBrain released a model oh god I am so bored even writing up this tripe! Sarah Lyons put it well, arguing that AI 2027 (and AI in general) is no different from the spurious “spectral evidence” used to accuse someone of being a witch during the Salem Witch Trials: Anyway, AI 2027 is fan fiction, nothing more, and just because it’s full of fancy words and has five different grifters on its byline doesn’t mean anything. Bonus trick: Ask them to explain whether things have actually got cheaper, and if they say they have, ask them why there are no profitable AI companies. If they say “they’re currently in growth stage,” ask them why there are no profitable AI companies. At this point they should try and kill you. In an interview on a podcast from earlier in the year, journalist Casey Newton said the following about my work: Newton then says — several octaves higher, showing how mad he isn't — that "[he] thought what [he] said was very civil" and that there are "things that are true and there are things that are false, like you can choose which ones you wanna believe." I am not going to be so civil. Other than the fact that Casey refers to "micro-innovations" (?) and "DeepSeek being on a curve that was expected," he makes — as many do — two very big mistakes, ones that I personally would not have said in a sentence that begun with suggesting that I knew how the technology works. Inference — and I've gotten this one wrong in the past too! — is everything that happens from when you put a prompt in to generate an output. It's when an AI, based on your prompt, "infers" meaning. To be more specific, and quoting Google, "...machine learning inference is the process of running data points into a machine learning model to calculate an output such as a single numerical score." Casey will try and weasel out of this one and say this is what he meant. It wasn't. Casey, like many people who talk about stuff without learning about it first, is likely referring to the fact that the price of tokens for some models has gone down in some cases. The problem, however, is that these are raw token costs, not actual expressions or evaluations of token burn in a practical setting. Worse still… Well, the cost of inference actually went up. In an excellent blog for Kilocode, Ewa Szyszka explained: Token consumption per application grew a lot because models allowed for longer context windows and bigger suggestions from the models. The combination of a steady price per token and more token consumption caused app inference costs to grow about 10x over the last two years. To explain in really simple terms, while the costs of old models may have decreased, new models cost about the same, and the "reasoning" that these models do actually burn way, way more tokens. When these new models "reason," they break a user's input and break into component parts, then run inference on each one of those parts. When you plug an LLM into an AI coding environment, it will naturally burn an absolute ton of tokens, in part because of the large amount of information you have to load into the prompt (and the "context window," or the information you load in with your prompt, with token burn increasing with the size of that information), and in part because generating code is inference-intensive. In fact, the inference costs are so severe that Szyszka says that "...combination of a steady price per token and more token consumption caused app inference costs to grow about 10x over the last two years." I refuse to let this point go, because people love to say "the cost of inference is going down" when the cost of inference has increased, and they do so to a national audience, all while suggesting I am wrong somehow. I am not wrong. In fact, software development influencer Theo Browne recently put out a video called "I was wrong about AI costs (they keep going up)," which he breaks down as follows: The price drops have, for the most part, stopped. See the below chart from The Information: You cannot, at this point, fairly evaluate whether a model is "cheaper" just based on its cost-per-tokens, because reasoning models are inherently built to use more tokens to create an output. Reasoning models are also the only way that model developers have been able to improve the efficacy of new models, using something called "test-time compute" to burn extra tokens to complete a task. And in basically anything you're using today, there's gonna be some sort of reasoning model, especially if you're coding. The cost of inference has gone up. Statements otherwise are purely false, and are the opinion of somebody who does not know what he's talking about. ...maybe? It sure isn't trending that way, nor has it gone down yet. I also predict that there's going to be a sudden realization in the media that it's going up, which has kind of already started. The Information had a piece recently about it, where they note that Intuit paid $20 million to Azure last year (primarily for access to OpenAI's models), and is on track to spend $30 million this year, which "outpaces the company's revenue growth in the same period, raising questions about how sustainable the spending is and how much of the cost it can pass along to customers." The problem here is that the architecture underlying Large Language Models is inherently unreliable. I imagine OpenAI's introduction of the router to ChatGPT-5 is an attempt to moderate both the costs of the model chosen and reduce the amount of exposure to reasoning models for simple queries — though Altman was boasting on August 10th about the "significant increase" in both free and paid users' exposure to reasoning models. Worse still, a study written up by VentureBeat found that open-weight models burn between 1.5 to 4 times more tokens, in part due to a lack of token efficiency, and in particular thanks to — you guessed it! — reasoning models: The findings challenge a prevailing assumption in the AI industry that open-source models offer clear economic advantages over proprietary alternatives. While open-source models typically cost less per token to run, the study suggests this advantage can be “easily offset if they require more tokens to reason about a given problem.” And models keep getting bigger and more expensive, too. Because model developers hit a wall of diminishing returns, and the only way to make their models do more was to make them burn more tokens to generate a more accurate response (this is a very simple way of describing reasoning, a thing that OpenAI launched in September 2024 and others followed). As a result, all the "gains" from "powerful new models" come from burning more and more tokens. The cost-per-million-token number is no longer an accurate measure of the actual costs of generative AI, because it's much, much harder to tell how many tokens a reasoning model may burn, and it varies (as Theo Browne noted) from model to model. In any case, there really is no changing this path. They are out of ideas. So, I've heard this argument maybe 50 times in the last year, to the point that I had to talk about it in my July 2024 piece "How Does OpenAI Survive." Nevertheless, people make a few points about Uber and AI that I think are fundamentally incorrect, and I'll break them down for you. I've seen this argument a lot, and it's one that's both ahistorical and alarmingly ignorant of the very basics of society. So, OpenAI got a $200 million defense contract with an "estimated completion date of July 2026," and is selling ChatGPT Enterprise to the US government for a dollar a year (along with Anthropic, which sells access to Claude for the same price, Even Google is undercutting them, selling Gemini access at 47 cents for a year). You're probably reading that and saying "oh no, that means the government has paid them now, they're never going away," and I cannot be clear enough that you believing this is the intention of these deals. These are built specifically to make you feel like these things are never going away. This is also an attempt to get "in" with the government at a rate that makes "trying" these models a no-brainer. ...and??????? "The government is going to have cheap access to AI software" does not mean that "the government relies on AI software." Every member of the government having access to ChatGPT — something that is not even necessarily the case! — does not make this software useful, let alone essential, and if OpenAI burns a bunch of money "making it work for them," it still won't be essential, because Large Language Models are not actually that useful for doing stuff! Uber used lobbyist Bradley Tusk to steamroll local governments into allowing Uber to operate in their cities, but Tusk did not have to convince local governments that Uber was useful or have to train people how to use it. Uber's "too big to fail" moment was that local cabs kind of fucking sucked just about everywhere. Did you ever try and take a yellow cab from Downtown Manhattan to Hoboken New Jersey? Or Brooklyn? Or Queens? Did you ever try to pay with a credit card? How about trying to get a cab outside of a major metropolitan area? Do you remember how bad that was? I am not glorifying Uber the company, but the experience that Uber replaced was very, very bad. As a result, Uber did become too big to fail, because people now rely upon it because the old system sucked. Uber used its masses of venture capital to keep prices low to get people used to it too, but the fundamental experience was better than calling a cab company and hoping that they showed up. I also want to be clear this is not me condoning Uber, take public transport if you can! To be clear, Uber has created a new kind of horrifying, extractive labor practice which deprives people of benefits and dignity, paying off academics to help the media gloss over the horrors of its platform. It is also now having to increase prices. What, exactly, is the "essential" experience of generative AI? What essential experience are we going to miss if ChatGPT disappears tomorrow? And on an enterprise or governmental level: what exactly are these tools doing for governments that would make removing them so painful? What use cases? What outcomes? Uber's "essential" nature is that millions of people use it in place of regular taxis, and it effectively replaced decrepit, exploitative systems like the yellow cab medallions in New York with its own tech-enabled exploitation system that, nevertheless, worked far better for the user. Sidenote: although I acknowledge that the disruption that Uber brought to the medallion system had horrendous consequences for the owners of said medallions — some of whom had paid more than a million dollars for the privilege to drive a New York taxi cab, and were burdened under mountains of debt. There is no such use case with ChatGPT, or any other generative AI system. You cannot point to one use case that is anywhere near as necessary as cabs in cities, and indeed the biggest use cases — things like brainstorming and search — are either easily replaced by any other commoditized LLM or literally already exist with Google Search. Nope! Sorry, this is a really simple one. These data centers are not, in and of themselves, driving much economic growth other than in the costs of building them. As I've discussed again and again, there's maybe $40 billion in revenue and no profit coming out of these companies. There isn't any economic growth! They're not holding up anything! These data centers, once built, also create very little economic activity. They don't create jobs, they take up massive amounts of land and utilities, and they piss off and poison their neighbors. If anything, letting these things die would be a political win. There is no "great loss" associated with the death of the Large Language Model era. Taking away Uber would genuinely affect people's ability to get places. So, the classic (and wrong!) argument about OpenAI and companies like OpenAI is that "Uber burned a bunch of money and is now "cash-flow positive" or "profitable." Let's talk about raw losses, and where people are making this assumption. Uber lost $24.9 billion in the space of four years (2019 to 2022), in part because of the billions it was spending on sales and marketing and R&D — $4.6 billion and $4.8 billion respectively in 2019 alone. It also massively subsidized the cost of rides — which is why prices had to increase — and spent heavily on driver recruitment, burning cash to get scale, the classic Silicon Valley way. This is absolutely nothing like how Large Language Models are growing, and I am tired of defending this point. OpenAI and Anthropic burn money primarily through compute costs and specialized talent. These costs are increasing, especially with the rush to hire every single AI scientist at the most expensive price possible. There are also essential, immovable costs that neither OpenAI nor Anthropic have to shoulder — the construction of the data centers necessary to train and run inference for their models, which I will get to in a little bit. Yes, Uber raised $33.5 billion (through multiple rounds of post-IPO debt, though it raised about $25 billion in actual funding). Yes, Uber burned an absolute ass-ton of money. Yes, Uber has scale. But Uber was not burning money as a means of making its product functional or useful. Furthermore, the costs associated with Uber — and its capital expenditures from 2019 through 2024 were around $2.2 billion! — are miniscule compared to the actual costs of OpenAI and Anthropic. Both OpenAI and Anthropic lost around $5 billion in 2024, but their infrastructure was entirely paid for by either Microsoft, Google or Amazon. While we don't know how much of this infrastructure is specifically for OpenAI or Anthropic, as the largest model developers it's fair to assume that a large chunk — at least 30% — of Amazon and Microsoft's capital expenditures have been to support these loads (I leave out Google as it's unclear whether it’s expanded its infrastructure for Anthropic, but we know Amazon has done so). As a result, the true "cost" of OpenAI and Anthropic is at least ten times what Uber burned. Amazon spent $83 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and expects to spend $105 billion in 2025. Microsoft spent $55.6 billion in 2024 and expects to spend $80 billion this year. Based on my (conservative) calculations, the true "cost" of OpenAI is around $82 billion, and that only includes capex from 2024 onward, based on 30% of Microsoft's capex (as not everything has been invested yet in 2025, and OpenAI is not necessarily all of the capex) and the $41.4 billion of funding it’s received so far. The true cost of Anthropic is around $77.1 billion, including all its funding and 30% of Amazon's capex from the beginning of 2024. These are inexact comparisons, but the classic argument is that Uber "burned lots of money and worked out okay," when in fact the combined capital expenditures from 2024 onwards that are necessary to make Anthropic and OpenAI work are each — on their own — four times the amount Uber burned in over a decade. I also believe that these numbers are conservative. There's a good chance that Anthropic and OpenAI dominate the capex of Amazon and Microsoft, in part because what the fuck else are they buying all these GPUs for, as their own AI services don't seem to be making that much money at all. Anyway, to put it real simple, AI has burned more in the last two years than Uber burned in ten, Uber didn't burn money in the same way, didn't burn much by way of capital expenditures, didn't require massive amounts of infrastructure, and isn't remotely the same in any way, shape or form, other than it burned a lot of money — and that burning wasn’t because it was trying to build the core product, but rather trying to scale. I covered this in depth in the Hater's Guide To The AI Bubble, but the long and short of it is that AWS is a platform, a necessity with an obvious choice, and has burned about ten percent of what Amazon et. al has burned chasing generative AI, and had proven demand before building it. Also, AWS was break-even in three years. OpenAI was founded in fucking 2015, and even if you start from November 2022, by AWS standards it should be break-even! Amazon Web Services was created out of necessity — Amazon's infrastructure needs were so great that it effectively had to build both the software and hardware necessary to deliver a store that sold theoretically everything to theoretically anywhere, handling both the traffic from customers, delivering the software that runs Amazon.com quickly and reliably, and, well, making sure things ran in a stable way. It didn't need to come up with a reason for people to run web applications — they were already doing so themselves, but in ways that cost a lot, were inflexible, and required specialist skills. AWS took something that people already did, and what there was a proven demand for, and made it better. Eventually, Google and Microsoft would join the fray. As I’ve discussed in the past, this metric is basically “monthx12,” and while it’s a fine measure for high-gross-margin businesses like SaaS companies, it isn’t for AI. It doesn’t account for churn (when people leave). It also is a number intentionally used to make a company sound more successful — so you can say “$200 million annualized revenue” instead of “$16.6 million a month.” Also, if they’re saying this number, it’s likely that number isn’t consistent! Also: Simple answer: why have literally none of them done this yet? Why not one? Why? There’s that “will” bullshit, once again, always about the “will.” We do not know how thinking works in humans and thus cannot extrapolate it to a machine, and at the very least human beings have the ability to re-evaluate things and learn, a thing that LLMs cannot do and will never do. We do not know how to get to AGI. Sam Altman said in June that OpenAI was “now confident [they knew] how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it.” In August, Altman said that AGI was “not a super useful term,” and that “the point of all this is it doesn’t really matter and it’s just this continuing exponential of model capability that we’ll rely on for more and more things.” So, yeah, total bullshit. Even Meta’s Chief AI Scientist says it isn’t possible with transformer-based models. We don’t know if AGI is possible, anyone claiming they do is lying. This, too, is hogwash, nothing different than your buddy’s friend’s uncle who works at Nintendo that says Mario is coming to PlayStation. Ilya Sutskever and Mira Murati raised billions for companies with no product, let alone a product road map, and they did so because they saw a good opportunity for a grift and to throw a bunch of money at compute. Also: if someone from “deep within the AI industry” has told somebody “big things are coming,” they are doing so to con them or make them think they have privileged information. Ask for specifics. This argument is poised as a comeback to my suggestion that AI isn't particularly useful, a proof point that this movement is not inherently wasteful, or that there are, in fact, use cases for ChatGPT that are lasting, meaningful or important. I disagree. In fact, I believe ChatGPT — and LLMs in general — have been marketed based on lies of inference. Ironic, I know. I also have grander concerns and suspicions about what OpenAI considers a “user” and how it counts revenue, I’ll get into that later in the week on my premium newsletter, which you should subscribe to. Here’s a hint though: 500,000 of OpenAI’s “5 million business customers” are from its $15 million deal with Cal State University, which works out to around $2.50-a-user-a-month. It’s also started doing $1-a-month trials of its $30-a-month “Teams” subscription, and one has to wonder how many of those are counted in that total, and for how long. I do not know the scale of these offers, nor how long OpenAI has been offering them. A Redditor posted about the deal a few months ago, saying that OpenAI was offering up to 5 seats at once. In fact, I've found a few people talking about these deals, and even one adding that they were offered an annual $10-a-month ChatGPT Plus subscription, with one person saying a few weeks ago saying they'd seen people offered this deal for canceling their subscription. Suspicious. But there’s a greater problem at play. So, ChatGPT has 700 million weekly active users. OpenAI has yet to provide a definition — and yes, I've asked! — which means that an "active" user could be defined as somebody who has gone to ChatGPT once in the space of a week. This term is extremely flimsy, and doesn't really tell us much. Similarweb says that in July 2025 ChatGPT.com had 1.287 billion total visits, making it a very popular website. What do these facts actually mean, though? As I said previously, ChatGPT has had probably the most sustained PR campaign for anything outside of a presidency or a pop star. Every single article about AI mentions OpenAI or ChatGPT, every single feature launch — no matter how small — gets a slew of coverage. Every single time you hear "AI" you’re made to think of "ChatGPT” by a tech media that has never stopped to think about their role in hype, or their responsibility to their readers. And as this hype has grown, the publicity compounds, because the natural thing for a journalist to do when everybody is talking about something is to talk about it more. ChatGPT's immediate popularity may have been viral, but the media took the ball and ran with it, and then proceeded to tell people it did stuff it did not. People were pressured to try this service then under false pretenses, something that continues to this day. I'll give you an example. On March 15 2023, Kevin Roose of the New York Times would say that OpenAI's GPT-4 was "exciting and scary," exacerbating (his words!) "...the dizzy and vertiginous feeling I’ve been getting whenever I think about A.I. lately," wondering if he was experiencing "future shock," then described how it was an indeterminate level of "better" and something that immediately sounded ridiculous: In one test, conducted by an A.I. safety research group that hooked GPT-4 up to a number of other systems, GPT-4 was able to hire a human TaskRabbit worker to do a simple online task for it — solving a Captcha test — without alerting the person to the fact that it was a robot. The A.I. even lied to the worker about why it needed the Captcha done, concocting a story about a vision impairment. That doesn't sound remotely real! I went and looked up the paper, and here is the entire extent of what OpenAI shared: This safety card led to the perpetration of one of the earliest falsehoods — and most eagerly-parotted lies — that ChatGPT and generative AI is capable of "agentic" actions. Outlet after outlet — led by Kevin Roose — eagerly interpreted an entire series of events that took place that doesn't remotely make sense, starting with the fact that this is not something you can hire a Taskrabbit to do. Or, at the very least, without a contrived situation where you create an empty task and ask them to complete it. Why not use Mechanical Turk? Or Fiverr? They’ve tons of people offering this service! But I'm a curious little critter, so I went further and followed their citation to a link on METR's research page. It turns out that what actually happened was METR had a researcher copy paste the generated responses from the model and otherwise handle the entire interaction with Taskrabbit, and based on the plurality of "Taskrabbit contractors," it appears to have taken multiple tries. On top of that, it appears that OpenAI/METR were prompting the model on what to say, which kind of defeats the point. Emphases mine, and comments in [brackets]: It took me five whole minutes to find this piece — which is cited on the GPT-4 system card — read it, then write this piece. It did not require any technical knowledge other than the ability to read stuff. It is transparently, blatantly obvious that GPT-4 did not "hire" a Taskrabbit or, indeed, make any of these actions — it was prompted to, and they do not show the prompts they used, likely because they had to use so many of them. Anyone falling for this is a mark, and OpenAI should have gone out of its way to correct people. Instead, they sat back and let people publish outright misinformation. Roose, along with his co-host Casey Newton, would go on to describe this example at length on a podcast that week, describing an entire narrative where “the human actually gets suspicious” and “GPT 4 reasons out loud that it should not reveal that [it is] a robot,” at which point “the TaskRabbit solves the CAPTCHA.” During this conversation, Newton gasps and says “oh my god” twice, and when he asks Roose “how does the model understand that in order to succeed at this task, it has to deceive the human?” Roose responds “we don’t know, that is the unsatisfying answer,” and Newton laughs and states “we need to pull the plug. I mean, again, what?” Credulousness aside, the GPT-4 marketing campaign was incredibly effective, creating an aura that allowed OpenAI to take advantage of the vagueness of its offering as people — including members of the media — willfully filled in the blanks for them. Altman has never had to work to sell this product. Think about it — have you ever heard OpenAI tell you what ChatGPT can do, or gone to great lengths to describe its actual abilities? Even on OpenAI's own page for ChatGPT, the text is extremely vague: Scrolling down, you're told ChatGPT can "write, brainstorm, edit and explore ideas with you." It can "generate and debug code, automate repetitive tasks, and [help you] learn new APIs." With ChatGPT you can "learn something new...dive into a hobby...answer complex questions" and "analyze data and create charts." What repetitive tasks? Who knows. How am I learning? Unclear. It's got thinking built in! What that means is unclear, unexplained, and thus allows a user to incorrectly believe that ChatGPT has a brain. To be clear, I know what reasoning means, but this website does not attempt to explain what "thinking" means. You can also "offload complex tasks from start to finish with an agent," which can, according to OpenAI, "think and act, proactively choosing from a toolbox of agentic skills to complete tasks for you using its own computer." This is an egregious lie, employing the kind of weasel-wording that would be used to torture "I.R. Baboon" for an eternity. Precise in its vagueness, OpenAI's copy is honed to make reporters willing to simply write down whatever they see and interpret it in the most positive light. And thus the lie of inference began. What "ChatGPT" meant was muddied from the very beginning, and thus ChatGPT's actual outcomes have never been fully defined. What ChatGPT "could do" became a form of folklore — a non-specific form of "automation" that could "write code" and "generate copy and images," that can "analyze data," all things that are true but one can infer much greater meaning from. One can infer that "automation" means the automation of anything related to text, or that "write code" means "write the entirety of a computer program." OpenAI's ChatGPT agent is not, by any extension of the word, "already a powerful tool for handling complex tasks," but it has not, in any meaningful sense, committed to any actual outcomes. As a result, potential users — subject to a 24/7 marketing campaign — have been pushed toward a website that can theoretically do anything or nothing, and have otherwise been left to their own devices. The endless gaslighting, societal pressure, media pressure, and pressure from their bosses has pushed hundreds of millions of people to try a product that even its creators can't really describe. As I've said in the past, OpenAI is deliberately using Weekly Active Users so that it doesn't have to publish its monthly active users, which I believe would be higher. Why wouldn't it do this? Well, OpenAI has 20 million paying ChatGPT subscribers and five million "business customers," with no explanation of what the difference might be. This is already a mediocre (3.5%) conversion rate, yet its monthly active users (which are likely either 800 million or 900 million, but these are guesses!) would make that rate lower than 3%, which is pretty terrible considering everybody says this shit is the future. I also am tired of having people claim that "search" or "brainstorm" or "companions" are a lasting, meaningful business models. So, OpenAI announced that it has hit its first $1 billion month on August 20, 2025 on CNBC, which brings it exactly in line with my estimated $5.26 billion in revenue that I believe it has made as of the end of July. However, remember what the MIT study said: enterprise adoption is high but transformation is low. There are tons of companies throwing money at AI, but they are not seeing actual returns. OpenAI's growth as the single-most-prominent company in AI (and if we're honest, one of the most prominent in software writ large) makes sense, but at some point will slow, because the actual returns for the businesses aren't there. If there were, we'd have one article where we could point at a ChatGPT integration that at scale helped a company make or save a bunch of money, written in plain English and not a gobbledygook of "profit improvement." Also… OpenAI is projected to make $12.7 billion in 2025. How exactly will it do that? Is it really making $1.5 billion a month by the end of the year? Even if it does, is the idea that it keeps burning $10 billion or more every year into eternity? What actual revenue potential does OpenAI have long-term? Its products are about as good as everyone else's, cost about the same, and do the same things. ChatGPT is basically the same product as Claude or Grok or any number of different LLMs. The only real advantages that OpenAI has are infrastructure and brand recognition. These models have clearly hit a wall where training is hitting diminishing returns, meaning that its infrastructural advantage is that they can continue providing its service at scale, nothing more. It isn't making its business cheaper, other than the fact that it mostly hasn’t had to pay for it...other than the site in Abilene Texas where it’s promised Oracle $30 billion a year by 2028. I'm sorry, I don't buy it! I don't buy that this company will continue growing forever, and its stinky conversion rate isn't going to change anytime soon. How? Literally…how! How? How! HOW??? Nobody ever answers this question! “Efficiencies”? If you’re going to say GPT-5 — here’s a scoop I have about how it’s less efficient! It's very, very, very common for people to conflate "AI" with "generative AI." Make sure that whatever you're claiming or being told is actually about Large Language Models, as there are all sorts of other kinds of machine learning that people love to bring up. LLMs have nothing to do with Folding@Home, autonomous cars, or most disease research. A lot of people think that they're going to tell me "I use this all the time!" and that'll change my mind. I cannot express enough how irrelevant it is that you have a use case, as every use case I hear is one of the following: This would all be fine and dandy if people weren't talking about this stuff as if it was changing society. None of these use cases come close to explaining why I should be impressed by generative AI. It also doesn't matter if you yourself have kind of a useful thing that AI did for you once. We are so past the point when any of that matters. AI is being sold as a transformational technology, and I am yet to see it transform anything. I am yet to hear one use case that truly impresses me, or even one thing that feels possible now that wasn't possible before. This isn't even me being a cynic — I'm ready to be impressed! I just haven't been in three fucking years and it's getting boring. Also, tell me with a straight face any of this shit is worth the infrastructure. One of the most braindead takes about AI and coding is that "vibe coding" is "allowing anyone to build software." While technically true, in that one can just type "build me a website" into one of many AI coding environments, this does not mean it is functional or useful software. Let's make this really clear: AI cannot "just handle coding." Read this excellent piece by Colton Voege, then read this piece by Nik Suresh. If you contact me about AI and coding without reading these I will send them to you and nothing else, or crush you like a car in a garbage dump, one or the other. Also, show me a vibe coded company. Not a company where someone who can code has quickly spun up some features, a fully-functional, secure, and useful app made entirely by someone who cannot code. You won't be able to find this as it isn't possible. Vibe Coding is a marketing term based on lies, peddled by people who have either a lack of knowledge or morals. Are AI coding environments making people faster? I don't think so! In fact, a recent study suggested they actually make software engineers slower. The reason that nobody is vibe coding an entire company is because software development is not just "put a bunch of code in a pile and hit "go," and oftentimes when you add something it breaks something else. This is all well and good if you actually understand code — it's another thing entirely when you are using Cursor or Claude Code like a kid at an arcade machine turning the wheel repeatedly and pretending they're playing the demo. Vibe coders are also awful for the already negative margins of most AI coding environments, as every single thing they ask the model to do is imprecise, burning tokens in pursuit of a goal they themselves don't understand. "Vibe coding" does not work, it will not work, and pretending otherwise is at best ignorance and at worst supporting a campaign built on lies. If you are an AI booster, please come up with better arguments. And if you truly believe in this stuff, you should have a firmer grasp on why you do so. It's been three years, and the best some of you have is "it's real popular!" or "Uber burned a lot of money!" Your arguments are based on what you wish were true rather than what's actually true, and it's deeply embarrassing. Then again, there are many well-intentioned people who aren't necessarily AI boosters who repeat these arguments, regardless of how thinly-framed they are, in part because we live in a high-information, low-processing society where people tend to put great faith in people who are confident in what they say and sound smart. I also think the media is failing on a very basic level to realize that their fear of missing out or seeming stupid is being used against them. If you don't understand something, it's likely because the person you're reading or hearing it from doesn't either. If a company makes a promise and you don't understand how they'd deliver on it, it's their job to explain how, and your job to suggest it isn't plausible in clear and defined language. This has gone beyond simple "objectivity" into the realm of an outright failure of journalism. I have never seen more misinformation about the capabilities of a product in my entire career, and it's largely peddled by reporters who either don't know or have no interest in knowing what's actually possible, in part because all of their peers are saying the same nonsense. As things begin to collapse — and they sure look like they're collapsing, but I am not making any wild claims about "the bubble bursting" quite yet — it will look increasingly more deranged to bluntly publish everything that these companies say. Never have I seen an act of outright contempt more egregious than Sam Altman saying that GPT-5 was actually bad, and that GPT-6 will be even better. Members of the media: Sam Altman does not respect you. He is not your friend. He is not secretly confiding in you. He thinks you are stupid and easily-manipulated, and will print anything he says, largely in part because many members of the media will print exactly what he says whenever he says it. To be clear, if you wrote about it and actively mocked it, that's fine. But let's close by discussing the very nature of AI skepticism, and the so-called "void" between those who "hate" AI and those who "love" AI, from the perspective of one of the more prominent people in the "skeptic" side. Critics and skeptics are not given the benefit of grace, patience, or, in many cases, hospitality when it comes to their position. While they may receive interviews and opportunities to "give their side," it is always framed as the work of a firebrand, an outlier, somebody with dangerous ideas that they must eternally justify. They are demonized, their points under constant scrutiny, their allegiances and intentions constantly interrogated for some sort of moral or intellectual weakness. "Skeptic" and "critic" are words said with a sneer or trepidation — that the listener should be suspicious that this person isn't agreeing that AI is the most powerful, special thing ever. To not immediately fall in love with something that everybody is talking about is to be framed as a "hater," to have oneself introduced with the words "not everybody agrees..." on 40% of appearances. By comparison, AI boosters are the first to get TV appearances and offers to be on panels, their coverage featured prominently on Techmeme, selling slop-like books called shit like The Future Of Intelligence: Masters Of The Brain featuring 18 interviews with different CEOs that all say the same thing. They do not have to justify their love — they simply have to remember all the right terms, chirping out "test-time compute" and "the cost of inference is going down" enough times to summon Wario Amodei to give them an hour-long interview where he says "the models, they are, in years, going to be the most powerful school teacher ever built." And yeah, I did sell a book, because my shit fucking rocks. I have consistent, deeply-sourced arguments that I've built on over the course of years. I didn't "become a hater" because I'm a "contrarian," I became a hater because the shit that these fucking oafs have done to the computer pisses me off. I wrote The Man Who Killed Google Search because I wanted to know why Google Search sucked. I wrote Sam Altman, Freed because at the time I didn't understand why everybody was so fucking enamoured with this damp sociopath. Everything I do comes from genuine curiosity and an overwhelming frustration with the state of technology. I started writing this newsletter with 300 subscribers and 60 views, and have written it as an exploration of subjects that grows as I write. I do not have it in me to pretend to be anything other than what I am, and if that is strange to you, well, I'm a strange man, but at least I'm an honest one. I do have a chip on my shoulder, in that I really do not like it when people try to make other people feel stupid, especially when they do so as a means of making money for themselves or somebody else. I write this stuff out because I have an intellectual interest, I like writing, and by writing, I am able to learn about and process my complex feelings about technology. I happen to do so in a manner that hundreds of thousands of people enjoy every month, and if you think that I've grown this by "being a hater," you are doing yourself the disservice of underestimating me, which I will use to my advantage by writing deeper, more meaningful, more insightful things than you. I have watched these pigs ruin the computer again and again, and make billions doing so, all while the media celebrates the destruction of things like Google, Facebook, and the fucking environment in pursuit of eternal growth. I cannot manufacture my disgust, nor can I manufacture whatever it is inside me that makes it impossible to keep quiet about the things I see. I don't know if I take this too seriously or not seriously enough, but I am honoured that I am able to do it, and have 72,000 of you subscribed to find out when I do so. Subscribe today. It's free.

Title: AI’s $1 Trillion Shakeout: Bubble, Correction, Or Market Reset

ByMark Minevich, Contributor. In recent weeks, AI investors and enterprise leaders have felt the yo-yo effect of the AI market. Starting August 18, a four-day slide erased almost $1 trillion from the market caps of tech’s megacap companies. Nvidia, Palantir, and other so-called AI companies shed billions in value in a matter of days. Meta has announced a hiring freeze in its AI division. Even the CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, casually remarked that “AI is a bubble.” The irony? Engineers in the sector continue to command $100 million pay packages. AI startups continue to raise funding at valuations that defy gravity. Additionally, companies from Microsoft to Google are integrating AI features across their products at a record speed. The real question isn’t whether AI is a bubble. The better question is: what kind of bubble—if any—are we in, and what comes after? For much of the past 18 months, AI stocks soared based on projections and expectations. Nvidia tripled in value. Palantir’s valuations are reminiscent of the dot-com era. In August, the S&P’s price-to-book ratio reached 5.3, which is higher than the 2000 bubble peak. When valuations stretch that far, even small doubts can trigger outsized sell-offs. The rotation out of AI has been partly seasonal. August is historically weak for equities, and funds have been taking profits in overcrowded trades. However, the speed and depth of AI’s decline reveal something deeper: investors are finally asking tough questions about the business impact. New data fueled that scrutiny. A report from MIT showed that 95% of generative AI pilots fail to deliver any measurable return on investment. McKinsey research similarly found that while 8 in 10 companies deploy generative AI tools, most see no bottom-line gains. AI may be everywhere in boardrooms and demos, but it remains conspicuously absent from earnings statements. This fact is what caused markets to dip. The MIT statistic shouldn’t surprise seasoned executives. Many companies are treating AI as a marketing checkbox rather than a strategic capability. Money is being funneled into headline-grabbing initiatives, such as customer-facing chatbots and generative content tools. At the same time, the real ROI lies hidden in back-office automation, supply chain optimization, and finance functions. The most significant determinant of success isn’t the model itself, but how it’s adopted and integrated. Companies that prioritize impressive demos without redesigning workflows inevitably fail. By contrast, enterprises that embed AI into core processes (expense reporting, claims processing, compliance checks) consistently see measurable productivity gains. Another issue is the obsession with building in-house. For many organizations, partnering with trusted vendors provides faster time-to-value and avoids the talent bottleneck. Trying to replicate what OpenAI, Microsoft, or Google has already done internally often results in wasted human hours and failed pilots. Then there’s the problem of “agent sprawl.” As different departments spin up their own AI pilots, enterprises risk a patchwork of ungoverned tools, inconsistent security, and rising costs. Without a governance model that scales, these initiatives collapse under their own weight. The reality is that adoption strategy, not AI hype, determines ROI. The mixed signals coming from industry leaders further complicate the picture. Sam Altman’s “AI is a bubble” remark spooked investors, although insiders suggest his comments were directed at the valuations of huge startups, not giants like OpenAI or Nvidia. Some even speculate it was a tactical move, cooling off competitors such as Meta, which had been luring OpenAI engineers with $100 million signing packages. Meta’s AI hiring freeze may appear ominous on the surface, but the company is actually spending more than ever on AI infrastructure. The shift isn’t about retreat, but about moving from a talent land-grab to execution. In fact, Microsoft, Google, and Meta are quietly doubling down on AI integration across products that generate real revenue. Plus, Nvidia, despite stock swings, reported data center revenue up nearly 70% year-over-year. This further drives home the point that the infrastructure layer of AI is delivering tangible profits. The signs of a bubble are undeniable with valuations stretched to dot-com levels, engineers signing contracts worth nine figures and a 95% project failure rate in enterprise pilots. But there are equally strong signs that this is merely a correction. Unlike the dot-com era, today’s AI leaders are not speculative bets; they’re profitable, cash-rich companies building foundational technologies. Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google are not Pets.com. A more useful analogy may be the early internet. In 1995, valuations were huge, startups were burning cash, and most experiments failed. But beneath the noise, the infrastructure for a digital economy was being laid. The productivity payoff lagged the hype, but when it arrived, it reshaped the global economy. AI is following a similar trajectory. In the near term, volatility is unavoidable. Valuations will continue to be tested. Venture funding will tighten, forcing weak AI startups into consolidation or collapse. Public companies that heavily rely on AI marketing without demonstrating effective adoption will remain under pressure. The headlines and hype around $100 million salaries and “AI everywhere” marketing will cool. Many projects will be quietly wound down as the easy money phase of AI comes to an end. AI is not a feature, it is a general-purpose technology on par with electricity and the internet. It is already transforming healthcare, energy, finance, defense, logistics, and education. The productivity paradox is fundamental, as significant investments must come first and measurable gains follow later. Just as the internet required massive infrastructure before creating trillions in value, AI requires time to mature and integrate. By 2030, analysts project AI will add trillions of dollars to the global economy. Most startups will vanish, but the survivors (likely fewer than 5%) will dominate entire industries. The next decade will see the rise of new global giants, and the reshaping of competition across every sector. We’re not witnessing the end of AI, we’re witnessing the end of its hype cycle. The startup bubble is deflating. The talent war is cooling. But the underlying trend of AI as a driver of productivity, transformation, and new business models is only beginning. This is not a dot-com bus, but a recalibration of expectations. Execution will matter more than narrative. The adoption strategy will matter more than the experiments. Enterprises that focus on back-office productivity, integration, and governance will capture real ROI. In the short term, expect volatility, pain, and consolidation. In the long term, expect AI to weave into every industry and redefine productivity, creativity, and competition. Yes, some air is coming out, but AI itself is no bubble. The future belongs to AI. The only question is which enterprises will survive the shakeout and lead the next industrial revolution.

Title: AI Revolution Will Crush the Blue States

“The first step onto the corporate ladder is vanishing for many new graduates,” argued a recent Fortune report. As a result, CEOs are warning that entry-level jobs are on the brink of extinction, with internships and opportunities for college graduates drying up. Of course, not everyone will feel the impact in the same way. At the top of the pyramid are investors, entrepreneurs, and elite programmers who now command salaries on par with professional athletes. But artificial intelligence — fuelled by a huge infusion of Wall Street cash — threatens to eliminate many software jobs, along with high-end professional roles that involve routine analysis. Young people are acutely aware of this. In the class I teach with Marshall Koplansky at Chapman University, several students predicted that the jobs they currently hold will soon disappear. Among them were a game designer, two human-resources executives, and a manufacturing and warehouse manager. My engineering colleagues report a similar trend. While opportunities remain strong for mechanical and chemical engineers, as well as for those designing robotics, the outlook is far less certain for computer science students. Despite soaring profits at the largest tech companies, AI programming tools have enabled sweeping layoffs at firms such as Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Today, among college graduates aged 22-27, computer science and computer engineering majors face some of the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In response, many firms are now focusing on building tangible products rather than merely shifting algorithms for commerce or generating more social media. In the aerospace and defence sectors, for example, AI is seen not as an end but a tool. It is a means to enhance human creativity and productivity rather than replace it. “Software is not in the greatest position with AI,” Delian Asparouhov, who runs a firm focused on in-space manufacturing, told me. “Now people are shifting to hard tech. Designing and building spaceships still needs people.” This could spell trouble for elite universities, but represents a major advantage for schools that teach the practical skills companies actually need. So far, these opportunities are largely concentrated in red and purple states in the Midwest and South — the regions most focused on reshoring manufacturing and other industries from overseas. Attitudes are shifting alongside these economic changes. One recent survey found that roughly 83% of Generation Z feel that learning a skilled trade can be a better pathway to economic security than college — including 90% of those already holding college degrees. Indeed, as college enrolment has dropped between 2020 and 2023, trade school enrolment grew by 10%. These changes suggest that as practical skills gain value, regions offering them are likely to attract both talent and jobs. Read the rest of this piece at: UnHerd.
