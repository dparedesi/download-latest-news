Ordinary investors have won the battle of fees. The challenge will be holding on to that victory as Wall Street mounts a counteroffensive. Investing today is as easy as opening a free brokerage account and buying a low-cost, commission-free index fund that tracks the broad market, then sitting and marveling as it blossoms. Since I started my first professional job in the mid-1990s, an investment in a cheap S&P 500 Index fund would have grown more than 17-fold, beating virtually every professional investor over that time. For Wall Street, this has meant decades of falling fees, a trend that the industry now sees an opportunity to reverse. Financial firms are leveraging the hype around cryptocurrencies, artificial intelligence and private markets to lure investors back into high-priced funds. The campaign will be hard to resist. The Street is skilled at selling speculative, conveniently high-fee investments that promise — but rarely deliver — bigger payoffs than index funds can achieve. And with crypto, AI and private assets, there’s plenty of sizzle. Consider the patterns emerging in exchange-traded funds, an innovation that accelerated the low-cost revolution Vanguard Group Inc. sparked with the launch of the first index fund in the 1970s. The first ETF, State Street Corp.’s SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, launched in 1993 and is still among the most popular. In fact, the three biggest ETFs are S&P 500 funds with a combined $2 trillion in assets. The draw is an average expense ratio of just 0.05% a year and zero commissions to trade. The ETF revolution was built on a barrage of such low-cost market trackers. ETFs now have a 35% market share of combined US assets in ETFs and open-end mutual funds as of June from less than 1% through the 1990s, according to Morningstar. If the trend continues, there’s little doubt that ETFs will soon be the bigger player. But the products are in danger of losing their edge. The roughly 670 funds that launched in the 1990s and 2000s and are still around today have an asset-weighted average expense ratio of 0.13%, and nearly all of them are index funds. Since then, Wall Street has gradually encroached, turning what was a low-cost index haven into a high-priced casino. The average expense ratio of the 1,200 funds that launched in the 2010s crept up to 0.21%, and the percentage of index funds dipped to 75%. That was just a hint of the coming onslaught. Of the more than 2,500 ETFs that have launched so far this decade, only 25% are index funds. The group’s average expense ratio jumped to 0.39%, nearly matching that of mutual funds, which have been scrambling to lower fees. The direction is unmistakable — and unfavorable for investors. When the 2000s ended, there were only 25 ETFs with an expense ratio of 1% or more. In the 2010s, 73 more appeared. And so far this decade, I count an additional 272 that have already gathered $40 billion in assets. They are almost exclusively the kind of speculative funds you would expect — digital assets, inverse and leveraged, derivatives-based and emerging technologies (read AI). The only ones likely to get rich from these ETFs are the fund companies. More enticements are coming. The White House is reportedly readying an executive order that will open 401(k)s to private assets and cryptocurrencies. The mutual funds in retirement plans are already more expensive than comparable ETFs. Imagine how much more private assets and crypto funds will siphon from workers’ retirement savings. Financial firms that genuinely believe in the investment merit of crypto, AI and private assets should charge fees that are comparable to stock and bond index funds. They’ll still make plenty of money given the popularity of those investments. BlackRock Inc.’s recently launched iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF charges 0.25% a year and is already the firm’s most profitable ETF. There’s no reason why Vanguard’s highly anticipated private asset fund can’t conform to the firm’s low-cost ethos. Whatever happens, investors will still be able to build wealth steadily and reliably with low-cost index funds that track broad markets. They have already served generations of savers faithfully and will continue to — if investors can just overlook Wall Street’s high-priced temptations.

Title: Nothing Phone 3 Review: A Quirky and Fun Phone for Photographers
URL: https://petapixel.com/2025/07/25/nothing-phone-3-review-a-quirky-and-fun-phone-for-photographers/

Full Content:
Nothing ventured, nothing gained. As a brand hailing from Britain, Nothing has been around since 2020, and the Phone 3 is its first true flagship aimed at taking on the best in the industry. The company’s name is a wide-open door for puns, but nevertheless, Nothing could be a serious contender in the Android space going forward. Its current rise reminds me a lot of the earlier years of OnePlus, which isn’t all that surprising since both were founded by the same man, Carl Pei. He left OnePlus and started up Nothing as a grassroots alternative in a similar vein. This is a first for me, as I hadn’t tested a Nothing phone prior to this, and one with a daring camera setup makes for an ideal start. The Phone 3 is readily available in North America starting at $800, yet also has the pedigree of Chinese brands to some extent. How it all comes together yields intriguing and vexing results. The Phone 3’s physical design is open to interpretation. Does it look like a science experiment or a crafty take on otherwise common builds from others? For my eyes, it’s a unique look that’s easy enough to cover up with a case if a little too eccentric, though I personally don’t mind it at all. I also appreciate that Nothing includes a basic silicone case in the box to add some protection from the start, retaining the transparent back’s visibility with Gorilla Glass Victus offering its own layer of durability. Another unique element is the small red square that is actually an LED that lights up when recording video. One of the standout design elements is what Nothing calls its Glyph Interface, a circular LED display on the top corner that functions almost as an independent system. By default, it tells the time, stopwatch, and timer, battery level, and an odd spin-the-bottle game. It can do much more when making adjustments in the settings to include volume indicators, charging progress, and tying certain glyph animations to specific apps. For instance, you have one for WhatsApp, another for Uber, and yet another for email. I wasn’t able to create one for the Camera app that actually worked, so it’s more of a boon to the rest of the phone. Certainly a gimmicky feature, to a degree, but I’ve grown to like it because it makes it easier to leave the phone face down. The fact I can also set a “rule” for an animation to pop up when a specific contact messages me is convenient, though my smartwatch can effectively do the same thing in real time. On the flip side, the 6.77-inch AMOLED display (2800 x 1260) is gorgeous, with an adaptive refresh rate that will ramp up to 120Hz or down to 10Hz depending on what you’re doing onscreen. Peak brightness (for HDR content) hits 4,500 nits. While pretty visible in bright sunlight, it’s also fairly reflective, so a mixed bag in that regard. A responsive fingerprint sensor makes it relatively easy to bypass the lock screen. With IP68 dust and water resistance, this is Nothing’s first phone you can submerge in clear water, making it far less risky to capture some stills or clips at a pool or lake. Nothing also makes a curious choice to go with the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 processor over the 8 Elite other Android flagships adopted this year. Indeed, Qualcomm refers to the 8s Gen 4 chip as an “affordable flagship”, which is marketing speak for a step down in performance, but it’s also more in line with other devices in this price range. A 5,150mAh battery is adequate for a device this size, and it holds up quite well in daily real-world conditions, consistently lasting a full day. Configurations start at 12GB of RAM and 256GB and go up to 16GB and 512GB, respectively. The 50-megapixel main camera (24mm equivalent) uses the same OmniVision OV50H Type 1/1.3-inch sensor as the Vivo X Fold 3 and Honor Magic 7 Pro. The f/1.7 aperture is also in line with both devices, so we have an idea of what to expect from it. Unless you shoot at full resolution, all photos are downsampled to 12.5 megapixels through pixel binning. The 50-megapixel telephoto (70mm equivalent) goes with the Samsung Isocell JN5 Type 1/2.76-inch sensor with f/2.7 aperture — one we’ve seen in a myriad of phones over the last three years. In certain modes, Nothing offers a 6x hybrid zoom 140mm equivalent that’s basically a crop of the telephoto’s focal range. While you can shoot at full resolution at 3x (70mm), you can’t do it zooming in further than that. Otherwise, you have to settle for pixel-binned 12.5-megapixel shots. Finally, the 50-megapixel ultra-wide uses the Samsung Isocell JN1 Type 1/2.76-inch sensor with an f/2.2 aperture, a sensor that is fairly common among other brands. Unlike the other two rear lenses, this one isn’t stabilized and is fixed focus, limiting its versatility. This also applies to the 50-megapixel front camera, which uses the exact same sensor and specs. Instead of a separate mode for shooting full-resolution images, you select the resolution from the drop-down menu. The problem is that it inevitably resets to the lower resolution after a while with no warning, so if you’re walking around snapping photos along the way, you’re forced to double-check that 50MP capture is still active. This happened to me a few times, and I was lucky enough to catch it without losing the high-res capture I wanted. Unfortunately, that’s the only way to go full-res, since Expert mode only lets you shoot in RAW with pixel binning. This can pay dividends in low-light conditions, but otherwise feels pointless in brighter settings or when capturing a dramatic landscape. For a flagship, it feels far too limiting. Nothing presents a few interesting software elements that can affect how you take photos with the Phone 3. Tap the bottom arrow in the camera app, and various presets appear in a menu, including Black and White Film, Retro, Soft Focus, and Lenticular. What’s really neat is it lets you import or create your own. To import, simply scan the QR code to add it to the list. Another way is to create a .cube file to bring in a LUT or preset from apps like Lightroom and DaVinci Resolve (among others) by uploading it directly from the phone’s camera app. Simply select the filter menu from the drop-down menu, tap the + icon and you have the ability to bring it in, either from local storage or pulled in from Google Drive. Yet another option is to create a preset from any photo, even if you’ve transferred or downloaded it from elsewhere. Why make all this available? The phone’s Gallery app has a decent editing toolset, except it lacks any sort of curve tool or deeper color grading. I tried this out in different ways, one of which was to use the Gallery app first, upload to Lightroom to work on the finer details more accurately, and then download the result back to the phone. That way, I could create a preset using the color grading that the phone and its imaging pipeline would then work to emulate. While not a perfect solution, it is one of the more interesting methodologies I’ve seen that caters to mobile photographers of all stripes. It’s also the most creative outlet in a device that otherwise ignores AI-driven editing features or special modes. The Phone 3 isn’t devoid of AI, however, and one feature tied to the Essential Key — the button under the power button on the phone — is applicable to photography. Press the button with anything onscreen and you can write down a note or ask a question for context. This is great for two reasons. First, it makes it a lot easier to snap a quick photo as a reminder or to look something up. Second, it opens up access to contextual information with the assistance of ChatGPT. To test out a good example, I used a photo I took of the lunar eclipse and asked it when the next eclipse would be. It then listed the upcoming dates for both partial and full lunar eclipses based on my location. It’s true that Google’s Circle to Search essentially does the same thing, only the key difference here is that all of these Essential Key screenshots save to the Essential Spaces app. It essentially (pun intended) acts as an offline resource that’s always there to reference anytime. Granted, it’s far from perfect, as evidenced by the fact that it doesn’t always offer much insight, but it can be great at helping find information. On the other hand, ask it to suggest how to make a photo look better, and it won’t offer much insight at all. I will address the two main sticking points for the camera before discussing the positives. There’s a noticeable shutter lag that afflicts every mode except Action and Video. In some cases, it’s so bad that it can take up to two full seconds before it snaps the image. It’s also inconsistent in ways that are hard to discern or explain. I could never figure out why it would be slow to capture a photo in outdoor settings, only to feel much more instantaneous when taking other shots in the same general area. I will update this review once Nothing responds to queries, but if I were to take a stab at it, I would guess that the HDR processing engine immediately sets how many images it needs to quickly snap and merge. The other issue is lens flare and ghosting. Nothing needs to look at whatever coating it’s using for the Phone 3’s lenses because it happens in varying scenarios where it doesn’t impact other phones in the same spots. The photo of the rabbit is a good example of how it can create glare that not only hazes the composition but also plants ugly ghosting in the frame. All I was trying to do was lower the perspective to get a more interesting shot, but the flaring never let up. Meanwhile, two competitors’ phones didn’t seem to suffer from the same problem. Nothing has just released a firmware update to improve its Ultra XDR processing and address this issue. I’ll update this review if that leads to better results. Those two significant drawbacks aside, the Phone 3 surprised me in good ways, with the Action mode turning out to be one of the biggest gems. Nothing wisely offers it in both the main and telephoto cameras, and much like other competing phones with a similar feature, the idea here is to increase shutter speed and utilize HDR processing to manipulate both ISO and virtual aperture to freeze everything. Tougher lighting conditions get in the way, yet broad daylight can lead to fabulous results. The skateboarder is a good example — not only did I take the shot with the telephoto lens, I also cropped in further and retained good detail. Action doesn’t support burst shooting (only Photo mode does), but quickly tapping the shutter can deliver multiple good shots. Equally impressive is the way the Phone 3 handles HDR, although time of day and light exposure play a significant role. It may struggle to pull out the blues in the sky on a bright sunny vista, only to then wonderfully subdue the sun’s intensity in a horizon sunset. When it works well, you love having that kind of power in your pocket, despite how it cuts both ways. One thing I appreciate is that the Phone 3 handles exposed light sources well enough to avoid outright clipping or underexposing shadows — again, owing to the Ultra XDR’s efficacy. However, the angle is your only real defense against flare or glare creeping in, so tilting ever so slightly might be enough to ward it off in those instances because it can happen indoors or outdoors. General results will look great on a phone screen, though you may notice more imperfections when pixel peeping. It’s one of those things where really good photos are obvious and forgettable clunkers equally so. That’s not to say the Phone 3 is inconsistent, more that it nudges you to use some of the available tools to close the gap. The telephoto lens is a great example of what I’m referring to, mainly because it sometimes captures brilliance and then mediocrity all in one sitting. It impresses more often than not, but I would like to see more consistency. For one thing, you could take two shots from the same vantage point and come out with different color tones in each. Blue skies are the most obvious example of when this happens, though other rich examples, like foliage, vehicles, and graffiti, can lead to similar results. Despite all that, I leaned heavily on the telephoto to get me the shots I wanted from a distance. Even the 10x hybrid zoom (240mm equivalent) can produce a decent result with the help of AI Zoom when it kicks in. It also doubles as a macro shooter and accords itself well in that role. Rich and detailed, it’s one of the more surprising elements to the broader camera system. This ultra-wide sensor has been around for a while, and it shows. The lack of both OIS and broader focusing tend to affect performance but it’s more that the XDR processing just isn’t as effective here. While it is a 50-megapixel sensor, Nothing doesn’t let you shoot with it in full-res where you might salvage some detail in good lighting. Apart from the LUTs and presets, this is one of the main anchors for the camera system. It can produce action shots that simply aren’t possible on an iPhone or Samsung phone without doing a lot more work. Action mode takes both multiple photos and a super short video clip in the backend to help render a still that freezes a subject in motion. We’ve seen this sort of thing from OnePlus, Xiaomi, Vivo, and Honor before, but it’s yet to truly catch on from the likes of Apple, Samsung, and Google. As I noted earlier, it’s also the fastest shutter available on the camera app. Rapidly pressing the button enables you to capture the action in fairly short intervals — under a second long — to increase the chance of capturing something dynamic. The one caveat is the subject’s speed. People and (most) animals are easier, whereas objects can be tougher to precisely nail down at higher velocities. Mind you, distance also matters like it does with any action photography, so the same rules generally apply here, too. In low-light conditions, including indoors, you have to watch out for ramped-up ISO to offset the higher shutter speed, which could lead to a noisier result. I focused more on still photography, but also tried out video. For whatever reason, Nothing doesn’t enable using the same LUTs and presets to capture footage. Select a preset, and it reverts right back to Photo mode. Otherwise, you can record in 4K or Full HD resolution at 30p or 60p frame rates. The only other video modes are Slo-Mo and Time-lapse. Video quality is quite good in ideal settings, and with HDR mode, you have the option to record in H.265 for extra control in post-production, if desired. The Nothing Phone 3 is in an interesting spot. The brand doesn’t have the kind of imaging partnerships Chinese brands have, nor is it a household name in North America like the Big 3. NothingOS is one of the best Android overlays I’ve seen for the simple fact it strongly resembles stock Android. The build quality and hardware are solid, and battery life is excellent, so this phone ticks off a lot of the right boxes. I can understand how some might view the cameras as a drag on the overall package, especially given the competition at similar prices. But for an upstart brand trying its hand at a flagship, this is a very good debut. I tested the Nothing Phone 3 at the same time as the Vivo X200 FE, and the latter proved to be a more capable shooter in varying circumstances. On the flip side, NothingOS is a pleasure compared to Funtouch OS. The OnePlus 13R is closer in both price and performance in that it lacks Hasselblad’s input, and is a worthy option given how good OxygenOS is as an Android overlay. The Xiaomi 15 may cost a bit more but it retains many of the imaging trappings of the Ultra model. The upcoming Xiaomi 15T Pro (or something similar) may also be in the same wheelhouse. The Honor 400 is compelling as a cheaper option — except if you want a telephoto lens, get the Pro version. Maybe. NothingOS is a draw for sure because software is so vitally important to our daily interactions with phones. It’s not clear how much Nothing will try to fix on the camera side through further updates but if you like something fun and quirky, the Phone 3 is it.

Title: The S&P 500 is ‘extremely concentrated,’ Apollo economist says, warning the best AI investment may not be in the Magnificent 7

Sasha Rogelberg is a reporter and former editorial fellow on the news desk at Fortune, covering retail and the intersection of business and popular culture. It’s time to question the soundness of continued zealous investment in the Magnificent Seven, one top economist warns. The S&P 500 has become “extremely concentrated,” with the top 10 stocks contributing 54% of market returns since January 2021, Apollo chief economist Torsten Sløk said in a Friday blog post. With the cluster of tech stocks at the top beginning to unravel, he is pouring cold water on continued aggressive investment in the index and in the Magnificent Seven. “The textbook idea that the S&P 500 gives you a diversified exposure to risk is just simply no longer the case,” Sløk told Fortune. “You are very focused and concentrated in a small group of names, in particular in tech, making up such a significant share of your overall risk exposure.” The top 10 companies in the S&P 500 now prop up 40% of the index’s market capitalization—more than 30% of which is from the Mag Seven—meaning the fortune of the markets has become increasingly reliant on investor optimism about AI. Alphabet’s AI rally not only helped mint CEO Sundar Pichai as a billionaire, for example, but the Google parent’s earnings beat gave the S&P 500 its fourth consecutive record close on Thursday. But as the AI bubble swells larger than the IT bubble a quarter-century ago, as Sløk has previously noted, the extreme hype around the technology risks creating even broader economic consequences than the dotcom crisis. To protect one’s individual investments, now is the time to reconsider pouring money into the Mag Seven, Sløk argued. “One should have some exposure to the S&P 500 and should certainly also have some exposure to AI,” Sløk said. “But it’s very clear that [owing to] the market’s extreme focus and concentration on this story, this is the time to have a conversation around, What are the things I should be doing with my money?” Mounting concerns over the ramifications of a growing AI bubble coincide with the unraveling of the Magnificent Seven stocks. “We’re beginning to have conversations about the ‘Magnificent Six,’ maybe it’s only five,” Sløk said. “This is also just telling you that the Magnificent Seven are seven very, very different companies that have very different businesses.” Popularized in 2023 by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett, the “Magnificent Seven” term acknowledged a group of companies alike in their goal of pushing toward an AI future, but these seven firms, once in lockstep, are beginning to diverge in their levels of success and areas of investment. Apple, for example, has lagged behind competitors like Microsoft and Meta in developing AI products and services. With its stock down about 12% year to date, some market watchers have called for CEO Tim Cook to step down, despite Cook’s boosting the stock price by nearly 1,500% over the past decade-plus. Tesla has meanwhile failed to deliver on promises of autonomous driving, continuing this week its streak of sales misses and disappointing quarters. Tesla’s stock has fallen nearly 15% in 2025 as investor confidence in CEO Elon Musk continues to be tested. Nvidia this month became the first publicly traded company with a more than $4 trillion valuation as its stock price surged by approximately 1,460% over the past five years. The company is expected to see strong sales growth, despite increasing competitive pressures. Ahead of next week’s earnings reports for Meta, Apple, and Microsoft, analysts are continuing to scrutinize the pricing of these companies’ stocks, assessing if there are other options in the tech sector worth buying into. “AI will continue to have a dramatic impact on all our lives,” Sløk wrote in his blog post. “But the question remains whether the Magnificent Seven are correctly priced, and if they will even be the best AI investments over the next five to 10 years.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Yes – Goldman Sachs is on the prowl for acquisitions, and it isn’t alone on Wall Street – but they may not be the deals you’ve been reading about. The speculation about Goldman buying Northern Trust (yes, I have been reporting it for years) is, at this point, likely nothing more than that, sources told On The Money. Northern Trust shares are up 20% on the chatter, but its CEO has been dismissive – and so are the people at Goldman, I am told. For one, Goldman CEO David Solomon doesn’t like overpaying, which is exactly what he’d have to do at this point to get Northern Trust to sell. I’ve also been told Goldman’s culture is too weirdly unique for it to combine with another same-sized bank. On that latter note: Solomon also isn’t looking to be the CEO who will cede control to a bigger player. Other deals, however, will happen at Goldman and elsewhere in banking. That’s right: Wall Street is rife with high-level bank merger discussions. They may or may not lead to a transaction, but the talks have officially begun, people with direct knowledge of the matter said. The reason is a lighter regulatory approach by the Federal Reserve prodded by the more deal-friendly Trump administration that will allow large to mid-sized banks – stymied for years by post-financial crisis guardrails – to expand. True, you probably won’t see two large “systemically important” banks like Jamie Dimon’s JP Morgan buying up Goldman. But both JPMorgan and Goldman will be able to do significant, albeit smaller deals, my banking sources say. “Because of the Fed’s supervisory relaxation big bank deals are going to happen,” said one financial-service chief executive who asked not to be named. “Everyone is talking.” As I have reported, Solomon knows he needs to grow his smallish, but powerful investment house. Its market cap is $221 billion compared to more than $830 billion at JPMorgan. It could use heft and scale if it wants to remain relevant well into the future. One possible target for Goldman: State Street Corp., a mid-sized bank with around $30 billion in market value. It’s digestible and it is strong where many of the bigger players would like to be, like custodian services and various types of investment services (A State Street spokesman had no immediate comment). Another potential target for Goldman: the mid-sized BNY, formerly known as Bank of New York Mellon. Both companies have already announced a joint venture to offer “tokenized” money market funds, a precursor to a true merger later. People close to Goldman tell me a more immediate deal could be in the private credit or non-bank lenders space. BlackRock dived head first into private credit, snapping up HPS Investment Partners in 2024. CEO Larry Fink sees private credit booming and will soon offer retail investors products where they can get such exposure in their 401(k)s. A Goldman spokesman had no comment. A BNY rep declined comment. Meanwhile, Citigroup, after years of turmoil following its near demise during the 2008 financial crisis, is ripe to do a deal. Finally, its balance sheet has improved enough to give the Fed some assurance it has the capital to digest dealmaking.

Never miss a story. CEO Jane Fraser is impressing investors with her turnaround of the nation’s third largest bank (based on assets) and she now has the resources to combine with possibly a European bank that could enhance Citi’s strong point, which has always been its international footprint. (A Citi rep also declined to comment.) The giant Swiss bank UBS is also said to be on the prowl for US bank assets, On The Money has learned. This comes after its 2024 forced merger of the beleaguered Credit Suisse that Swiss banking regulators believed was needed to prevent a collapse of CS. “UBS is very aggressive to do a US deal to reduce its Swiss exposure,” my CEO source said. A UBS rep had no immediate comment. This is far from an exhaustive list and combos are all subject to change. But deal-making is in the air. Advertisement

Title: How A Podcast "Created Lot Of Problems" For Diamond Comics Bankruptcy

Posted in: Comics, Current News | Tagged: dennis barger, diamond The Diamond Comic Distributors' Chapter 11 bankruptcy court transcripts reveal the how a podcast "created a lot of problems" Transcripts of previous court sessions in the Diamond Comic Distributors Chapter 11 bankruptcy case have been unsealed. And, amongst other things, concern the appearance of Alliance Entertainment (or AENT) CEO Bruce Ogilvie on the Industry Of Comics comic book retailer podcast withBryan McClay, Dennis Barger and Jesse James. And how it may have created complications for AENT's initial auction win. When the Diamond Chapter 11 Bankruptcy auction at Raymond James offices was finalised, the winner was announced as Alliance Entertainment/AENT. Bruce Ogilvie, AENT chairman, was then invited onto the podcast after, apparently, watching my performance on it the previous week, talking about the Diamond situation. He also talked about the company, how he came independently to the Diamond auction, why he bid what he did, how the auction went, and his plans for Diamond as the winner. But then suddenly Diamond declared that the back-up bidders Universal Alliance and Pop Sparkle were the winners instead, and it descended into court reversals, lawsuits, and accusations, which are still playing out now. AENT, after being confirmed as the winner by the courts, withdrew from buying Diamond a short time later, claiming fraud, and has now launched a lawsuit for costs. On the 7th of April, Diamond Comic Distributor Inc, the debtors in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Diamond Comics were represented in court by Mark Minuti of Saul Ewing, Alliance Entertainment or AENT, represented by Jason Teele, the Creditors' Committee represented by Gianfranco Finizio, and the DIP lender JPMorgan Chase, represented by Katherine Culbertson, with other creditors such as The Pokémon Company International and Bandai Namco present. Again, we returned to AENT, winning the auction and beating out Universal Distribution and Ad Populum. Only for disputes over the inclusion, or not, of $4.3 million in prepaid inventory, leading to the debtor's decision to proceed with Universal and Ad Populum as the "highest and best" bid. We know that AENT win this court battle, before rejecting their victory shortly afterwards. Bleeding Cool has previously reported on the impact this podcast made, now we have cold hard proof in terms of witnesses taking the stand, with allegations that he essentially spoke out of turn, before the details of the sale had been finalized, and caused disruption in the comic book community. Robert Gorin of the Debtors took to the stand and talked about his reaction to seeing Bruce Ogilvie talk about his win, publicly. "So the day after the auction ends, that very next day, chairman of Alliance goes on a video on YouTube for a transaction that's not yet papered and starts talking about plans of what's going to happen. That created a lot of problems — as an operator, that created a lot of issues based on the messages that were interpreted, that were heard, that were said on that call. One was a conversation about consolidating warehouses. So the current organisation has five warehouses, and there was a conversation with the chairman about consolidating warehouses. As you can imagine, the calls started to come in from employees: Am I out of work? Do I not have a job? I don't understand. I'm very concerned… And so now, at a time when the company is very vulnerable, we're trying desperately to keep this thing together, we're really continuing to kind of almost duct tape the aeroplane while we're flying it, if you will. Now we have a lot of noise that we got to deal with. Retailers are calling the company and saying, I've got to get my stuff within a certain period of time. I need it in 24 to 48 hours upon my order. If you're going to consolidate, how are you going to get it to me that quickly? And so it created those issues. And then vendors wanted to know, are you still doing business with me, you're consolidating, the video was unclear about our comic, are you moving forward in the comic book world and what we call floppies. And, you know, with that, the employees on the print side want to know, do I have a job? And it's a really tough conversation when you're trying to convince somebody to continue to work, to be motivated, that this is ultimately a very good thing. And they're seeing this externally, and they're saying, I don't even know if I'm going to have a job. What am I supposed to do now? Should I immediately go out and start to look for a job? And so it created a lot of distraction, heartache, and I'll call it lack of focus within the organisation." In later testimony, he broke these down a little. "First of all, we don't have an agreement papered, right? We don't even have a draft…. Second of all, there was conversation about what went on in the auction that was not necessarily public information that I don't know needed to be shared. The chairman started to give opinions of what he thought was going to happen, even saying, "I'm not very familiar with comics, that's not something I'm well-versed in, I don't know the company very well, but clearly they're not doing it right because look where they are". And he began to give opinions about, for instance, the warehouses. He talked about price points and mentioned, we don't really want to deal in five-dollar price points. Most comic books are under $5 so that created an atmosphere of, well that means he's not going to do comic books. If he wants 15, $20 price points and above, he's not really interested in doing comic books, that's a fair piece of our business." It is something that did cause some consternation at the time, it's true. Gorin continued, "He talked about the collectible grading business. He said he didn't really know a lot about it. He said that they didn't visit that site… the basic message was that they had messed up the grading business somehow. The general indication was that there was a real problem there, but indicating that he hadn't spent a lot of time on it." And there was Free Comic Book Day, with Gorin revealing his own comic book history. "Your Honor, as a long-time comic book collector, it's a big day. You wait in line, you go, and you wait in line… There could be, you know, a couple hundred people in line. And it's an exciting day. And I think retailers have come to value it significantly. And that's one of the biggest questions we've received since this whole thing started: what about Free Comic Book Day? That's going to continue, right? I mean, that's one of the biggest questions we've received." And Gorin did not like what Ogilvie said about it at all. "He says that it clearly hasn't been monetized correctly, you haven't made any money on it. I believe there's a statement along the lines of "there's no free CD or free record album day" or something along the line that caused both the staff that work on Free Comic Book Day, and retailers to really become concerned that this was not part of the future, that this would not continue." Then there were the warehouses. "He used Amazon as an example and talked about how you want to have one big warehouse rather than having multiple small warehouses, and the scale and scope and benefit that gives you. Well, at the current time, we have five warehouses spread across the country. And they're spread strategically so that when an order is received, particularly on the Alliance game side, any order can be delivered to any retailer within 48 hours, 24 to 48 hours. And so the concept of now consolidating warehouses into potentially one large warehouse had the retailers concerned because now retailers closer to where the warehouse is situated have a potential advantage over other retailers." Also the Diamond staff. "It creates concern because now employees are wondering if they should stay. And that became a very loud topic within the company. Do I stay? Do I leave? You know, I have to take care of my family. If I don't have a job, you know, within a few weeks, I need to do something about that. Do I leave? You know, I have to take care of my family. If I don't have a job, you know, within a few weeks, I need to do something about that. It created concern with vendors saying, well, I can't really tell what your business model's going to be going forward. Maybe it's not a good idea for me to continue selling you product, which makes it difficult to then supply product to the retailer. So it created a lot of noise and a lot of distraction at a time when we're trying to be hyper-focused, we're trying to keep this organisation running as best we can, so that the next version of the organisation can blossom. Created concern for me that perhaps, you know, other backup bidders might say you've now had loss of value, your sales could be potentially down, or you don't have the same relationships… because they're distributors, they're selling relationships. And now all of those relationships are in flux because people are not sure, they can't have a fulsome conversation with the relationships on the other side, with third parties. It was a difficult few days from an operational perspective." In cross-examination from AENT's lawyer, Gorin stated that it wasn't the podcast per se that caused all the issues but that, "some of the items that I talked about predate the auction. And when you look at all these individually, okay, things happen. But when you start to add them all up, you get a feeling… I said that in my best business judgment, adding all of those things together, the best opportunity to close was the backup." And he did admit that as a result of the podcast, he wasn't aware of any employees quitting, retailers stopping selling Diamond products, or vendors stopping doing business with Diamond, just that it created "angst in the marketplace and within the company, it created additional noise that we had to deal with above and beyond the day-to-day running of the company. And already holding everything together with the concerns that were out there, it magnified the concerns." In later testimony, Gorin said that his concern was for employees being worried about their job, and it wasn't just the podcast reach, it was, well, me. A bit. "First of all, there were articles published about that. People download the podcast, and pieces of it were being shared. There were summaries that were being shared, you know, people who were watching it and sending around salient points that they thought were critical for various employees or etcetera to understand that was being shared. So the damage was well beyond the number of people who watched the podcast." Apparently, a tree falling in a forest does make a sound, even if there are only a few hundred views of it on YouTube. More to come… You can use these Diamond tabs to keep up with the latest on Bleeding Cool. Here's a timeline if you want to catch up… Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!

Title: Calls to replace Tim Cook as Apple CEO are getting louder every quarter – analyst

Update font size. Reset A Wall Street analyst advises caution on Apple stock due to the company’s unclear artificial intelligence strategy, particularly in generative AI. Needham’s Laura Martin warns that Apple risks lagging behind Big Tech competitors if it doesn’t clarify its AI approach, potentially jeopardizing Tim Cook’s job. Patrick Seitz for Investor’s Business Daily: ‎ “Apple must articulate a GenAI action plan,” Martin said in a client note Friday. “Apple is 1-2 years behind its Big Tech competitors, so any GenAI plan will be expensive to catch up through higher costs to the P&L and higher capex, and maybe even an acquisition.” Further, if it doesn’t act, tech talent will leave Apple to work for big players in artificial intelligence such as Meta Platforms, OpenAI, Anthropic and others, she said. “We believe that Apple’s share price will fall once investors understand the investment levels required to catch up with the other Big Tech conglomerates that were early adopters of GenAI,” Martin said. Lack of a clear AI strategy could even cost Chief Executive Tim Cook his job, she said. “Press and Wall Street’s calls to replace Tim Cook as Apple CEO are getting louder every quarter that Apple doesn’t lay out a comprehensive GenAI strategy,” Martin said. “With Apple shares down 14% year to date (vs S&P 500 up 8%), it’s clear to us that investors are insisting that Apple get off the sidelines.” ‎ MacDailyNews Take: Not loud enough, yet. ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

Apple won’t get serious about fixing itself until it can figure out how to do so by way of obnoxious leftwing virtue signaling. Analysts always conveniently dish up anything they like to account for stocks going up or down. In this case the analyst conveniently ignores the effects on Apple stock of tariffs imposted by the tangerine tyrant. If the haters want to get rid of Tim Cook the path forward is easy for them. Buy up a majority of Apple stock and vote him out. Calls getting louder …. predictable. That is what whiners do. No facts required. The guy that many here pushed as a candidate to lead Apple is currently presiding over an implosion in his company, with stock plummeting 21.7% so far this year, with no turnaround in sight. He’s also a known drug addict, philanderer, and had a major falling out with the POTUS. This beleaguered cyte has a worse track record than Steve Jobs in picking effective long term leaders. The other guy some other out-of-touch people keep bringing up was an arrogant ass who, after bungling Maps and blaming others, finally got himself canned. No other tech firm hired him, and he’s been out of the industry for many years. Sorry but production of a play doesn’t quite impress on a resume for someone who wants to run a multinational corporation. Who’s the “known drug addict, philanderer and faller-out?” It sure appears TC is the subject, but you’re bringing news with those nouns. Let’s not forget; in addition to the “many here,” Jobs picked The Cyte (is that supposed to be derogatory?) and both figures have effectively been the leaders of the once richest co of the World. You don’t like Mr. Broadway either. Prescience and brilliance almost requires you make public who the next, best and inevitable leader is to be? Who’s a whiner? I’m not a fan of The Cell either, btw. It’s only a matter of time before he goes. However the question arises as to how much more damage he will cause to the company its innovation and product line. It’s not just Tim Cook who needs to be replaced.he’s populated the senior positions with those who seem to lack the vision for innovation and are content to keep on leveraging the revenue from an existing product range until it runs out Nokia Ericsson Motorola etc the difference is Steve jobs and Johny Ive gifted Cooke a range of products to play with so he can continue the game longer. It’s time to go now and he should show some respect for the customers and investors. Investors are fluid individuals and may be willing to extract as much value as long as the party lasts before moving on. Pity this company and brand has a long way to go with the rights leadership As an add on maybe it’s time to invite Elon Musk on to the the board of apple get rid of the woke nonsense get back to basic innovation and brain storming and sideline the Oscar’s as this seems to be Tim Cookes main driver. Is it worthy of celebration the F1 is scoring well at the box office but apple intelligence and Siri are completely stalled?Just look at the headlines on Macdaily for the last month how many refer to movies and tv shows this website is not Variety it’s a site promoting a technology servicing company – many will say this is not what apple is but whatever Tim Cook has tried to create because of his distaste of innovators and lack of understanding it’s not a film and to business. Ti A further add on Tim Cook watch this try and understand what is going on here the need for new innovative products made outside of China! https://wwsg.com/speakers/patrick-mcgee/ Your email address will not be published.

REUTERS/Enea Lebrun HONG KONG, July 25 (Reuters) – CK Hutchison’s plan to sell most of its $22.8 billion ports business is unlikely to be finalized anytime soon, with political brinkmanship set to continue, and sources saying that a Sunday deadline for exclusive talks was likely to be extended. The Hong Kong conglomerate’s plan to sell the business, which would include two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal, to a consortium led by BlackRock and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run shipping company MSC, has become politicized amid an escalating China-U.S. trade war. Negotiations for the deal, which covers 43 ports in 23 countries, are on an exclusive basis between CK Hutchison, controlled by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, and the consortium for 145 days until Sunday, as per the terms announced in March. The deal talks, however, are unlikely to collapse if the two parties do not ink a pact by Sunday, with three people close to the ports-to-telecoms conglomerate saying the parties could extend the deadline to continue exclusive negotiations. The first part of the deal – definitive documentation to sell two port operations near the Panama Canal – was also not signed by an April 2 deadline set in the sales announcement. The people declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. BlackRock declined to comment. CK Hutchison and MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, which CK Hutchison said in May was the main investor in the consortium, did not respond to requests for comment. U.S. President Donald Trump hailed the deal as “reclaiming” the Panama Canal, after his administration previously called for the removal of what it said was Chinese ownership of the ports near the canal. But in April, China’s top market regulator said that it was paying close attention to CK Hutchison’s planned sale and that parties to the deal should not try to avoid an antitrust review. Beijing’s stance on the planned deal was made public after pro-China media launched a stinging criticism, saying China had significant national interests in the transaction and it would be a betrayal of the country. “I think at this moment it’s not very optimistic that they can directly sell the ports to the consortium,” said Jackson Chan, global fixed income senior manager at FSMOne Hong Kong, which has clients holding CK Hutchison bonds. “The market has already digested the news, even if it announces next week that it won’t sell anymore, I don’t think it’ll be a shock because the market understands it wouldn’t have a large impact on its operations.” CK Hutchison shares, which jumped 33% the following two days after the deal was announced in early March, erased all of the gains by mid-April. But since then it regained lost ground along with the rise in the broader Hong Kong market index. The outlook for the deal has been clouded further in recent days, with a separate source telling Reuters that Chinese ports operator China Cosco Shipping Corp (COSCO) was also looking to join the consortium to buy the ports business. COSCO is requesting veto rights or equivalent power in the entity that will take over 43 ports from CK Hutchison, Bloomberg News reported this week, citing people familiar with the matter. COSCO did not respond to a request for comment. The existing consortium would likely allow COSCO into the deal, said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research. “The bigger risk to the deal being consummated, in my opinion, is likely the Trump administration, which is likely to block a deal that would include China,” said the New Jersey-based analyst who tracks BlackRock. Ballingal Investment Advisors strategist David Blennerhassett, who publishes on the independent online research platform Smartkarma, said the addition of COSCO in the consortium was likely to enrage Trump. “Trump, who has a handful of issues already on his plate, would be incandescent,” he said.

Chris Morris is a contributing writer at Fortune, covering everything from general business news to the video game and theme park industries. It’s a good time to be a CEO. A new study by the AFL-CIO found the average corporate leader saw their compensation increase by $1.24 million last year. On average, the federation of unions says, CEOs at the nation’s largest companies made 285 times what the average worker did. A year ago, that ratio was 268:1. “The median employee would have had to start working in 1740 to earn what the average CEO received in 2024,” the organization wrote in its 2025 Executive Paywatch study. CEO pay at S&P 500 companies increased 7% in 2024 over the prior year, with the average S&P 500 leader earning $18.9 million, the highest amount on record. (The previous high was set in 2021, coming in at $18.3 million.) In the past decade, CEOs in the S&P 500 have seen their salaries go up by an average of $6.5 million. Workers last year saw an average 3% raise, the organization says. Among S&P 500 companies, the largest disparity between CEO and median worker pay was at Starbucks. While the average worker took home $14,674, according to the study, CEO Brian Niccol received $97.8 million in total compensation. That works out to 6,666 times more than workers and comes as the coffee-shop employees seek to form a union. Axon Enterprise CEO Patrick Smith topped the pay list overall, though, with the CEO of the Taser manufacturer receiving compensation of $164.5 million in 2024 – a ratio of 801:1. The report highlighted the Trump tax cut package in its report, noting that the average CEO would receive a tax cut of nearly $490,000 due to the extension of Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Workers will see their tax bill go down an average of $765. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Written by Asif Ali You want more customers, and you’re ready to advertise your business. But how should you do it? There’s Google Ads. Instagram. Flyers. Billboards. TikTok. And dozens of other online and offline options. Some deliver better results than others: But that doesn’t mean they’ll work for you: You have to find the right channels for your business, not just the ones that are popular. At the agencies I’ve worked with, I’d often see small businesses like auto repair shops and restaurants boost ad returns by 50-200% — just by switching to better-fit channels. In this guide, I’ll help you pinpoint the winning channels for your business — the ones that can unlock real revenue potential. I’ll go through it step by step in three phases, covering: And I’ll show you exactly how I’d do it if I had a starting budget of $500. Note: Want a quick list of ad ideas? Grab this free sheet with 30 ways to promote your business. There are dozens of channels you can use to advertise your business. But unless you have a lot of time and budget, you can’t be everywhere. In this phase, we’ll find out which ones are actually worth testing for your business. I’ll use a local furniture store as a running example. But you can follow the same steps no matter what you sell. Let’s start with the step most people skip: If you’re short on time and want results fast, paid ads can absolutely work. But that doesn’t mean they’re the best move right now. Think of it like this: Ideally, you’d do both. Paid gets you quick wins, while organic builds trust and visibility in the long run. But when you’re working with limited time and budget, you’ll need to choose: (Check out our ultimate SEO tutorial to get started with organic marketing.) If you’re ready to move forward with ads, let’s lock in your #1 goal. You can’t run effective ad campaigns until you know what you want it to achieve. Your goal decides everything, from where you advertise to what your ad looks like. One goal = one outcome = one high-converting ad. Not “get more attention.” Not “build awareness.” We’re talking actual business outcomes, like: Can ads do more than one thing? Sure. But when you’re starting out, trying to get five outcomes with one campaign just spreads your budget thin and hurts your ROI. So pick one. Ask yourself: “When someone sees my ad, what’s the one action I want them to take?” Let’s say I run a local furniture store. I’m not trying to sell sofas online, I just want people to visit the showroom. That’s my goal, and everything in the ad should lead there. Make yours just as clear (and measurable). Pro tip: Use the SMART framework to help you choose the right goal. Before you spend a dollar, look at how your last 20-30 customers found you. Because chances are, your next customers will come from the same places. Here’s how to do it: You’re looking for repeat mentions, or anything that stands out. For example: If 12 out of 30 found you on Google? That’s a sign to use Google Ads. If multiple people say they found you on Instagram? That’s your sign to create ads on Instagram. If you don’t have the answers yet, start collecting data now. Ask every new lead: “How did you hear about us?” Track the next 30 manually. Write each one down in Google Sheets or Docs. Here’s what that might look like for my local furniture store: Note: If you’re a brand new business with zero customers, clearly you won’t have any data yet. You can still use advertising channels, but your market research and competitor analysis (see below) will become even more important. Your competitors are already advertising. Which means they’ve already spent time and money figuring out what works. So instead of guessing, reverse engineer them. Here’s how it might look for my local furniture store: One competitor sends weekly promo postcards. Another runs billboard ads on the freeway and has flyers at the nearby mall. That tells me they’re spending heavily on local print and outdoor ads (and likely getting results from it). I won’t copy them blindly. But I’ll take notes: Then I’ll go online. I’ll start by manually checking if my competitors are running ads on major platforms. Many ad platforms have public ad libraries you can search. Like Google’s Ad transparency, where I can see if my competitors are running ads on Google Search, Google Shopping, and YouTube: I can also look up their Instagram or Facebook ads in Meta’s Ad Library: TikTok, LinkedIn, and Pinterest have similar ad libraries. I’ll go to each one manually and check what they’re running. If I want to save time and go deeper, I’ll use a tool like Semrush’s Advertising Research. I simply plug in my competitor’s domain and instantly see: All the keywords they’re bidding on in Google Ads and how much they’re paying per click: The exact text they’re using in their ads: And what landing pages they’re using in their campaigns: To analyze competitors’ display and social ads, I’ll use the AdClarity App. It shows how much they’re spending and how visible those ads are: It also shows what kind of ad creatives they’re using: Both tools give me a sharper picture of what’s working in my niche. If I’m researching just one or two competitors, I’ll stick to manual checks. But if I’ve got five, seven, or more? I’ll use Semrush. It saves time, and it surfaces details I’d miss on my own. Once I’ve gathered everything, it’s time to look for overlap: Let’s say two of my top competitors are running Google Ads for “recliner sofa,” and both are pushing showroom visits in their CTAs. That’s a clue that these ads drive in-store visits that lead to sales. Or maybe I notice all three competitors are mailing out seasonal promo postcards. That’s not something I planned to do. But if everyone’s doing it, there’s probably a reason. This is how to use competitor data to narrow down which channels are actually worth testing. Pro tip: Use our free Google Ads competitor analysis tool if your rivals are using search ads. Before you finalize your three channels, sanity-check them. Just because a platform is popular doesn’t mean your audience is paying attention there. You need to use what you know about your ideal customer’s habits to spot the right fit for your business specifically. For instance, for my furniture store, let’s say I know that most of my buyers are homeowners in their 40s or 50s shopping for higher-ticket items. (Ideally, you’ll have internal data to help here, but tools like Semrush can help here with their demographics feature.) Based on that insight, they’re probably searching on Google, browsing Facebook, checking mailers, and listening to local radio. Not scrolling Snapchat or TikTok. So I’ll cross those off my list, and I’ll focus on the ones that match how they already consume info. To validate that, I’ll use Semrush’s Audience Intelligence app. The tool’s Online Habits report shows when my audience is most active and how likely they are to use each social network. Meanwhile, the Media Affinity report shows which offline sources (e.g., newspapers, radio, and magazines) they pay attention to. It also shows what kinds of online media they prefer: If I see strong signals around Google and local news (but nothing for Instagram or YouTube), I know which channels belong on my list. That way, I’m picking channels based on actual behavior, not assumptions. You’ve done the research. Now it’s time to lock in your top three channels. Pick channels that line up with your goal, your audience’s behavior, and what’s already working for others in your space. And make sure they fit your budget. For example, some competitors can afford to run full-page ads in The New Yorker, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Or they may run radio ads that can cost up to $1400 for a 30-second spot, depending on the state. That’s fine if you’ve got the budget and it’s where your target audience is reading or listening. But if not, skip it. Remember: in this guide, we’re working with a $500 test budget. For my furniture store, I’m going with: Write yours down. These are the first three channels you’ll test. Need help choosing your three ad channels? We put together a detailed prompt you can upload to Claude, Gemini, or ChatGPT. It’ll ask you a few questions, then suggest three ad channels that fit your business, goals, and budget. It’s not a replacement for manual research. But it can help you move faster, with a starting plan that actually makes sense. Download the prompt file and drop it into your LLM tool to get started. Note: This works best with reasoning models. In this phase, you’ll choose what to promote, craft your offer, build the ads, and launch your first campaign. Here’s what this process looks like at a glance: I’m working with a small $500 budget, and I’m treating this as a live test. The goal: get your ads live, see how people respond, and make sure everything runs the way it should. Before you build anything, learn how your three chosen channels actually work. You don’t need to master everything. But you do need to know: That’s how you avoid beginner mistakes to launch campaigns that achieve positive ROI. (And save you from wasting time and money.) Let me walk you through the three channels I picked. Google search ads appear when someone actively searches for something you sell. For example, I can bid on the keyword “buy recliner sofa queens.” This way, whenever someone searches this phrase, my ad might appear. Google search ads follow the pay-per-click (PPC) model. You only pay when someone clicks on your ad. These are great for local businesses. Why? Because they let you show up right when someone’s actively looking to buy. But to make them work, you need to know the basics, like: Further reading: How to Use Keyword Match Types in Google Ads In my example, I also chose Facebook for one of my channels. But Facebook and Instagram both use the same Meta ad platform. So I can run one ad and show it on both platforms if I want. Instead of targeting keywords (like Google Ads), you can reach people based on: You can choose from image ads, videos, carousels, or Stories. Meta lets you set your own budget and charges you per result (like per click, impression, or DM). Before you run your ad, there are a few things you should understand to ensure good ROI: Postcard campaigns are straightforward. You create a physical card, choose the delivery area (like ZIP codes or neighborhoods), and send it to local homes through a provider like USPS Every Door Direct Mail or FedEx. But to get real results, you need to understand the fundamentals: This is one of the simplest ways to advertise your business locally if you’re trying to drive foot traffic fast. Some channels are simple. Like designing a flyer and dropping it off. Others take more time and practice to get right. Like running Meta ads or setting up Google Ads campaigns. You don’t need to master every feature. But you do need a handle on how your chosen channels actually work. That way, your campaign isn’t based on guessing. It’s grounded in real data. That’s why I’ve put together a free resource library with guides for all major channels. This will help you get up to speed with how each channel works. Download the free resource library with curated guides for popular ad channels. Don’t try to promote everything all at once. When you focus on one product or service, everything gets easier — from writing the ad to measuring results. Pick something simple, proven, and easy to sell. Ideally: For my furniture store, I might go with loft chairs. They’re popular and high-margin. And one of my competitors is promoting them in Google ads: You can test other products later. But for your first campaign, keep it focused. Even the best ad won’t work if there’s no reason to act. That’s what your offer does. It gives people a reason to click, call, or visit now — not “later.” Great offers are: For my furniture store, I’ll offer “25% off all loft chairs until Sunday, June 22, while stock lasts.” Like this competitor does: It’s clear. It’s specific. And it makes people move. A lot of small businesses don’t want to cut into their margins. That’s totally fair. There are plenty of other ways to make your offer feel urgent, without lowering your price. You could offer: Write down your offer clearly before you move on. This is what you’ll build your ad around. Every ad needs one clear next step. Click. Call. Visit. Book. Not all four. Just one. For my furniture store, I want people in my showroom. So across Google Ads, Facebook, and postcards, the action would be the same: to get directions to my store. One of my competitors does this with Google ads: Whatever action you choose, make it obvious. This is where it all comes together — your channel, your offer, and your CTA. Now you decide the ad format, write the copy, and choose (or design) the visuals. For my furniture store, I’m running three ads across three channels: Google Search, Facebook, and postcards. On Google, I’ll keep it tight. The ad will match what someone’s searching for. Like “recliner chairs near me.” The headline? Something like: “20% Off Loft Chairs – This Week Only.” The description line makes it actionable: “Visit our showroom in Queens. Free parking. Sale ends Sunday.” No fluff. Just keywords + urgency + next step. On Facebook, I’ll go visual. I’ll use a clean image of the actual loft chair in a styled room. The headline might match the offer (“20% Off Loft Chairs”) and the text could highlight one feature. Like “Reclines fully, fits small spaces.” The CTA button would be something like “Get Directions.” Like this: For postcards, I’ll design it around simplicity. Large product photo. Bold offer right up top. Short subtext that reinforces the benefit. And the bottom section will show store hours, our address, and a small map. No matter the channel, the roles of each part of your ad are the same: If anything’s vague, crowded, or trying to do too much, it gets ignored. So before you launch, ask yourself: If the answer isn’t yes within 3 seconds, it’s not ready yet. But if it is ready, it’s now time to work out how to get the most out of your ad budget. Not every advertising channel costs the same to get results. And not every channel works the same way. That’s why you don’t want to split your $500 evenly. Instead, think through each channel using three simple questions: Let’s walk through my setup. For my ads on three channels, here’s how I’d split the budget: Google Ads: $250 People are literally searching for what I sell. So the intent is high — and I want to show up. But clicks cost more here. $1.11 is the average cost per click for a keyword like “buy lounge chair.” Just to give you a sense of scale: If I spend $250 at $1.11 per click, I’ll get roughly 225 clicks. (This is an estimate. CPC is an average, not a fixed price per click.) And if just 5% of those people visit the showroom, that’s 11 visits. That’s why I’m putting the biggest share of my budget here. It costs more to show up, but the intent is also higher. And that makes it worth testing. Facebook Ads: $130-$150 I can reach local homeowners for less on Facebook than I can on Google Ads. These ads aren’t as targeted by intent, but they’re great for visuals and awareness. I’ll test a couple of versions to see what lands. Postcards: $100-$120 These have a flat cost with no bidding to worry about. I’ll send around 500 cards to homes near the store and track if anyone brings one in. This will cost me approximately $115 to print at FedEx. Will this split be perfect? No. But that’s not the point. You’re not trying to get every dollar “right.” You’re testing to see which channel shows real promise. Then you can double down in the next round with more data, more confidence, and better returns. You’ve built the ads. You’ve set your budget. Now it’s time to launch. And when you do, launch everything at once. Here’s why: If your Google ads go live on Monday, your Facebook ads on Wednesday, and postcards land the week after, that’s three different tests. You won’t know what’s working and what’s just a matter of timing. Launching all campaigns within the same 1-2 day window gives you a clean read. Same market. Same conditions. Real signals. That means: And once they’re live, don’t touch anything. No tweaking. No pausing. No panic edits. You’ll optimize later. In the next phase, you’ll learn how to track the results and double down on what’s working. Note: Setting up and launching your first ad campaign takes time. It has a steep learning curve and can feel overwhelming. Here are a few things that’ll make it easier: Your ads are live. The budget’s spent. This phase is simple: Check your results, keep what worked, and fix or cut what didn’t. Over the next few steps, you’ll learn how to track, compare, improve, and reallocate budget across your three channels. This will help ensure your next ad campaign achieves better ROI (and avoid you wasting money). Don’t try to measure everything. Just focus on the one action you wanted each ad to drive. For my furniture store, here’s what I’m tracking: Log your results in a simple spreadsheet, and check once a day for 14 days. Two weeks should give your ads enough time to generate meaningful data for this small $500 budget. Here’s how my spreadsheet might look: Ad platforms generally provide detailed campaign reports that show metrics like clicks, impressions, cost, and more. Like Google Ads: And Facebook: If you’re running offline ads, they’re harder to measure. But here’s what I’ve seen work: You don’t need a fancy tool — just a clear record of what happened. Because you’ll need that data to figure out what paid off, and what didn’t. We’ll get into that next. You’ve seen what happened. Now it’s time to make sense of it. Ask this question: Was this ad worth my money? Let’s say, for my furniture store: Let’s say 10 of those visits turned into customers, and each sale averaged $350. That’s around $3,500 in revenue from a $500 budget. If I have a 30% profit margin, that’s $1,050 in profit. This isn’t deep analytics. It’s a simple check to understand your ROI. Later, as you test more channels and scale up your spend, you’ll want better tracking systems. But for your first campaign, this level of insight is enough. Next, we’ll figure out why certain channels didn’t perform and what to do about them. Some ads hit. Some didn’t. That’s normal. The important part is knowing why. Because a low-performing channel doesn’t always mean it was the wrong channel. It might just mean the message was off. Or the audience was too broad. Or the offer didn’t land. In my experience working with clients, there are four main reasons an ad doesn’t perform: Go back to your underperforming ads and assess them against these factors. Write down where the breakdown likely happened. And don’t just look at what failed: do the same for what worked. For my Google Search ads, here’s what likely helped: For my postcards campaign, here’s what may have held it back: Don’t guess. Use your campaign data to spot friction and fix it before the next round. Your sprint 1 campaign is done. Now it’s time to level up. You’ve seen what worked. You’ve seen what didn’t. Here’s what you’ll typically do in the second sprint: In my case, for my next cycle, I’ll: And I’m going to increase my budget to $1,000. Because now I know what works, I’m comfortable putting in more. Eventually, as every subsequent sprint improves based on data, we’ll optimize our ads even further. And with that, our ROI will go up.

Title: BlackRock’s $10B Ethereum ETF Surge Propels Snorter Token to New Heights

Time Published: 2025-07-25T12:49:34Z
Full Content:
BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) just hit a whopping $10B in assets in only 251 days, making it the third-fastest ETF to hit that milestone. Such a surge signals massive institutional interest in Ethereum, fueled by price gains, US regulatory clarity, and growing stablecoin adoption. It also drives fresh demand for all projects building on the Ethereum network, including high-utility ERC-20 tokens like Snorter Token ($SNORT). The rise in BlackRock’s ETHA is happening in tandem with a dramatic rally in $ETH’s price. Just days ago, it hit $3.7K, a price not reached since January 2025. It’s now valued at just over $3.6K, up by nearly double compared to just last month. While the relationship between ETF inflows and $ETH’s price movement is complex, Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas says that ‘They feed off each other, but it’s not one for one. It’s a chicken or egg question.’ And Ethereum ETFs are taking off. Between July 7 and July 24, 2025, US-listed Ethereum ETFs saw a total of $9.9B in net inflows, according to Farside Investors. The surge was driven by strong demand for low-fee offerings from BlackRock and Fidelity, which generated $8.9B and $2.3B, respectively. The broader environment is also boosting interest in $ETH, with the passing of the stablecoin bill (GENIUS Act) significantly boosting Web3’s overall outlook. Ethereum stands to benefit the most. This is because it dominates all other networks when it comes to stablecoin activity, and with a whopping $80.958B total value locked (TVL), it holds 59.65% of the total market share. It’s supported by a massive $131.42B stablecoin market cap and $USDT (an Ethereum-based stablecoin pegged to the US dollar), which makes up 50.96% of the market. In comparison, Solana – the second-largest – has $9.739B in TVL, highlighting that no other network come close to Ethereum’s usage, engagement, and financial throughput. As institutional capital flows into $ETH and Ethereum continues to lead in TVL, stablecoin dominance, and on-chain activity, the demand for tools that simplify and speed up on-chain trading is bound to explode. This is precisely the moment that $SNORT’s Telegram trading assistant – Snorter Bot – was built for. Imagine being able to trade, snipe, and manage $ETH among other tokens directly on the world’s fourth-largest messaging app with no browser or extensions needed. Well, that’s precisely what Snorter Bot promises to deliver in Q3 2025. Once live, you’ll be able to buy and sell tokens instantly, set stop-losses, track portfolio performance, and mirror trades in one user-friendly interface. Built for speed and cost-efficiency, it aims to outperform competitors with the fastest execution on Solana and ultra-low fees of just 0.85% for token holders. This percentage is significantly lower than bots like Maestro, BonkBot, and Trojan, which typically charge 1% or more. Initially, it’ll launch on Solana, with integration on Ethereum and BNB Chain already in the final stages of development. Then, it’ll expand to other EVM-compatible chains – including Polygon and Base – as part of its ongoing, ambitious roadmap. And it will all be achieved while maintaining top-tier security. Snorter Bot is being built with a private RPC infrastructure, MEV protection, and scam-detection tools, including honeypot and rug pull filters. Such security protocols have never been more critical. Rug pulls alone made up 68% of all crypto-related scams in Q1 2025. $SNORT is the gateway to maximizing the ecosystem’s benefits. It removes sniping limits, offers access to advanced analytics and tools, and will grant voting rights in its upcoming DAO. It’s staking friendly, too. After buying the coin, you can stake it at a sizable 173% APY. The sooner you do so, the more you’ll earn, as this rate will drop as more users enter the pool. It’s no wonder that $SNORT has already surpassed $2.3M on presale, backed by major whale investors who have contributed $40K, $10.8K, and $10K. BlackRock’s $10B Ethereum ETF shows just how strong institutional interest in Ethereum has become. As $ETH continues to skyrocket and Ethereum network activity surges, the desire for fast and secure trading tools is rising just as quickly. This is precisely where Snorter Bot comes into its own. Not only will it track $ETH’s future trajectory in real-time, but also other major coins. By doing so, it’ll give you a leg up in the trading arena while the market continues to boom.

As Trump’s bumbling threats continue to alienate the US in Latin America, China is increasingly determined to hold its ground in the US’ so-called “backyard”. Just over a week ago, the embassies of the world’s two apex economic superpowers, the US and China, clashed in Mexico. The spark was a speech given by US Ambassador (and former CIA agent and Green Beret) Ronald Johnson at a gathering of a gala dinner of the American Society of Mexico (AMSOC) sponsored by the billionaire tycoon Ricardo Salinas Pliego, who is seeking to position himself as a populist Milei-type figure in Mexican politics. In what can only be described as a severe case of projection, Johnson accused “countries like China of trying to impose their financial control and greater economic and supply chain dependence on some places in our own Western Hemisphere”. The words represented the latest escalation in the battle for economic power and influence in Latin America between the US and China. It is a battle that the US is handily losing, as we have reported for the past four years and as even the FT conceded last year. China is already South America’s largest trade partner. As Reuters reported in 2022, if you take Mexico’s huge trade partnership with the US out of the equation, which Trump seems determined to torpedo, China has already overtaken the US as Latin America’s largest trade partner. Even a fanatically US-aligned government like Milei’s is strengthening its ties with China, much to Washington’s chagrin, while the Petro government of traditional US vassal state Colombia has joined the BRICS bank and is talking about cancelling its NATO global partnership due to the military alliance’s support of Israel’s genocide in Gaza. Colombia’s🇨🇴 President Gustavo Petro says Colombia will LEAVE partnership with NATO over the Gaza genocide: ‘How can we stand with armies that drop bombs on children? Those armies are not armies of freedom, those are armies of darkness. We have to leave, there’s no other way.’ pic.twitter.com/yZyTX1G0un — Going Underground (@GUnderground_TV) July 17, 2025 As is becoming increasingly clear, China is determined to hold its ground in the US’ so-called “backyard”. As the American Quarterly notes, the recent China-CELAC (Community of Latin American and Caribbean States) summit underscored the striking contrast between the two countries’ approaches: Xi Jinping appears to be aligning more closely than ever with the region as the Trump administration pushes an agenda focused on migration, tariffs, and even expansionist ambitions… By announcing a $9 billion yuan-denominated credit line and fresh infrastructure investment for the region, Xi not only reasserted China’s role as a development financier but also positioned the yuan as an alternative to the dollar-dominated monetary logic—a strategy aligned with the country’s long-term efforts to internationalize its currency. “There are no winners in tariff wars or trade wars. Bullying or hegemonism only leads to self-isolation,” Xi said in his inaugural speech. In September last year, Beijing urged the US to give up the antiquated Monroe Doctrine as Washington intensified its meddling in Mexico, Venezuela and Honduras. The Chinese government also continues to block a corporate deal that would transfer ownership of more than 40 sea ports, including two crucial terminals on the Panama canal, to a Western BlackRock-led consortium, again much to the chagrin of Washington. Now, Mexico finds itself on the frontlines of this escalating tussle between the world’s two apex economic superpowers. In response to Ambassador Johnson’s remarks, the Chinese embassy in Mexico posted a tweet accusing the US of spreading “lies full of ideological prejudices and cold war thinking”: The “theory of China’s threat”, hysterically propagated by the United States, is nothing more than an excuse to maintain its own hegemony. From imposing arbitrary restrictions and erecting commercial barriers, to mistreating foreign immigrants and trafficking in illegal weapons, as well as inventing false positions to sanction financial institutions from other countries, a country like the United States is shamelessly killing the region of the Western Hemisphere. The United States seeks everywhere and in every way to set traps and attach labels to China, forgetting that it is [the US itself] that constitutes the true regional destabilizer, economic-commercial threat and saboteur of development. Justice lives in the hearts of the people, the United States’ defamation of China is destined to fail. It would be advisable for the Ambassador of the United States in Mexico to dedicate more energy to promoting friendship with the country in which he believes, instead of inventing things out of nothing and confusing white with black, to avoid a total loss of credibility. US Losing Credibility So far, the tweet has had almost half a million views. One point it raises that is undeniable is that the US is rapidly losing credibility in Mexico. With his unilateral aggressions against the country, Trump has already caused a dramatic a shift in public opinion… towards China. One recent Pew Research survey found that 45% of Mexicans consider China to be the largest economy in the world, up from 33% two years ago. Crucially, 45% of respondents said they want the relationship with China to be prioritised over that of the United States while 44% would prefer relations with the US to be prioritised. This places Mexico among the most polarised countries on the issue of US/China relations. Interestingly, Mexico was one of only five of the 24 (Western or Western-aligned) countries surveyed by Pew Research that wanted its government to prioritise relations with China, albeit by a wafer-thin margin. Perhaps most importantly, more than two-thirds of Mexican respondents (68%) considered the United States to be the greatest threat to the country, compared to 5% for China. That is well above the levels of distrust for the US registered among Indonesians (40 percent vs. 19 percent), South Africans (35 percent vs. 13 percent), Turks (30 percent vs. 2 percent), Brazilians (29 percent vs. 15 percent) and Argentines (24 percent vs. 13 percent). This last result is perhaps unsurprising given that members of the Trump administration have been debating to what extent, not whether, the US should “invade” Mexico, and have been issuing threats on a more or less constant basis. That this is intensifying anti-US sentiment in a country that has already suffered at least 10 military interventions from its northern neighbour in its 204 years of independence from Spain is hardly surprising. There is a clear shift in public opinion taking place in Mexico, and it is one that is likely to intensify as long as Trump continues to treat the country as his piñata. Here is a quick recap of some of the provocative threats and actions the Trump administration has launched against Mexico, the US’ largest trade partner, over the past eight months: As El País notes, one of the main reasons why Trump is constantly attacking the US’ North American trade partners, Mexico and Canada, is to gain leverage in the coming renegotiation of the USMCA. Sheinbaum’s position since Trump’s trade war began has been to preserve the USMCA; however, the neighbouring country to the North and main buyer of Mexican exports, advocates a “renegotiation” of the trade agreement. “President Trump is definitely going to renegotiate the USMCA, but that will be within a year. He wants to protect American jobs, he doesn’t want cars to be made in Canada or Mexico when they could be manufactured in Michigan and Ohio,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said this weekend in local media. The problem for Mexico is that a renegotiated USMCA deal is likely to be even more prejudicial than the current one, especially if Trump carries through on his threat to close down automotive plants in Mexico and Canada. Then there’s the simple fact that the US’ word means nada. Trump may end up signing a new deal only to violate it or renege on it days later. The constant threats of intervention will also no doubt continue, and may even be acted upon. China: A Realistic Alternative? In other words, the world’s largest trade partnership will almost certainly continue to sour as Mexico’s deeply asymmetrical relationship with its biggest trade partner becomes more and more abusive. An early example of blowback from Trump’s tariffs and remittance tax was a 10% fall in Coca Cola’s sales volumes in Mexico, one of its most important markets in the second quarter. As readers may recall, Coca Cola was the target of a consumer boycott in the early days of Trump 2.0. But does China represent an economic alternative? The current answer is: definitely not. Although trade between the two countries has ballooned in recent years, it is almost all going in one direction: from China to Mexico, and in many cases onwards to the US. In 2024, Mexico’s exports to China represented just 1.5% of its total exports while its imports from China represented just over 20% of the total. Contrast that with Mexico-US trade: Mexico’s exports to the US last year represented 83% of all its exports while its imports represented just over 40% of the total. Which begs the question: given the vast gulf between their respective trade volumes, why is the US even worried about Mexico-China relations? The answer is simple: it is the trend that matters. As Enrique Dussel, the director of the UNAM’s Center for China-Mexico Studies (Cechimex), explains to El País, Mexico’s trade with China increased from 1% of the total in 2000 to 11% China in 2022, while its trade with the US fell from 81% of the total to 62% in the same period, mainly due to the rise in Mexican imports of Chinese goods: This U.S. is Mexico’s first trade partner with a downward trend, China is the second with an upward trend. What is happening in Mexico is also happening in Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Chile: the productive apparatus is replacing imports that were historically American with Chinese ones. The products affected include electronics, auto parts, telecommunications and automotive. It is not a one-to-one correspondence, but there is a strong association of substitution through imports. Within this reality, the trilateral relationship between China, Mexico and the US is unique, as we noted in a post last September, just two months before Trump’s re-election: The US and Mexico share the world’s most frequently crossed border and after 30 years of NAFTA and USMCA, their economies are tightly coupled. China and Mexico are not just trade partners but direct competitors vying for the custom of the world’s largest consumer market, which is trying to wean itself off Chinese products. Mexico has so far emerged as the largest beneficiary of the US’ nearshoring strategy, but the more it exports to the US, the more it needs to import from China. And that is the last thing the US wants. Over the past year, the US has escalated its war of words against both China and Mexico over the illicit fentanyl trade that is killing tens of thousands of US citizens a year. But as AMLO [and now Sheinbaum have] repeatedly argued, the US government has spectacularly failed to address the root causes of drug addiction within its borders. Instead, some US lawmakers and pundits have proposed using military force on Mexico’s sovereign territory, with or without Mexico’s permission, to combat drug cartels. That was the situation before Trump’s arrival. The situation today is far worse. On the one hand, Trump 2.0 is intent on undoing many of the nearshoring processes Trump 1.0 unleashed by targeting China with tariffs. On the other hand, Mexico is arguably as dependent as ever on the US even though its trade with the US as a proportion of the total has fallen somewhat. Mexico sources around half its food from the US and more than 70% of its natural gas. Mexico’s sheer level of dependence on the US — no comparably sized economy in the world sends more than 80% of its exports to one destination — and the constant threats of military or financial intervention emanating Washington, Mexico suffers from a structural vulnerability that limits the sovereign capacity of the Mexican State to make long-term strategic decisions. The Mexican economist Mario Campa notes that one of the two main stumbling blocks preventing closer ties between Mexico and China is the huge — and growing — trade deficit between the two countries, which he claims could be somewhat rectified through trade negotiations. The other, of course, is Washington. Regardless of who occupies the White House, the US government and its myriad agencies will not look kindly upon Mexico further deepening its trade relations with China, or the BRICS as a whole. But what alternative will Mexico have? To stay trapped in an increasingly dysfunctional relationship with a country whose government keeps threatening to invade? While many of the relative benefits of USMCA are whittled away next year by Trump’s protectionist demands? The Sheinbaum government’s response so far has been to launch Plan Mexico, an ambitious national industrial policy whose main objective is to reposition Mexico as a global hub for advanced manufacturing, technological innovation, attracting foreign direct investment and relocating production chains, with an emphasis on key sectors such as automotive, electronics, aerospace, pharmaceuticals and information technologies. The question is: whose market(s) will it serve if the USMCA unravels? For geographic reasons and given the unparalleled size of its consumer market, the US makes the most sense. Even without a North American trade deal and with Trump’s tariffs, the US will struggle to find a cheaper, more reliable manufacturing hub literally on its doorstep. Meanwhile, China is at the core of the Asia-Pacific region, which has been the main engine of global economic growth so far in the twenty-first century. If it can, Mexico should expand its exposure to that region. One way of doing that will be by completing the Interoceanic Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (CIIT), which could help establish Mexico as a global logistics hub. This huge infrastructure project is scheduled to be fully operational in the first half of next year. Once completed, it will link up four key ports — Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, Dos Bocas, Tabasco, and Puerto Chiapas — via 1,200 kms of railway lines, integrating 10 industrial and development poles. CIIT is arguably Mexico’s most ambitious infrastructure project of this still rather young century and its timing could not be better, coming as the Panama Canal’s logistics remain at the mercy of the weather and climate. There is also the ongoing tussle between the US and China over who owns the company operating the two ports at each end of the canal, which recently escalated into a war of words between the US and Chinese embassies in Panama. As I noted in my article last week on Trump’s tomato tariffs, if there’s one thing that can push Mexico closer to the BRICS, and by extension China, it is Trump himself. Without his constant bullying, Mexico may not have agreed to participate in the recent BRICS summit, for the first time ever. Mexico and founding BRICS member Brazil, Latin America’s two largest economies, are now fast-tracking negotiations for an expanded trade agreement as both countries brace for hefty US tariffs, set to take effect on August 1. This would probably not have happened, at least not this quickly, if it weren’t for Trump’s accidental matchmaking. Also this week, a Department of Homeland Security official warned that Mexican drug cartels could soon deploy weaponised drones at the border. I maybe wrong but i think these people will be CIA assets to escalate the situation Mexico is not in a good place but I do not see them having much choice than to start re-orientating their market away from the US and more to China and the BRICS to balance out trade more. And the reason is simple. Trump. As he is going to be President for the next three and a half years Mexico has to think about what that will mean for Mexican – US relations between now and 2028. And the truth of the matter is that Trump will keep on coming back to Mexico again and again so long as he thinks that there is money and concessions on the table to be had. And on any single day Trump could wake up and decide to put 50% tariffs on Mexico unless they changed a law or maybe their constitution or freed some prisoner or maybe even halt construction of the CIIT as it being unfair to American commerce or something. If it has the ability to compete with the Panama Canal then absolutely he will target it. And maybe there will be some US strike in Mexico on a suspected Cartel house or something. It would be crazy reckless but as the Neocons are running his government right now, it may only be a matter of time. Tough times for Mexico ahead. Turn’s out that Trump and Co are fools after all. If there was any hope left that Trump was “crazy like a fox”, it’s long since gone. If Trump and Co had any brains, they should have realised that in a post-globalised world, the highly integrated economies of the three big North American economies Canada, USA, and Mexico are the future for any hope of a MAGA future. But as befits halfwits and semi educated morons, they miss the bigger picture and at the same time they alienate their closest neighbours and most strategic allies. Trump is a real estate developer way out of his depth whose ideas of “negotiation” owe more to thuggery than any geo strategic and economic insight. Do you know why soccer isn’t as popular as baseball in the United States? It’s because they always score own goals! It’s because you can’t put many commercial breaks in a continuous gameplay. “Mexico is not in a good place…” I’m not so so sure, the economy is booming, the MxPeso is soaring, and. at least in this town and state (Querétaro) there is an amazing level of confidence and optimism and calm. It is somewhat inexplicable to me, but there you have it: Mexicans are tough and this is not their first rodeo. Big difference between here and Canada, which is angry and defiant, but cowering. Maybe it is explained by Mexico’s level of industrialization: they actually make things here. Thanks, Don, you raise a key point. Mexico actually makes things, and Queretero is right at the beating heart of its ongoing transformation. Maybe, just maybe, Plan Mexico could work, especially if the country is able to continue diversifying its economy away from the US. Forging closer trade ties with Brazil should help in that regard.

Title: Ethereum ETFs soar past Bitcoin in new flows as institutional focus shifts

Ethereum's market cap representation in ETFs jumps to 5%, signaling its status as a prime investment. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are recording a remarkable surge in investor interest, consistently outperforming their Bitcoin counterparts throughout the past week. SoSo Value data shows that spot ETH ETFs attracted $231.23 million in new capital on July 24, edging past the $226.61 million net inflows recorded by spot Bitcoin ETFs. When the timeline is extended to the past six trading days, spot ETH ETFs have received nearly $2.4 billion in net inflows, almost triple the $827.6 million logged by Bitcoin ETFs in the same period. This trend reflects a broader shift in institutional investor sentiment, with attention moving increasingly toward Ethereum-based products. Speaking on the milestone, crypto analyst Bec said: “This is the first time in ETF history that Ethereum has consistently outperformed Bitcoin in daily inflows across multiple trading sessions. It’s clear ETH is officially regarded as a institutional grade asset.” The inflow momentum has propelled Ethereum ETF holdings to new record heights. In July 2025 alone, ETH ETFs have absorbed more than $4.4 billion in inflows, exceeding the total inflows from the entire previous 12-month period, which stood at $4.2 billion. As a result, the total amount of ETH held by ETFs has jumped by nearly 50% in just two months, rising from 3.5 million ETH on May 1 to 5.6 million ETH as of July 24, according to data from the Strategic ETH Reserve. Their holdings now represent roughly 5% of ETH’s market capitalization. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has played a critical role in this run. Since July 1, ETHA has added over 1 million ETH to its portfolio, growing its holdings to 2.8 million ETH, valued at approximately $10.22 billion. This rapid accumulation helped ETHA become the third-fastest ETF in history to hit $10 billion in assets under management. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the speed of ETHA’s growth, noting it went from $5 billion to $10 billion in just 10 days, which is “the ETF equivalent of a God candle.” Despite the funds’ strong performance, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan believes Ethereum is still underrepresented in ETF portfolios. According to Hougan, investors would need to allocate an additional $7–8 billion to bring ETH exposure in line with market weight, assuming Bitcoin ETF flows remain flat.

Title: BlackRock’s ETH ETF hits $10B milestone in record time! – Details

There was a spike in profit-taking, but ETH’s speculative froth was not dangerously elevated yet. BlackRock ETH ETF, ETHA, hit $10 billion, making it the third-fastest growing product to hit the milestone after two spot BTC ETFs. Will ETH push higher or cool off? U.S. spot Ethereum [ETH] ETFs (exchange-traded funds) have been on a tear recently. In particular, BlackRock’s ETH ETF, ETHA, saw massive inflows and hit $10 billion milestone in assets under management (AUM). This feat has even rivaled some traditional products, noted Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, adding that, “$ETHA just hit $10b in one year flat, the 3rd fastest ETF to hit that mark in history after two Bitcoin ETFs $IBIT & $FBTC.” Source: X BlackRock’s and Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETFs were the 1st and 2nd to hit the milestone, followed by ETHA. But ETHA’s inflows streak was unique in one aspect; it doubled from $5 billion AUM to $10 billion in the past two weeks of trading, a move Balchunas called a ‘God candle.’ The spot ETH ETF products have seen positive inflows for 11 weeks straight. On the 24th of July, they saw a daily net inflow of $231 million, setting the 15th consecutive day of net inflows. Source: Soso Value Notably, the renewed surge in daily net inflows from early July rallied ETH from $2.4K to $3.8K, posting a 45% monthly gain. But the rally, also backed by massive demand from ETH treasury firms, has attracted significant selling. In fact, mid-July saw ETH profit-taking hit $1.4 billion per day on average, mirroring the levels seen during past local peaks in 2024. Source: Glassnode At press time, ETH traded at $3.6K, down 6% from the recent high of $3.8K amid a sharp BTC drop to $115K. This could be a healthy retreat before taking a stab at $4K since the Open Interest was at record highs of $57 billion, underscoring high speculative interest and liquidation risk. Source: CryptoQuant Even so, the speculative market was still ‘neutral’ as there was no extreme retail FOMO on the Futures market, per CryptoQuant data. This further suggested that ETH could still have room for growth before topping out or hitting a local top. Even so, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen warned that ETH may need to cool off, citing the overbought condition of ETH’s daily RSI. “ETH Daily RSI rejected at around 88. I would not suggest using RSI to identify when larger trends are over, but it can be good for sometimes guessing when the market needs to cool off.” Source: X Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Intel shares slide on quarterly loss, foundry business exit risk

Business FILE PHOTO: A smartphone with a displayed Intel logo is placed on a computer motherboard in this illustration taken March 6, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/ File Photo Intel shares sank 8 per cent on Friday after the company warned of exiting chip manufacturing if it fails to secure a major customer, a potentially drastic move by the new CEO to cut spending and revive the struggling American icon. Lip-Bu Tan said on Thursday he would further shrink Intel's workforce, halt work on two plants in Europe and slow another in Ohio, binning his ousted predecessor's strategy that relied on building costly facilities to restore its manufacturing edge. The plan for such extreme measures follows a surprise second-quarter adjusted loss and a forecast for a bigger-than-expected loss in the third quarter. The weakening financials pointed to more trouble for Intel after years of mismanagement eroded its PC and datacenter market share and left it with almost no presence in the AI market.

CK Hutchison's $22.8 billion ports business sale to a BlackRock-led consortium faces delays amid political tensions and regulatory scrutiny. The deal, encompassing 43 ports including those near the Panama Canal, is complicated by China-U.S. trade war dynamics and potential antitrust concerns. While the exclusive negotiation deadline may extend, the addition of COSCO to the consortium could further inflame U.S. opposition.

Title: ‘The Daily Show’s Future, Cable Networks’ Fate, And 6 More Questions Facing Paramount & Skydance Post-Merger

By Dade Hayes Business Editor After a long, complicated slog toward Thursday’s FCC approval, Paramount Global and Skydance Media will now face a number of tricky questions in becoming one company. While the $8 billion-plus transaction will need a few more days to become official, several strategic dilemmas already have been percolating. Here are the biggest questions the new leadership will have to answer: Staffers at Paramount already have been staggered by multiple rounds of layoffs, which saw 15% of U.S. employees trimmed in the final months of 2024 and another 3.5% let go last month. Those reductions, though, were in pursuit of a stated goal to achieve $500 million in cost savings. Execs at Skydance and its financial backer RedBird Capital say they have identified about $2 billion in savings once the two companies come together. That kind of slim-down is likely to affect a large swath of the 18,600 global employees Paramount had at the end of 2024. Watch on Deadline RELATED: List Of Hollywood & Media Layoffs From Paramount To Warner Bros Discovery To CNN & More When other bidders were jockeying with Skydance, some of them – notably Sony Pictures in partnership with private equity giant Apollo Global – were viewed as worse options in terms of job preservation. Surely, a Sony-Apollo takeover could have threatened the future of Paramount Pictures and its storied Melrose lot, and the duplication on the studio side surely would have left thousands without jobs. And yet Skydance might still end up as less of the savior it was seen as initially, depending on the extent of the cuts. As it has lost tens of millions of households due to cord-cutting in recent years, Paramount’s linear cable business has become a growing concern for investors. Media industry peers like NBCUniversal, Warner Bros. Discovery and A+E Global Media are in various stages of separating or exploring strategic options for their linear holdings. Now that the Skydance deal is done, the cable portfolio — consisting of brands like BET, MTV, Nickelodeon and the Paramount Network — is likely to leave the fold in some fashion. Jeff Shell, CEO-in-waiting for the new entity, has been bullish on linear TV’s future thanks to demand for sports. Broadcast and streaming will serve as the two weighted ends of what Shell has called a “barbell” of revenue, separated by the skinny bar of cable networks. “For a lot of us, we thought broadcast would decline along with cable five years ago,” the exec told investors in July 2024. “That simply hasn’t happened.” RELATED: Jeff Shell Faces Scrutiny Over Past Conduct As Top Paramount Job Looms Prior to the proposed Skydance transaction, Paramount had explored selling BET (including its studio and streaming service) as well as Showtime. Former CEO Bob Bakish’s falling-out with Paramount controlling shareholder Shari Redstone, which led to his ouster in the spring of 2024, was caused in part by his rejection of a $3 billion offer for Showtime. The premium network wound up being merged with Paramount+ and lost much of its original value. Despite Shell’s optimism, Naveen Sarma, managing director at S&P Global Ratings, has warned that linear will continue to be an albatross for Paramount. “Maybe Skydance will have a strategy that addresses some of that, but over the next, call it, year or so, year and a half,” he said in December. “We’re going to see a company that’s going to go through a lot of upheaval because of the transaction.” “I’m not going anywhere, I think,” Jon Stewart said on Monday’s episode of The Daily Show after a particularly long rant about corporate capitulation to “Lord Farquaad.” However, given Paramount’s cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert (“purely a financial decision,” per CBS), Daily Show staffers clearly are concerned that the Comedy Central show could be next. The show is currently on a hot streak in terms of ratings and awards nominations, and perhaps more importantly, one would imagine that if such a plan was in the works, Chris McCarthy, one of the outgoing Co-CEOs of Paramount Global, would have made a similar move to his colleague George Cheeks and done it before the deal was approved by the FCC. RELATED: ‘The Daily Show’s Jon Stewart Torches Paramount Over Colbert Axing: “Go F*ck Yourself” It’s clear that late-night is in a bad place, but one thing going for The Daily Show is that other than a handful of animated shows (South Park, Andy Samberg’s Digman! and a new season of Beavis & Butt-head), Comedy Central doesn’t have a great deal of original programming to satisfy its parent company’s carriage agreements. “Comedy Central is kind of like Muzak at this point. I think we’re the only sort of life that exists on a current basis other than South Park,” Stewart added. The merger will bring Skydance Television into the Paramount Global fold, which already includes CBS Studios, MTV Entertainment Studios — which produces all Taylor Sheridan series and Emily in Paris — and BET Studios. Some consolidation is expected. Led by David Stapf, CBS Studios, which absorbed Paramount TV Studios in 2024, has a distinct broadcast focus as the main supplier of CBS. Paramount Global co-CEO Cheeks, President of CBS, who is expected to stay put in the post-merger Paramount, is believed to be high on both Stapf and CBS Entertainment President Amy Reisenbach, so CBS Studios is expected to carry on. RELATED: Paramount Using Taylor Sheridan, 101 Studios Relationship As Model For Success Says Co-CEO It is unclear how exactly the rest of the production units will shake out, but Skydance Television President Matt Thunell is poised for a leadership role at a combined TV banner that may carry the Paramount moniker. As for Sheridan, with Paramount Global co-CEO Chris McCarthy, who oversees MTV Entertainment Studios, set to depart, one of his top lieutenants, Keith Cox, who already works closely with the prolific creator, could become his point executive. A few key posts have been determined, with Netflix vet Cindy Holland coming in to oversee streaming and Skydance Chief Creative Officer Dana Strong in line to take over Paramount Pictures. Deadline is hearing of a couple more changes. Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group Co-President Josh Greenstein is rumored to be entering talks for a role in the new corporate hierarchy. Skydance couldn’t go into talks with Greenstein, who is a close associate of Skydance CEO David Ellison’s, until the merger was approved. Following the exit McCarthy, Nina L. Diaz, Chief Creative Officer and President of Content for Showtime/MTV Entertainment, is expected to exit also. Even more than South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who clinched a mega-deal with Paramount this week, the primary creative voice associated with Paramount Global is Sheridan. The Yellowstone creator has generated billions in value for the company, though observers both inside and out have wondered about the future of the relationship given the changing of the guard. RELATED: 2025 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming Sheridan has been accustomed to working with large budgets, which surely will go under the microscope, as is the case anytime new owners take over. When Discovery merged with WarnerMedia in 2022, JJ Abrams’ lavish $250 million, five-year deal immediately became a topic. The parties wound up agreeing to a shorter two-year deal in 2024. Any radical change in the Sheridan universe won’t come anytime soon, given that he has several years left on his current deal. But the producer would have plenty of options for a new home down the line, given the aggressive spending by Apple, Amazon and Netflix of late. One widely anticipated change would see Paramount+ move closer together in the organization with Pluto TV, its free, ad-supported sibling. Such a move would save considerable costs in many departments. Those kinds of larger shifts aren’t primarily what Holland is being brought in to do. Plus, Pluto doesn’t have original programming. Holland, who teamed with Ted Sarandos to launch Netflix’s original programming more than a decade ago, already has been working behind the scenes to put together a slate. Her main mission will be to give Paramount+ more of an identity. While it has grown to 79 million subscribers, the “news, sports and a mountain of entertainment” marketing handle has been a frustratingly apt description of its uneven assortment of fare. RELATED: ‘NCIS: Tony & Ziva’ Takes Comic-Con, Drops New Trailer Skydance CEO Ellison, who will take the helm of the combined company, has talked about investing in the technology behind P+, which has had a start-and-stop rollout of table-stakes features like auto-play trailers. As advertisers and viewers continue to flock to streaming, though, a rebooted tech stack alone won’t get the service where it needs to be. Could they? Yes. Will they? Likely not. A clause in the 11-year rights deal CBS signed with the NFL in 2021 could be triggered with the merger, allowing the league to renegotiate given the change in control of the company. Questions had swirled about that doomsday scenario in 2024, with Commissioner Roger Goodell’s ambiguous remarks on the matter seeming to add fuel to the speculation. RELATED: NFL 2025 Schedule: List Of All The Games, Dates & Times To Watch Live Just this month, though, in an interview with CNBC at Sun Valley, ID, where he was attending the Allen & Co. conference, Goodell struck a much more upbeat tone about the status quo. “We’ve had a long relationship with CBS, for decades,” Goodell said. “We also have a relationship outside of that with Skydance. So I don’t anticipate that [opting out is] something that we’ll see. We have a two-year period to make that decision. I don’t see that happening, but we have that option.” Peter White, Anthony D’Alessandro and Nellie Andreeva contributed to this report. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Comment Name Email Website Δ Watch Colbert back on The Daily Show or Comedy Central at least. Thanks to union rules about pay, network television is far more costly to produce than basic cable. Colbert can get his salary and cut the costs of his crew. Bad news. Wow. I don’t know what to think. But if true the guy at skydance is a friend of felon Trump, this is all bad. Just rebrand and fold everything into Paramount name. Streamline it. Paramount and CBS the network should be the only general entertainment brands. Sunset Pluto and Skydance names. Bring back the Showtime name but keep all the programming like Dexter for P+, bundle it with MTV Networks – VH1, BET, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon – and spin off and sell as husks of their former selves to air old movies and shows. Paramount doesn’t need Nickelodeon. It’s a tainted brand. Take all the Nickelodeon characters like Rugrats and Sponge Bob and just fold them into Paramount Kids. Other questions: * The fate of Showcase Cinemas and UCI in Brazil, which is being purchased by Skydance as part of National Amusements. * A possible merger of Paramount Animation and Skydance Animation (including the fate of Skydance Animation head of animation John Lasseter). * The fate of Star Trek as per recent rumors. * Tying in to the linear cable matter, will Nick’s warhorse Spongebob Squarepants stay on the air, as well as the fate of Nickelodeon’s series animation business altogether.

The company founded by Jeff Bezos is at the heart of the technological revolution, with artificial intelligence (AI) driving its transformation. And with this evolution comes the demand for new profiles and salary changes. According to information shared by Amazon with the U.S. government and reported by Business Insider, these are the salaries received by software engineers, data scientists, product managers, financial analysts, and artificial intelligence experts. Software engineers remain the backbone of Amazon’s technological operations, especially in key divisions such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon Data Services, and the Amazon Development Center US. The latest data shows the following base salary ranges: These figures correspond to foreign employees hired in the United States in the first quarter of 2025 and do not include variable compensation such as bonuses, stock options, or additional benefits. Data scientists play a key role in developing intelligent products, optimizing logistics processes, and personalizing user experiences. Their salaries reflect that importance: Although Amazon does not publicly list all salaries related to AI, positions such as Applied Scientist and Solutions Architect indicate the compensation levels the company offers: In addition to engineers and scientists, Amazon generously compensates professionals who lead and analyze tech projects: Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, stated clearly that AI will lead to layoffs, but also spark a wave of new hiring, especially in areas like robotics, data science, and machine learning. In a June 2025 memo, Jassy encouraged employees to “use and experiment with AI whenever possible”, which sparked controversy among workers—especially since, in some Amazon subsidiaries, AI usage is now a mandatory criterion for promotions, according to Business Insider. In the first quarter of 2025, Amazon hired approximately 11,300 foreign workers. Information from Business Insider Cancela en cualquier momento Acceso exclusivo a rankings y radiografías.

ETHA needed just 251 days to reach this threshold, less time than all but the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fundspot Bitcoin funds, which needed just 34 days and 53 days, respectively. The fund doubled in size over 10 days ending Wednesday, adding $5 billion in assets to become the shortest period ever for a fund to grow from that mark to $10 billion, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas told Decrypt. "That five to $10 billion move, most of that's the price, although the flows were really robust too," Balchunas said. "So it was a nice combination of both. But I don't think I've ever seen an ETF grow that quickly. "This is very weird stuff," he added. The inflow surge has been closely intertwined with a dramatic spike in the asset, which on Monday approached $3,850, its highest point since December. It is currently trading about 3.5% below that at $3,710, according to CoinGecko data. Analysts have attributed the increase, along with the rise of ETH treasuries, to growing interest in the funds, although Balchunas said the cause and effect was unclear. "Flows in the price are like tangoing," he said. "I don't think the flows make the price go up. I don't think the price makes the flows go up 100%. They feed off each other, but it's not one for one. It's a chicken or egg question." LOOK OUT: $ETHA just hit $10b in one year flat, the 3rd fastest ETF to hit that mark in history after (you guessed it) two bitcoin ETFs $IBIT & $FBTC. Amazingly it went from $5b to $10b in just 10 days (ETF asset equiv of a God candle). Is in Top 5 in flows 1M, 1W. Sister Hazel! pic.twitter.com/Jrrb15BdHV — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 24, 2025 After starting tepidly a year ago by the lofty standards of the spot Bitcoin funds that preceded it, Ethereum exchange-traded funds started to accelerate amid a friendlier environment for digital assets under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, including the recent passage of the GENIUS Act. The legislation is expected to benefit Ethereum, the dominant platform for stablecoin transactions. The nine U.S.-listed Ethereum ETFs generated more than $1.1 billion in inflows just over the first three days of this week alone, according to U.K. asset manager Farside Investors. Still, the funds' performance falls well short of the dramatic success of the 12 Bitcoin products that now hold more than $140 billion in AUM, led by IBIT, which now manages more than $70 billion in assets. Those funds have also benefited from the surge in crypto markets and contributed to it. In a text to Decrypt. ETF.com Senior Analyst Sumit Roy wrote that he was surprised at how long it took for ETF investors "to come around," particularly after Bitcoin funds' fast start. "That all changed over the past few weeks as the mania over stablecoins and Ethereum Treasury companies gave the asset a shot in the arm," he wrote. "We'll see if this is the catalyst that finally breaks Ethereum prices out of their trading range—it may or may not be," he added. "Regardless, it signals that the demand for Ethereum ETFs has finally arrived."

Litigation Attorneys Encourage Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in any of the above companies between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, July 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: Picks and Shovels for the Mining Boom

Time Published: 2025-07-24T21:55:28Z

By Adam Sharp PostedJuly 24, 2025 The past 10 years has been dominated by tech. The Magnificent 7 is up 2,278% over that period. That’s Google, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Tesla, Meta, Amazon, and Apple. It’s been an incredible run. But the tech bull will soon be put out to pasture. Valuations are stretched. Employees are already filthy rich off stock options, draining their motivation. Spending on AI hardware and talent is completely out of control. Meta reportedly offered a single AI researcher $1.25 billion for a four-year contract! Talk about unsustainable… Meanwhile, once great companies like Apple and Amazon have completely dropped the ball on AI and are losing their way. Real innovations are few and far between. In other words, the Mag 7 bull run doesn’t have much gas left in the tank. So what’s next? Below is a 100-year chart showing how commodities perform vs the S&P 500. When the blue line rises, it means stocks are outperforming commodities. When it falls, commodities outperform (for a full-size version of the chart, click here). Source: Longtermtrends As you can see, it’s a cycle that repeats. Stocks soar for a decade or two versus hard assets, then it reverses. Over the past ~15 years, stocks have dominated. But commodities take their turn too. And when they outperform, natural resource stocks soar. These periods tend to be inflationary, as shown on the chart periods shaded in pink. The classic example is the 1970s, when gold and silver miners rose around 2,200% and the S&P commodity index rose about 586%. From 2000 to 2008 was another lucrative period for hard asset investors. I believe we are entering another commodity bull cycle now. The dollar is falling, stocks are ridiculously expensive, and President Trump is finally addressing our country’s red-tape nightmare. And of course, the Federal Reserve will inevitably be forced to restart money printing operations within a few years. Since the beginning of this year, capital has begun rotating into the natural resource sector. Gold and silver have been the strongest performers, and we’ve been all over that. With Trump’s ambitious natural resource reforms coming into effect, this trend is set to expand and accelerate. Copper, uranium, lithium, nickel, palladium, platinum, oil, gas and more. The whole natural resource sector is about to open up, and we expect capital to flood in. President Trump has had some recent political stumbles. With all the subterfuge and spycraft going on, it’s hard to figure out exactly where the truth lies. But in one area in particular, POTUS has consistently hit the ball out of the park. Trump has been laser-focused on fixing America’s broken natural resource sector. As we pointed out in The Dirt on Gold Miners, it has taken an average of 29 years for a new mining project to go from discovery to production! It’s absurd. The President is using a combination of legislation, executive orders, and political appointments to dismantle the regulatory gulag which has crippled our natural resource sector. I shudder to think how bad it would have gotten had Kamala won. America would have become ever-more dependent on China and foreign nations for resources, as our own mineral wealth wasted away in the ground. So we can be thankful for that. The big question is: which companies stand to benefit most from this mining renaissance? Over the long run, it could end up being early-stage exploration companies. Small aspiring miners with great teams, access to capital, and rich mineral deposits. For long-term investors, it makes sense to allocate some funds to these types of stocks (and majors, as well). But even with Trump’s reforms, those projects will take years to get going. And picking the right companies can be difficult even for the sharpest analysts. The companies which stand to benefit immensely and immediately are what Jim Rickards calls MDPs (Mineral Discovery Prospectors). These MDPs sell the modern, high-tech equivalent of picks and shovels for mining. They offer exploration and drilling services, seismic surveys, resource management, and more. These companies use advanced equipment which is set to radically improve efficiency and hit-rates in the mining industry. As the American mineral boom speeds up, select companies stand to benefit greatly. Their success doesn’t depend on hitting a mineral jackpot. They get paid for their services regardless of whether the exploration sites they work on are ultimately fruitful. Of course, they do the best they can. But ultimately the quality of the resource isn’t up to them. And their bottom line doesn’t depend on it. It’s the closest thing to a true pick and shovel play that I’ve seen. And as demand for these services rises, so will the price these companies can charge. It’s a beautiful model for this current environment. Two of my favorite people, Jim Rickards and Aaron Gentzler, recently sat down to discuss Jim’s big thesis. And importantly, how best to profit from this shift. Jim and his team of top-notch analysts have uncovered three small companies set to benefit from the nascent mineral boom, starting right now. These MDP stocks are completely off Wall Street’s radar. They’re too small for major analysts to cover (for now). But the potential is there. These companies are well-positioned to benefit from the exploration boom, and quickly. Mr. Rickards says he’s never seen a setup quite like this one in his five decades of investing. It’s the type of opportunity that only comes along once in a long while. The last time we saw a situation like this, the gains that were possible are hard to believe. But they’re very real, as you can see for yourself. Watch Jim’s new Birthright: Phase II analysis HERE.

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase both represent high-quality banking investments with strong ... More fundamentals and attractive dividend profiles. As we move deeper into 2025, investors seeking exposure to the banking sector face an intriguing choice between two of America's largest financial institutions: Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). Both banks have demonstrated resilience through various economic cycles and offer compelling investment opportunities, yet each presents distinct advantages and considerations for portfolio allocation. This comprehensive analysis examines the fundamental strengths, financial metrics and growth prospects of both banking giants to help investors determine which stock may offer superior returns heading into Q3 2025. We'll explore their recent performance, valuation metrics, dividend profiles and the specific risks that could impact their trajectories in the coming quarters. Before diving into the comparative analysis, it's essential to understand the core business models and market positions of these two financial powerhouses. Both institutions operate as diversified banking conglomerates, yet they possess unique characteristics that differentiate their investment appeal and risk profiles in the current market environment. Bank of America is the second-largest bank in the United States by assets, serving millions of consumers and businesses worldwide. The institution has built its reputation on comprehensive retail banking services, wealth management through Merrill Lynch, and robust corporate and investment banking operations. With a market capitalization of $358.7 billion, BAC has positioned itself as a leader in digital banking innovation and consumer lending. The bank's strategic focus on operational efficiency and technology investments has yielded significant cost savings while enhancing customer experience. BAC's strong presence in high-growth markets and its emphasis on relationship banking have contributed to steady deposit growth and improved net interest margins, making it an attractive option for investors seeking exposure to traditional banking fundamentals. JPMorgan Chase reigns as America's largest bank by assets and market capitalization, boasting a commanding $814.9 billion market cap that reflects its dominant position in the financial services landscape. The institution operates across multiple segments, including consumer and community banking, corporate and investment banking, commercial banking and asset and wealth management, providing unparalleled diversification within the banking sector. JPM's reputation for prudent risk management and consistent profitability has made it a benchmark for banking excellence. The bank's substantial investment banking operations and trading revenues provide additional income streams beyond traditional lending. Its global reach and sophisticated technology platform enable it to capitalize on emerging market opportunities and maintain competitive advantages across all business lines. Both banking stocks have demonstrated positive momentum in 2025, reflecting broader market optimism about the financial sector’s prospects amid evolving economic conditions. As of July 24, 2025, Bank of America trades at $48.39, representing a modest daily gain of 0.52%, while JPMorgan commands a significantly higher share price of $296.55, down 0.71% for the session. The performance differential between these stocks reflects not only their respective market capitalizations but also investor sentiment regarding their future earnings potential. JPMorgan's higher absolute share price and larger market cap indicate greater institutional confidence in its ability to generate consistent returns. In contrast, Bank of America's more accessible price point has attracted both retail and institutional investors seeking value opportunities in the banking sector. From a valuation perspective, both banks present compelling opportunities, though with different risk-reward profiles. Bank of America currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 14.15, compared to JPMorgan's slightly higher P/E of 15.21. This modest premium for JPM reflects the market's recognition of its superior profitability and diversified revenue streams. Looking forward, the valuation gap narrows considerably, with BAC's forward P/E of 12.17 suggesting stronger expected earnings growth compared to JPM's forward P/E of 15.28. Bank of America's earnings per share of $3.41, compared to JPMorgan's $19.48, reflects the difference in share count and absolute profitability. However, the forward metrics indicate that BAC may offer more attractive earnings growth potential relative to its current valuation. The growth trajectories of both institutions reflect their strategic positioning and the market opportunities they face. Bank of America's focus on operational efficiency and digital transformation has positioned it well for sustained earnings growth, particularly as interest rate environments stabilize and credit conditions normalize. The bank's substantial consumer deposit base provides a stable funding source that could drive margin expansion. JPMorgan's growth potential stems from its diversified business model and global reach. The bank's investment banking and trading operations offer upside exposure to market volatility and deal activity, while its asset management division benefits from growing demand for wealth management services. JPM's superior scale and resources enable it to invest heavily in technology and expansion opportunities that smaller competitors cannot match, potentially driving long-term gains in market share. Dividend investors will find compelling opportunities in both stocks, though with different characteristics. Bank of America offers a forward dividend yield of 2.16% with a quarterly payment of $1.04 per share, while JPMorgan provides a 1.89% yield through its quarterly dividend of $5.60. BAC's higher yield compensates for its lower absolute dividend payment and appeals to income-focused investors. JPMorgan demonstrates superior dividend growth consistency with 15 years of consecutive increases compared to Bank of America's 11-year streak. The three-year compound annual growth rate of the dividend favors JPM at approximately 12% versus BAC's 7%, indicating a more substantial historical commitment to dividend growth. Both banks maintain healthy payout ratios of less than 30%, suggesting sustainable dividend policies with room for future increases. Both banking stocks face common industry headwinds that could impact their performance in the third quarter of 2025 and beyond. Interest rate uncertainty remains a primary concern, as changes in Federal Reserve policy could affect net interest margins and loan demand. Rising rates generally benefit banks through improved margins, but rapid increases could dampen economic activity and increase credit risks. Credit quality deterioration represents another significant risk, particularly as economic conditions evolve and consumer spending patterns shift. Both banks maintain substantial loan portfolios that could face increased defaults during economic downturns. Additionally, regulatory changes and compliance costs continue to pressure profitability across the banking sector. Bank-specific risks include Bank of America's significant exposure to the consumer lending and mortgage markets, which could face pressure from fluctuations in the housing market. JPMorgan's investment banking operations, while providing diversification benefits, also expose the bank to market volatility and fluctuations in deal flow, which could impact the consistency of quarterly earnings. Wall Street analysts maintain generally positive outlooks for both banking stocks, with both receiving "Buy" ratings from the consensus. Bank of America carries a price target of $50.03, representing potential upside of approximately 3.7% from current levels. This modest target suggests analysts view the stock as fairly valued with limited near-term appreciation potential. JPMorgan's analyst price target of $301.62 suggests a potential upside of approximately 1.8%, reflecting the market's recognition that the stock may be approaching fair value levels. The smaller upside potential for JPM compared to BAC suggests that analysts see greater value opportunity in Bank of America at current price levels, though both stocks receive favorable recommendations. The analyst consensus reflects confidence in both banks' fundamental strength and ability to navigate current market conditions. However, the price targets suggest that investors seeking maximum upside potential may find Bank of America more attractive. At the same time, those prioritizing stability and consistent performance may prefer JPMorgan's proven track record. Based on the comprehensive analysis of financial metrics, growth prospects and market positioning, Bank of America emerges as the more attractive investment opportunity for Q3 2025. The combination of attractive valuation metrics, a higher dividend yield, and superior forward earnings growth potential makes BAC a compelling investment for investors seeking both income and appreciation. Bank of America's forward P/E ratio of 12.17, compared to JPMorgan's 15.28, suggests a better value at current prices, while the higher dividend yield provides immediate income benefits. The bank's focus on operational efficiency and digital transformation positions it well for continued margin expansion and earnings growth as market conditions stabilize. However, investors with lower risk tolerance may still prefer JPMorgan's proven stability and diversified revenue streams. JPM's superior scale, longer dividend growth history and resilient business model make it an excellent choice for conservative investors prioritizing capital preservation and consistent income generation over maximum returns. Bottom Line Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase both represent high-quality banking investments with strong fundamentals and attractive dividend profiles. While JPMorgan offers superior scale and diversification benefits, Bank of America provides better value at current prices with higher dividend yield and more substantial forward earnings growth potential. For investors seeking maximum upside in Q3 2025, BAC's combination of attractive valuation, operational improvements and income generation makes it the preferred choice. However, JPM remains an excellent option for risk-averse investors prioritizing stability and consistent performance.

Bank of America's earnings per share of $3.41, compared to JPMorgan's $19.48, reflects the difference in share count and absolute profitability. However, the forward metrics indicate that BAC may offer more attractive earnings growth potential relative to its current valuation. The growth trajectories of both institutions reflect their strategic positioning and the market opportunities they face. Bank of America's focus on operational efficiency and digital transformation has positioned it well for sustained earnings growth, particularly as interest rate environments stabilize and credit conditions normalize. The bank's substantial consumer deposit base provides a stable funding source that could drive margin expansion. JPMorgan's growth potential stems from its diversified business model and global reach. The bank's investment banking and trading operations offer upside exposure to market volatility and deal activity, while its asset management division benefits from growing demand for wealth management services. JPM's superior scale and resources enable it to invest heavily in technology and expansion opportunities that smaller competitors cannot match, potentially driving long-term gains in market share. Dividend investors will find compelling opportunities in both stocks, though with different characteristics. Bank of America offers a forward dividend yield of 2.16% with a quarterly payment of $1.04 per share, while JPMorgan provides a 1.89% yield through its quarterly dividend of $5.60. BAC's higher yield compensates for its lower absolute dividend payment and appeals to income-focused investors. JPMorgan demonstrates superior dividend growth consistency with 15 years of consecutive increases compared to Bank of America's 11-year streak. The three-year compound annual growth rate of the dividend favors JPM at approximately 12% versus BAC's 7%, indicating a more substantial historical commitment to dividend growth. Both banks maintain healthy payout ratios of less than 30%, suggesting sustainable dividend policies with room for future increases. Both banking stocks face common industry headwinds that could impact their performance in the third quarter of 2025 and beyond. Interest rate uncertainty remains a primary concern, as changes in Federal Reserve policy could affect net interest margins and loan demand. Rising rates generally benefit banks through improved margins, but rapid increases could dampen economic activity and increase credit risks. Credit quality deterioration represents another significant risk, particularly as economic conditions evolve and consumer spending patterns shift. Both banks maintain substantial loan portfolios that could face increased defaults during economic downturns. Additionally, regulatory changes and compliance costs continue to pressure profitability across the banking sector. Bank-specific risks include Bank of America's significant exposure to the consumer lending and mortgage markets, which could face pressure from fluctuations in the housing market. JPMorgan's investment banking operations, while providing diversification benefits, also expose the bank to market volatility and fluctuations in deal flow, which could impact the consistency of quarterly earnings. Wall Street analysts maintain generally positive outlooks for both banking stocks, with both receiving "Buy" ratings from the consensus. Bank of America carries a price target of $50.03, representing potential upside of approximately 3.7% from current levels. This modest target suggests analysts view the stock as fairly valued with limited near-term appreciation potential. JPMorgan's analyst price target of $301.62 suggests a potential upside of approximately 1.8%, reflecting the market's recognition that the stock may be approaching fair value levels. The smaller upside potential for JPM compared to BAC suggests that analysts see greater value opportunity in Bank of America at current price levels, though both stocks receive favorable recommendations. The analyst consensus reflects confidence in both banks' fundamental strength and ability to navigate current market conditions. However, the price targets suggest that investors seeking maximum upside potential may find Bank of America more attractive. At the same time, those prioritizing stability and consistent performance may prefer JPMorgan's proven track record. Based on the comprehensive analysis of financial metrics, growth prospects and market positioning, Bank of America emerges as the more attractive investment opportunity for Q3 2025. The combination of attractive valuation metrics, a higher dividend yield, and superior forward earnings growth potential makes BAC a compelling investment for investors seeking both income and appreciation. Bank of America's forward P/E ratio of 12.17, compared to JPMorgan's 15.28, suggests a better value at current prices, while the higher dividend yield provides immediate income benefits. The bank's focus on operational efficiency and digital transformation positions it well for continued margin expansion and earnings growth as market conditions stabilize. However, investors with lower risk tolerance may still prefer JPMorgan's proven stability and diversified revenue streams. JPM's superior scale, longer dividend growth history and resilient business model make it an excellent choice for conservative investors prioritizing capital preservation and consistent income generation over maximum returns. Bottom Line Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase both represent high-quality banking investments with strong fundamentals and attractive dividend profiles. While JPMorgan offers superior scale and diversification benefits, Bank of America provides better value at current prices with higher dividend yield and more substantial forward earnings growth potential. For investors seeking maximum upside in Q3 2025, BAC's combination of attractive valuation, operational improvements and income generation makes it the preferred choice. However, JPM remains an excellent option for risk-averse investors prioritizing stability and consistent performance.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, has disclosed a portion of its investment portfolio, revealing an involvement in cryptocurrencies that extend beyond Bitcoin (BTC). The announcement comes as Tether reports record profits in 2024, which have been used to fund these strategic investments in more than 120 companies across multiple sectors. Tether has unveiled a glimpse into its expansive investment portfolio, marking a significant pivot in its capital allocation strategy beyond just Bitcoin. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Tether, Paolo Ardoino, confirmed in an X social media post that the stablecoin firm has invested in over 120 companies as part of its Tether Investment division. He added that this number is expected to grow in the coming months and years. Notably, Ardoino disclosed that these investments are funded exclusively through the company’s record profits from 2024, which total $13.7 billion. He emphasized that none of the funds were obtained from reserves backing Tether’s stablecoin. Interestingly, Tether’s profits, generated from yield on its holdings of over $130 billion in US Treasuries, are now being directed into transformative industries through some of the most prominent companies. Its venture arm has expanded its focus past Bitcoin, now investing in areas like Artificial Intelligence (AI), renewable energy, privacy infrastructure, tokenization, agriculture, and others. When asked by Crypto Tale how this diverse portfolio supports USDT’s position amid an increasingly stringent global regulatory environment, Ardoino underscored its strategic importance. On the question of USDT’s future in Europe under the continent’s new MiCA regulations, the Tether CEO stated that the stablecoin company would only consider re-entry once the regulatory landscape offers stronger protections for both consumers and stablecoin issuers. On its official website, Tether shared a partial list of some of the companies among the 120 it has invested in. These range from blockchain infrastructure platforms like Synonym and Holepunch, to AI-focused firms like Crystal Intelligence, and payment technology providers such as CityPay.io and Sorted Wallet. The presence of companies like Blackrock Neurotech and Adecoagro reflects a commitment to broader technological and environmental impact, reaching into neuroscience and agriculture, respectively. Tether’s investment narrative is framed not solely in financial terms but as a deliberate push toward catalyzing decentralization and empowering individuals. The stablecoin firm declared its capital as a “catalyst for change,” invested in projects that reduce reliance on centralized systems and promote global equity. This mission-driven approach is visible across its portfolio, which also includes companies involved in data sovereignty like Northern Data, cross-border financial solutions such as Quantoz and OrionX, and privacy-first communication platforms. Mansa, a DeFi fintech venture, and Oobit, a global crypto payment platform, have also joined Tether’s investment portfolio, marking another step toward the company’s push toward real-world crypto adoption. Both firms expressed appreciation for the support, aligning with Tether’s broader vision to integrate stablecoins into everyday payment systems.

Title: Did Bitcoin Turn Pretty? Why Summer 2025 Is For The Girls
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/beccabratcher/2025/07/24/did-bitcoin-turn-pretty-why-summer-2025-is-for-the-girls/

ByBecca Bratcher ByBecca Bratcher, Contributor. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JULY 16: (L-R) Gavin Casalegno, Lola Tung and Christopher Briney attend "The ... More Summer I Turned Pretty" Season Three Launch Party on July 16, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Valerie Terranova/Getty Images for Prime Video) Summer 2025 may go down in history as the season when Bitcoin stopped being the outsider and became the main character. What began as an experimental digital currency traded on obscure forums has, fifteen years later, matured into a global asset at the center of Washington policy, Wall Street portfolios, and mortgage approvals. This summer didn’t just mark Bitcoin’s hottest days. It marked its arrival. Between a record-breaking price surge, landmark legislation, and unprecedented mainstream financial integration, Bitcoin has moved past the era of ideological fringe to claim a front-row seat in global finance. Here are three reasons why Summer 2025 is a Bitcoin summer. On July 14, 2025, Bitcoin reached $123,091.61, its highest price ever recorded, capping off a nearly 30% surge since January. The milestone followed a wave of renewed institutional investment, with ETF inflows at record levels and retail interest returning amid growing policy clarity. The rally felt different this time. Less like the speculative manias of 2017 or 2021, and more like a reflection of Bitcoin’s position in the financial mainstream. ETF flows from providers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton have helped push Bitcoin into retirement accounts and brokerage portfolios. In previous cycles, price booms were often dismissed as driven by hype, memes, and momentum. But today, Bitcoin is being discussed not just in Telegram chats but in earnings calls, investment committees, and Capitol Hill hearings. For years, Bitcoin has carried a reputation, fair or not, as a cause embraced primarily by libertarians, tech bros, and more recently, the MAGA-aligned wing of the Republican party. However, that perception began to shift significantly this summer with the passage of the GENIUS Act, the first federal law to establish a clear framework for stablecoin regulation. Signed into law on July 18, 2025, the bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support and signals a broader institutional embrace of digital assets, including Bitcoin. While the GENIUS Act focuses on dollar-backed stablecoins, its impact reaches far beyond. By providing regulatory clarity and standards for digital asset issuers, custodians, and reserve management, the law creates an environment where Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can grow within the bounds of established financial norms. It also helps distance the space from its earlier associations with regulatory gray areas and political extremism. This shift is particularly significant for groups that have been historically underrepresented in the crypto world. Statistically, women are less likely to invest in digital assets and more likely to vote for candidates outside the Republican party. A regulatory framework that emphasizes transparency, compliance, and consumer protection makes the industry more accessible to broader demographics, including women who may have been wary of crypto’s Wild West past. The passage of the GENIUS Act marks a turning point. No longer defined by slogans or partisan divides, digital assets are moving into a phase of maturity. For Bitcoin, the law brings more than legal recognition. It brings the promise of new participants, new voices, and a more diverse future. From memes to mortgages, Bitcoin has entered the mainstream in ways that once seemed improbable. This summer, the Federal Housing Finance Agency officially issued guidance allowing cryptocurrency to count as a reserve asset when underwriting mortgages purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That means Bitcoin, under the right conditions, can now help homebuyers qualify for a loan backed by the U.S. government. The move is part of a broader normalization of Bitcoin in traditional finance. ETFs have opened new on-ramps for both retail and institutional investors, and more banks are exploring Bitcoin custody, payments integration, and even stablecoin issuance. Bitcoin is being discussed not just as a speculative asset, but also as a component of diversified portfolios, financial planning strategies, and corporate treasuries. Culturally, too, Bitcoin’s image is shifting. What was once the domain of libertarians and crypto-anarchists has expanded to include professional athletes, pension funds, and suburban homeowners. Even traditionally cautious sectors like healthcare and higher education have begun experimenting with Bitcoin adoption, either on their balance sheets or through philanthropic arms. The idea of Bitcoin as “fringe” no longer holds. It has outgrown its early identity crisis and settled into something both more complex and more accepted. It’s not about overthrowing the system anymore, it’s becoming part of it. This summer didn’t just bring beach days and blockbuster headlines, it brought a narrative shift. Bitcoin has had its moments before, but never quite like this. The convergence of policy clarity, market highs, and real-world utility suggests not just a seasonal high but a turning point in long-term adoption. There are still challenges ahead. Regulatory uncertainty remains for some aspects of crypto. Energy debates, custody risks, and international competition continue to swirl. But the foundation laid in Summer 2025 points to a future where Bitcoin isn’t just surviving, it’s thriving. In the end, it may not be the flashiest headlines that mark Bitcoin’s breakthrough, but the quieter signs of permanence. Mortgages. Laws. Retirement accounts. Public trust. These are the slow, steady victories that define maturity.

Title: When Politics and Finance Merge, Truth Surpasses Fiction
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/07/when-politics-and-finance-merge-truth-surpasses-fiction.html
Time Published: 2025-07-24T18:00:18Z
Full Content:
In 1601, Robert Devereux, the 2nd Earl of Essex, asked Shakespeare’s company, the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, to stage the play Richard II at the Globe Theatre. This was done in the wake of an attempted coup against Queen Elizabeth. The intent was to stir anti-monarchical sentiment by depicting the overthrow of a weak king. The rebellion, however, did not succeed, and Devereux was executed. House of Cards, the series starring Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright, is a brilliant depiction of power-hungry politicians at the helm of the White House and their maneuvers to stay in power. Borgen, the Danish series, is a masterpiece of political intrigue and the backstage machinations of decision-making. Political fiction is a powerful tool to evoke ideas—which is probably why it is often one of the first things to disappear when politicians begin to wield power beyond party politics. It’s difficult to imagine these series being produced today in China, Russia, or Turkey, for example. They show a side of politics that is too real—of course dramatized, but still a representation of the inner workings of politics that most people only glimpse through news coverage. Russia has Roman Bolyaev, who produced The Last Minister but left the country when the war in Ukraine started. Türkiye produced the series Valley of the Wolves, which, although it makes references to Turkish politics and corruption, does so by blaming a powerful mafia that infiltrated the state—rather than the state itself. Of course, that is not to say there are no Chinese, Russian, or Turkish political dramas—there might be—but to my knowledge, none depict the current political climate as a ruthless set of ambitious individuals willing to do almost anything to stay in power. Such portrayals would not reflect well on the current governments. Let’s propose a few loglines for future productions: An ex-KGB agent rises to power, promising to fight the mafia that has taken over the state, but ends up creating his own to maintain control. A Communist Party leader takes over a developing economy and pushes it to become the world’s largest, while he becomes its de facto king. An idealistic young politician rises to power and changes a country, but in the process, compromises the ideals he started with. I think these loglines would make for pretty good series that will never be made—at least not in the countries where they are set. The reason I believe they will not be made is not just because censorship exists in these countries and not in liberal democracies. Censorship exists everywhere, one way or another. The reason is that in these countries, politics—not party politics—matters far more than in Western liberal democracies. Governments hold more power than their liberal counterparts, and I believe this is because there is no true division of powers in these countries. I am not speaking about the theoretical division of power into three branches—the judiciary, the legislative, and the executive—which constitutions establish. This division, though ideal on paper, is difficult to maintain in reality, and most authoritarian regimes claim to uphold it. I am speaking about the division between political power and financial power. If we leave ideology aside (with perhaps a few exceptions), this is the main difference between governments today. When financial and political power are unified, the state’s reach becomes far more extensive. Trump knows this—or at least his team does—which is why he has been campaigning against Jerome Powell to try to remove him. The issue isn’t just that the Fed’s policies don’t align with his own—it’s about who controls financial power and economic policy. Varoufakis describes it like this: In the United States, there’s a war happening—not just a class war but also an intra-capitalist war between the cloud capital owners of Silicon Valley and Wall Street. Wall Street will never allow people like Zuckerberg, Musk, or Apple to steal their financial rents—they’d “nuke” them if necessary. That’s why there’s no app like WeChat in the West. It’s not because the West can’t develop a free payment system like WeChat, but because Wall Street wouldn’t allow it, and Wall Street controls the central bank. This isn’t the case in China. What Varoufakis is pointing out is that in the US, Europe, England, Canada, and the West in general, banking and financial power are separate from political power. In China, this is different. The central bank is government-controlled, not independent. The country’s largest banks are state-owned. The state directly invests in private projects. There are private banks and financiers, but they don’t control the system. In the US, the Federal Reserve resists political pressure, but its leadership seems to have been cognitively captured by the banking industry. In Europe and the UK, central banks operate independently of the government. The ECB, which rules over them, is, to all intents and purposes, an independent entity free from political control. The largest banks and investment funds (e.g., JPMorgan, BlackRock) are private. Financial power and financial policymaking are not in politicians’ hands. As Varoufakis continues: Smart people in Washington DC realize China has a fantastic advantage because of this merger of cloud capital and finance—what I call “cloud finance,” which can’t happen in the US due to the war between financial and cloud capital. China’s political economy allows seamless integration. “China’s political economy allows seamless integration” because politics and finance are already merged, unlike in the West. The mantra there is “laissez-faire,” which is very good—except when the one saying it holds the unique privilege of creating money out of nothing. And everyone wants that privilege. Then it can turn a bit sour. The conflict Varoufakis mentions isn’t new either. It could be argued that it was among the key motives behind most revolutions, including France’s Revolution in 1789: when a new wealthy class becomes conscious of its power, it seeks to reshape the established order. That’s why Silicon Valley aligns with the Trump administration and why Trump is trying to influence Fed policy. Silicon Valley wants its seat at the table, and Trump’s administration wants control—at least a degree of it—over finance. China’s real advantage over the US—and what others (like Russia, with more success than Turkey) try to imitate—is the merger of political and financial power. This gives the state unprecedented influence over its citizens, and when combined with technological advancements, it creates a Leviathan unlike anything we have seen before. That’s why series like House of Cards or Borgen—which offer an uncanny look at politics—won’t be made in countries where financial and political power have merged. In those places, politics matters too much, and the reality of it surpasses fiction. Politicians are addicts and nothing is more corrosive to the soul or more addictive than power. Sorry, I have to disagree, and as an explanation, offer this paraphrase; The real disadvantage the US has, when compared to China, is the fact that our government has been coopted, and rendered relatively powerless when faced with any choice that might conflict with the interests of our financial elites. The neutering of our government’s ability to regulate finance has been under constant attack since at least the publishing of the Powell memo in 1971; The memo was a call to arms for corporate America to use its economic power to push back against the left, with particular emphasis on the importance of gaining sway over the courts, the academy, and the media. In reality, over the last 5 decades, corporate America, and finance has been allowed much too much influence in ‘the West’, and that is our disadvantage. And China’s government has so far managed to avoid many of the problems we face as a nation because in China, corporations, and finance, of whatever flavor, have not been allowed to purchase control of the government. Very interesting thesis, Curro. So are we changing from a system in the USA where finance and cloud compete to control the state to one where cloud and finance merge into the state? I’m not sure the state has that much power in the USA after working for finance all these years. It seems to me that American politicians have played the role of salesman for finance for so long that they’re incapable of thinking or speaking for themselves. It’s undeniable, though, that the Chinese and Russian systems are working much better than what’s been installed in the EU and USA. Here’s the missing link; Powell memo info I think this article makes a pretty good case for an independent central bank. If power is centralized, and concentrated, it becomes easier to corrupt. The US, like Germany, has a strong and well distributed regional banks, which serve as local power nodes in the banking system. (Although in both countries the State level regional banks are under attack from monopolists). The Canadian banking system is much more concentrated with less than ten big players, but it is competitive and there are solid cultural factors which make the central bank amenable to political influence to the benefit of citizens. The prospect of China-level centralization of power over all aspects of society I find scary. Although the Chinese have been running their show this way for three thousand years…..mostly successfully. I admit the concept of banking as a public utility has great appeal. How to govern it is the 64 trillion dollar question. I think the exercise of power in all of the countries mentioned involves balancing competition among powerful factions. Putin and Xi both command the ship of their respective states, but I think it a mistake to think that either leader operates without answering to powerful groups. So too here in the US. My understanding of arguments presented in the Federalist Papers was the need for a system to maintain a balance among factions, largely regional in nature, to prevent any one interest from seizing control. The recipe for a successful oligarchy to prevent a monarchy. The US had some experience with a national bank early in its history. It was not universally loved, as many believed that too much financial power was concentrating in the hands of an elite few. An early case of the 1% fearing the formation of the 0.01%? China has modernized most recently, has a large population that was recently rural, and has not devoted much wealth to projecting power outside the country. They have a culture that emphasizes education and the lessons of Europe and US development to learn from. Their particular formula has raised the standard of living of hundreds of millions. Their future may be bright for years to come. But I do not think they have achieved the end of history. Yes, USians are very proud of their constitution’s ‘balance of powers’ amongst the executive, the legislature, and the courts. As readers of NC well know, they conveniently forgot the banks. ‘They’, the sacrosanct Founders. Yes, but banks didn’t have the power that they have now and the threat of national banks or finance taking political power would not be evident for some decades. The Founders were concerned with more obvious problems that had been evident for centuries. Maybe they should have since the problems with bankers having too much influence had been noted or seen before. Just a recognition that the founders saw challenges in their time to maintaining effective governance. What was enacted was a result of argument and compromise and done with the expectation that further work would be needed over time. There were also many arguments over the role of finance and the lessons of the failed first attempt of the articles of confederation. China has found an approach that has worked well so far given where they began. Whether they will adjust effectively as circumstances change is an open question. yeah, ahem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_creation per Prof Hudson, that right there is the problem,lol. allowing private banks to create money out of nothing. freedumb, and all. China will last longer than us because they kept money creation/destruction in-house. the story i told my boys when they were little, but big enough to ask about where money comes from: welp…you go into the bank, sit down in front of Thom(we all know Thom), present yer bidness plan, etc and he goes into the Inner Sanctum, and waves those documents in front of the stone idol of the Grasshopper God(a computer terminal)…if the Effigy makes the appropriate noises, you are Approved!…and money is soon created from nothing and deposited in your account. when/if you pay it all back, plus interest(of course), that money vanishes from the world. both of them…in their time, and to their credit…came back later, after ruminating…and said something to the effect of:”that sounds a whole lot like what the priest does in church with that cracker”. and i considered the lesson complete, both times. they are both Catholic…which i supported, throughout…but i was allowed my say on things, also throughout. so, likely by my unintended influence/honesty when pressed….neither of them are on board with literal Transubstantiation….Cracker becomes dead god’s flesh for reals. so i doubt that this method would work in more literal and serious christian familas. Indeed, anyone can create money as it is merely an IOU. And as Minsky said, the problem you have is getting it universally accepted. However, private banks are licensees/franchisees of the state with a permit to create money in the currency of the state and not merely in their own unique monetary denomination. So we have, in our western financialised capitalism, the private banks deciding where their credit advances are to be spent. Will that be for risky and difficult to assess productive activities that add to GDP or for asset purchases in the Ponzi marketplace of real estate, stocks and shares? Without any macroprudential regulations mandating where loans are to be made then gambling on assets is the easy short term win for loan managers compensated on loan book size. Structure determines behaviour. “per Prof Hudson, that right there is the problem, lol. allowing private banks to create money out of nothing.” From a different perspective, allowing a multiplicity of small, local banks to create money might just be a pragmatic solution to economic growth provided the type of money locally lent/created is not for asset speculation. China moved from basically one bank to more than 5000 in a short period of time. Thus, the decision of how much money was going to be created and for what purposes was not left to a handful (say 5) bureaucrats at the central bank but, instead, an army of loan officers at the thousands of small local banks. If every bank has 30 branches and each branch employees 35 loan officers, then an army of more than 5 million on the ground experts would decide which company would obtain what amount of money and for what purpose (see writings of Richard A. Werner). its my understanding that that’s pretty much what the New Deal banking regs did….but that no longer obtains, and the banks own the gooberment, now, anyways. and if you were able to gather enough capital and set up a bank, (ie:if They’d let you)…if you started doing populist stuff like making rational loans, the big Banks would soon be upon you, first setting their Regulators on ya, then gobbling you up outright. whole thing needs to burn to the ground…and lamp posts and even guillotines will hafta be used, ere these greedy bastids get the way of the world right. This gives the Marxist state unprecedented influence over its citizens control over the capitalists it permits to exist and whose drive to accumulate it puts to use in selected areas of the productive economy… There, fixed it for you. I think the most accurate portrayal of politics was Veep There ya go. Of course both Veep and House of Cards had British DNA. And Mafia might better describe what is going on in America right now than Putin whose nationalism seems genuine, even if he’s no boy scout. Personally I have my doubts about how serious a threat Silicon Valley is. That was a show too, on HBO. My vote is for “The Candidate” and “Parallax View” for realism and the basis for liberalism. Dollars are private money; yuan is a public money — that’s all there is to this. Can you explain further? There is a lot of confusion about this. The US Congress, which is the representative of the American people (the public), can not issue dollars, it can obtain them through taxation (and the like) or borrow from the private individuals (including foreign). The dollars are made by the private consortium that exists in itself and for itself and is independent from the Congress/President/public. Dollars are made when this consortium lends to outsiders and to itself (e.g., when the FED purchases paper from its member banks; this paper can be anything, including useless mortgage-backed securities). This consortium owns the right to issue dollars and can never go bankrupt in dollar terms — it can always ‘disappear’ bad debt and make new money. Musk and the like borrow money from the consortium (and other sources) like the US government and the rest of us and derives income from selling things (real like cars and not so much like carbon credits), while the Wall Street is part of the consortium and derives their income fully from money mechanics (i.e., interest on debt and probably just money creation disguised as financial engineering). Currently, FED pays interest on bank excess reserves, which is really pure money creation. The FED is not a central bank (as in public), it is the money consortium self-regulation body. The US does not have a central bank. Jerome Powell is the Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. From my understanding, China has a public central bank that issues yuan. The Chinese government direct the Central bank to fund the projects of interest and does not need to borrow yuan from private individuals (although it can). From what I understand, Jack Ma attempted to introduce private yuan creation and was shut down. The yuan system can not go bankrupt in yuan terms either. Currency mismanagement whether dollars or yuan will be manifested in low quality of life. The private dollar and the public yuan systems do not mix well and their properties have huge effects on the corresponding economies, whether good or bad. More on this: Public versus Private Sector Money Creation: Society Enhancing Monetary Reform Frank Dixon Fellow, World Academy of Art and Science; Sustainability and System Change Consultant, USA; Author, Global System Change series of books Abstract Nearly all money in the US, UK and many other countries is created by the private sector through lending. Private sector money creation provides many benefits, but also imposes large costs on society. It’s been a long while, but is Victoria describing the private vs public moneys? If you have time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx5Sc3vWefE Yes, although she needs to make a clearer distinction between the two. The US had public money during the New Deal. The last public bank that could issue money closed its doors under Eisenhower. The New Deal had the Pecora Commission, while the 2008 had nothing of the sort. Branco Milanovic recently argued that what is evolving in the U.S. is a new type of capitalism in which the traditional capitalist is being challenged by new households made up of both the labor rich as well as the capital-rich. He argues that this growing cohort is an elite that is resistant to shocks in both labor and capital markets and thus able to maintain their respective positions. They are highly skilled individuals who have attended the best schools and probably feel that they deserve their superior positions. He maintains that many conveniently forget the capital part of their income and focus solely on the labor part for which they studied hard and worked hard. He links three items–ownership of lots of capital, high level of education, and a highly paid job. Thus, instead of a class-based society of the old capitalism, we now have an elite-ruled society that seems to transcend the contradiction between capital and labor and this is the new type of elite in most advanced economies, that now sits at the very top. (His stats on this are amazing.) uhm, labor is what cooks that elite’s food, does his laundry, pilots his private jet, hooks up that IV and nurses him when he’s sick, maybe even guides the robot that’s doing the surgery on his body. And oh yeah, stands guard with automatic weapons outside his house and his place of business. That elite schmuck ain’t laboring. Your mum does the washing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS9Bc_GQBEs&list=RDPS9Bc_GQBEs&start_radio=1 ‘They are highly skilled individuals who have attended the best schools and probably feel that they deserve their superior positions.’ Wasn’t there a report a few months ago of how the top corporations in America are veering away from hiring these very sort as being far too high-maintenance and lazy? And that they get better hires from cow colleges? “It is an elite, resistant to macroeconomic shocks, composed of highly-skilled people who have attended the best schools and probably feel to have deserved their superior position.” https://branko2f7.substack.com/p/new-capitalism-in-america Milanovic also warns that the danger is that this new class in the US will attempt to cement its advantages and turn itself into a de facto hereditary aristocracy. In his Capitalism Alone he points out that both China and the US face this same problem of preventing the emergence of hereditary aristocracy. ‘An ex-KGB agent rises to power, promising to fight the mafia that has taken over the state, but ends up creating his own to maintain control.’ I have a better and more accurate narrative- ‘An ex-KGB agent rises to power, sees that his country is being destroyed by within and without and will soon collapse and break up so decides to play the only way that he can – the Chicago Way.’ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjOPLTTjnwc (44 secs) Perfect. And accurate. He didn’t mention all the US operatives assigned desks in various Russian ministries as “advisors”… “An ex-KGB agent rises to power, promising to fight the mafia that has taken over the state, but ends up creating his own to maintain control.” I realise we’re speaking in the abstract, but I don’t remember the prototype promising any such thing. IIRC the story was more like “the mafia that has taken over the state gets its man in the FSB to become their new figurehead, only for him to actually take over and make them play by new rules”. And I haven’t kept up with TV in ages so I may well have missed it but indeed I don’t think there was any show to this effect and it seems unlikely to appear soon. It did show up in fiction literature (Latynina, Pelevin, more obliquely Boris Strugatsky, surely others too), but that’s obviously much safer and less impactful now. I think we did have something like that Turkish show you describe, though. Corruption was and is a popular theme in our television (popular enough that even I would notice there’s a lot of it, I mean). It’s a staple of our numerous cop shows and some other genres too, but I believe it is shown as something that stops at least a little short of the top. Which in a sense is fair, as that is also true for most actual corruption, at least in Russia but probably elsehwere as well; it is a highly decentralised and multipolar world. The power to mint money is and should be the sole prerogative of the sovereign. If it isn’t he and the land he rules over is not sovereign, it is a colony. In the case of US a self – colonized as they haven’t ever known anything else. A Colony is a place where you can exploit the land and people to destruction and then move somewhere else for a new opportunity. I had this revelation (it is rather trivial I agree) when I read Count Potocki’s Saragossa Manuscript a couple of years ago as a new translation had been published. There was a passage there that the Catholic King abolished slavery in The Crown but made an exception for colonies. That’s the origin story of US. An Exception. Nota bene, Potocki had extensive ties to Russian Empire and was an official at the Imperial Court and an envoy to China but this fact is totally absent in Polish Wikipedia entry which I imagine is a recent modification. It can’t be found in the English Wikipedia either, although it does at least mention that he died in the Russian Empire. The Russian Wikipedia does mention his Russian connections and diplomatic employment, though. He was far from alone among prominent Poles who had high standing in Russia, only for this to be downplayed by other Poles later. So it goes. 2D thinking. Geography is strategy. China has more than 100 languages, ethnic minorities and cultures. Truth? What is that? Who observes it? Reification destroys analysis. Interesting that the author makes no mention of Zelensky, who actually was an actor/comedian playing the part of taking over the reins of power in Ukraine in a TV production to fight corruption etc. He then gets elected in real life by an electorate yearning for peace and an end to civil war and fighting Russia who somehow believe he genuinely is the TV character he played. Only once in power, Zelensk goes all in on corruptly enriching himself and his cronies, banning the Russian language and intensifying the civil war and leading to the utter destruction of Ukraine and its population, now either dead, maimed or having fled the country. Given the alternative between the charade of “independent” central banks (which are, by design, aristocratic institutions inimical to labour) and a return to the consolidated treasury answerable directly to my elected representatives, I’ll take the latter, thanks. I realize that this poses a new challenge — forcing our elected representatives to accept the mechanisms and consequences of democratic accountability. But I prefer that fight to the radical centrist neoliberal technocracy we’ve been enduring for far too long now … The US operates under a liberal political philosophy and neoliberal economic philosophy, and China does not. Our liberal ideology values individual rights of the select few over the well being of society as a whole. Government has the role of protecting the individual rights of the select few, which means that government also needs to greatly limit the individual rights of everyone else at the same time. And the neoliberal ideology values the economic well being of those select few over the economic well being of society as a whole. Government has the role of creating the rules for the neoliberal economic system to make this possible. Real political and economic power in the US, even though it resides in only about 0.01% of the US population, is still diffused to over 30,000 individuals, plus their surrogates. That adds up to a whole lot of potential disagreement and division, and that we have in abundance. China is not liberal or neoliberal and therefore is not burdened with the level of disagreement and division that the US has. China’s political system is much more centralized, and in those instances where centralized control and unity are important, they will outperform the US every time. Liberalism has its limits, as it is impossible for everyone to have the superior set of inalienable individual rights that the elite want for themselves. Neoliberal economics has pushed the limits of liberalism far beyond where they have ever been, where the economic well being of 0.01% of the world’s population transcends the overall well being of the remaining 99.99%.

Title: Nuro, Uber And Lucid Join Robotaxi Race. Will Luxury Be Key?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2025/07/24/nuro-uber-and-lucid-join-robotaxi-race--will-luxury-be-key/

ByBrad Templeton ByBrad Templeton, Senior Contributor. Lucid vehicle with Nuro driver added to it for testing Self-driving developer Nuro and Luxury EV maker Lucid have formed a partership with investment from Uber to build a new player in the Robotaxi contest. Each brings an important ingredient, and together they fill an interesting strategic niche--is it the right one? Nuro was formed by two top engineers I worked with in the earliest days of Waymo. Until recently, their goal has been to attack the more tractable pure delivery market with a custom delivery robot about half the size of traditional cars. They received a large investment and hoped to be a delivery service company with their robots. Those robots, which have no place for a human driver, are among the few vehicles to operate without human supervision on public streets in the USA, and indeed the world. They recently announced the plan to pivot towards licencing their self-driving design to partners who want to do robotaxi, delivery or other applications, rather than do it themselves. Uber, most people know, is top brand in selling rides as a service, except in Asia. They do it with semi-independent human drivers. After a failed effort to develop their own self-driving system, which was traded to Aurora for stock, they have recently been booking rides for Waymo and have announced partnerships with several companies developing robotaxis, including VW/MOIA/MobilEye, Momenta, Motional, May and to some degree with WeRide, Baidu, Volvo, AVRide and as noted, Aurora. In this case though, they are making multi-hundred-million dollar investmants in both Lucid and Nuro. Lucid will build the vehicles, integrating Nuro’s hardware design into the vehicles. Uber will own them and operate them and integrate them into the Uber app. Lucid is known as a high-end EV maker, though at modest volumes. Their stock saw major gains with this announcement. Lucid has a reputation for quality, and they are one of the very few to create a new car company in the USA recently, but as a luxury OEM, they are to some degree the odd one out in this trio. The partnership calls for the production of at least 20,000 cars over the next 6 years (Lucid currently makes about 10,000 per year but is growing.) Nuro’s role is fairly clear. They have the software stack and hardware design. The actual hardware components are largely off-the-shelf including the NVidia Thor processor, and cameras, radars and LIDARs from different suppliers. For now, the software stack is the key component of a robotaxi. While there are many other components, including hardware, vehicles, infrastructure, or the network of riders and app that Uber has, these are not trivial but they are not the rare rocket science ingredient. A software stack ready to deploy in public with sufficient safety takes a lot of work and time, working through a very long tail of problems. It’s not easy to duplicate--or so Nuro hopes. Since the robotaxi business is the business of selling rides, Uber’s market-leader position is also unique, though the actual components, like the app and the backend, have been built by many companies and aren’t that hard to recreate. Building vehicles to spec is a capability found all over the world, though doing it at scale for low cost is harder. Right now, vehicle hardware cost is not super important for robotaxi developers. Most of them have a literal laser focus on making their system work safely, and reducing cost in the future will be work but requires no breakthroughs. Only Tesla and some lower-funded startups have cared a lot about cost. Now that companies are scaling, the view on that will change. Right now Waymo uses expensive Jaguars, but they planned to switch to low-cost Zeekrs, a plan that may be scuttled by tariffs. They’re also working with more mid-priced Hyundai Ioniq 5s. Tesla plans a dedicated Cybercab which takes advantage of the fact that a robotaxi needs far less hardware than a consumer human driven car, they say they will make it for under $30,000. Making cars is Tesla’s strong suit. Baidu claims their 6th gen vehicle has a hardware cost of $28,000--the Chinese are the best a low-cost car manufacturing. Amazon’s Zoox is making a more expensive custom built vehicle because they believe they can differentiate from competitors with the features found only in the custom vehicle, but in time and at scale it should be possible to make it cheaper. Right now, there’s no robotaxi competition. Companies either are alone in their territory, or they are not in active commercial operation with full fleets, so they’re not taking business from one another. The question is, when does that change, and when it does, on what do they compete, and how important are price and luxury? When companies begin to compete, the cost of the hardware will start to matter, because depreciation becomes the largest single component of the cost of a robotaxi ride. I estimate from 20-30% of the cost-of-goods sold. There are many factors in which robotaxi services will compete but the largest will be things like cost, wait time, service area and luxury of ride. Waymo's plan was a vehicle based on the Zeekr RT, which starts around $40,000, if not for tariffs. At the start, a luxury ride make sense. Why skimp, when you’re trying to make it work and keep customers happy, not improve margins. It’s a bit strange, though, because Nuro is touting how their new design with the Lucid saved a lot of money by replacing a lot of processing with the new Nvidia Thor--just to spend it on the Gravity, which typically sells around $100,000. But later this decade they will compete, and margins will matter. It’s an open question if, when competing, offering luxury will be important or if price will matter most. Nuro’s deal with Lucid doesn’t require that all 20,000 cars ordered be the Gravity, so in future a lower cost vehicle could come, though Lucid doesn’t currently make one. Nuro also says that because the Gravity is an electric, mostly drive-by-wire vehicle, it already has a fair bit of the hardware and redundencies they want in a design, and this reduces some costs. Uber may place the Lucid in their UberSelect or UberBlack categories, which are pricier than regular UberX, but command higher fees. They are, based on most reports, a much smaller fraction of rides than UberX. Most Uber riders are price-conscious. The picture is blurry, but now we can see some plans that players for the competition that will come later in this decade: All of this is in flux and subject to change. Indeed, in spite of Nuro’s announcement of ordering 20,000 Lucid vehicles, there have been many declarations of large orders from other companies, including Waymo, that were just aspirations, and never came to pass.

Title: Amazon to shut down Shanghai AI research lab amid US-China tensions

Amazon is set to dissolve its Shanghai AI Research Institute, the company’s last overseas AI lab under AWS, citing a “strategic adjustment” between China and the US, according to a social media post by Wang Minjie, an applied scientist at the lab. Amazon confirmed staff reductions to Chinese media outlet Caixin, but did not directly confirm a full closure. Established in 2018 during China’s inaugural World Artificial Intelligence Conference, the lab focused on research in graph neural networks and contributed to open-source projects like the Deep Graph Library. The institute, led by NYU Shanghai professor Zhang Zheng, remained small and never officially disclosed its headcount. The closure comes as Amazon continues global layoffs amid earnings pressure, with AWS revenue growth slowing for three consecutive quarters. The move also follows similar pullbacks by US tech giants including IBM and Citigroup, which have recently downsized their China-based R&D operations, signaling a broader trend of reduced American tech investment in China amid geopolitical tensions.

T-Mobile's cellular Starlink service for phones is here. But rival AT&T isn’t staying quiet and reminding customers that its own satellite offering is on the horizon. On Wednesday, AT&T tried to grab some of the spotlight from the T-Satellite launch by revealing that it completed a native voice call using its radio spectrum through the company’s satellite partner, AST SpaceMobile, an emerging rival to SpaceX's cellular Starlink service. The voice call was routed through AST’s five BlueBird satellites in Earth’s orbit, “with a standard cell phone using AT&T spectrum and passing through the AT&T core network,” the carrier said. AT&T likely wanted to signal that its own satellite-to-phone technology is coming, with the goal of beating T-Satellite on features. Although T-Mobile has a head start, its satellite-to-phone service is currently limited to text messaging and sharing locations. SpaceX plans on adding voice and video call support, but the exact timeline remains unclear. Meanwhile, AST is developing its own rival service, which has attracted AT&T, Verizon, and European carrier Vodafone as partners while securing investment from Google. AT&T’s announcement underscores the growing competition in satellite-to-phone connectivity, which can beam signals to users in cellular dead zones. In February, the carrier demonstrated it was able to power a video call through AST’s satellites. The technology harnesses orbiting satellites to act as cell towers in Earth’s orbit. The problem is AST only has five BlueBird satellites in operation, whereas SpaceX currently has over 650 cellular Starlink satellites. That's enough for coverage across the globe, including in other markets such as Canada, Japan, and New Zealand. It’s also why AT&T (and Verizon) customers still need to wait. AST's five BlueBird satellites have only been able to offer two 15-minute windows of coverage per day, AT&T told us last year. But AST is aiming to dramatically increase its satellite constellation by launching more powerful, second-generation BlueBirds in the coming months. Its first prototype second-gen BlueBird is slated to launch next month through India’s space agency, according to a presentation slide posted on social media. AST’s goal is to kick off a commercial service for consumers early next year. “Our plan is for this service to be text, internet, data, and access to applications like video conferencing,” AST CEO Abel Avellan said in May. But reaching the goal will depend on whether AST can launch enough satellites in the intervening months while securing regulatory approval from the US Federal Communications Commission. If it can’t, then consumers can expect delays. Satellite industry analyst Tim Farrar also points out AT&T might be trying to lower the expectations for AST's service. The carrier has revised some of the language promoting the upcoming technology to say "one day it may also support video services. In contrast, weeks earlier, the site said the satellite service was being designed to offer a "full suite of connectivity: voice, data, text, and video services in remote, off-grid locations." In the meantime, T-Mobile has made its cellular Starlink service available to customers on rival carriers, including AT&T and Verizon, for $10 per month. T-Mobile even offered the satellite capability for free to AT&T and Verizon subscribers during the free beta period. But now, new customers will need to call or visit a T-Mobile store for access.

Title: Here's How Much Traders Expect Intel Stock to Move After Earnings Today

Full Content:
Intel (INTC) is scheduled to report earnings after the closing bell today, with traders anticipating a sizable move from the struggling chipmaker's stock. Options pricing suggests traders expect Intel's stock could move more than 7% from its recent level near $23 by the end Friday’s trading session. A move of that scale would lift shares above $24 at the upper end, their highest level since March, or drag them down to $21 at the lower end, about where they were a month ago. Intel's stock has registered an average post-earnings move of 11% over the past four quarters, falling in three of those instances. In April, shares fell 7% the day after earnings as the chipmaker issued a quarterly forecast below analysts’ expectations. Heading into Thursday's report, all 11 brokers covering Intel tracked by Visible Alpha have a neutral rating for the stock, with an average price target near $23. Analysts on average expect Intel’s quarterly revenue and profits to have declined year-over-year, with attention squarely on how new CEO Lip-Bu Tan will manage—or sell off—the chipmaker’s struggling foundry business. Tan is reportedly considering changing what manufacturing process the foundry business focuses on, a move that would cost the company hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars, but could help win major customers like Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL). Intel's stock had added about 13% in 2025 so far, but has still lost more than one-quarter of its value from this time last year.

Title: TikTok Will Be Banned in September If China Doesn’t Approve U.S. App Sale, Trump Official Warns

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Howard Lutnick, President Trump’s Commerce Secretary, said TikTok will go dark for the video app’s millions of American users unless China agrees by a Sept. 17 deadline to a deal that will give the U.S. owners majority control over the app. “We’ve made the decision. You can’t have Chinese control and have something on 100 million American phones,” Lutnick said Thursday on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street.” If China doesn’t approve the deal, “then TikTok is going to go dark.” “Basically, Americans will have control” of TikTok in the U.S., Lutnick said. “Americans will own the technology. Americans will control the algorithm. That’s something Donald Trump is willing to do.” Popular on Variety Under a U.S. law that went into effect Jan. 19, 2025, it is illegal for American companies to host or distribute TikTok in the country as long as it remains controlled by Chinese parent company ByteDance. The legislation passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, on fears that the popular video entertainment app’s ties to China‘s communist regime make it a national security risk. It was signed into law by President Biden. Trump last month issued his third executive order delaying enforcement of the law until Sept. 17 while members of his administration attempt to hammer out a deal to restructure TikTok U.S.’s ownership in a way that complies with the law — while also being an arrangement the Chinese government will approve. In an interview with Fox News that aired June 29, Trump claimed his administration has identified a group of “very, very wealthy people” who will buy TikTok in the U.S. “I think I’ll need, probably, China’s approval, and I think President Xi [Jinping] will probably do it,” he said in the interview. However, Trump did not reveal who the purported buyers are. Trump told host Maria Bartiromo he would say “in about two weeks” who the buyers are, but to this point there have been such announcements. Trump, in the final months of his first administration, tried unsuccessfully to ban TikTok unless its ownership was transferred to U.S. companies. But after the 2024 election Trump said “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” because “there are those who say” the app helped drive support for him among young voters. ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by global institutional investors including BlackRock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna, with 20% owned by its Chinese founders and 20% by employees including those in the United States. The U.S. divest-or-ban law prohibits distribution of any app in which companies or individuals located in a country that is a “foreign adversary” to the United States “directly or indirectly own” at least a 20% stake. At a congressional hearing in March 2023, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said, “ByteDance is not owned or controlled by the Chinese government” and said there is an “inaccurate belief that TikTok’s corporate structure makes it beholden to the Chinese government or that it shares information about U.S. users with the Chinese government. This is emphatically untrue.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Where to invest $10,000 right now, according to 6 Wall Street heavyweights

Time Published: 2025-07-24T15:23:22Z
Full Content:
If you have $10,000 in cash waiting to be invested, you probably wish you had shoveled that money into the stock market in mid-April. But you're not the first, and won't be the last, investor who missed a good entry point into the market. Even with the market at all-time highs since hitting a bottom in April, that doesn't mean it's a bad time to jump in. Six Wall Street veterans told Business Insider that there are still plenty of pockets of opportunity. Some, for example, still like tech stocks as AI investment booms. Some of those same people also think it's smart to hedge and diversify right now amid the hype and lofty valuations. They recommend allocating some money to areas like value or international stocks. There's no one-size-fits-all approach to investing. Figuring out where to put your money depends on your individual circumstances, like your investment timeline and risk tolerance. For this hypothetical thought exercise, we asked our sources where they themselves would invest the money if they suddenly came into $10,000. Santos said that if she were gifted $10,000 right now, she would invest $7,000 in developed-market ex-US stocks and the remaining $3,000 in emerging-market stocks. "After 15 years of disappointment, it's really been all about international equities this year — huge outperformance, and something we see as just the beginning," Santos said. Santos is still bullish on US stocks, but said that international stocks are primed for relative outperformance given how high valuations are on US stocks. Historically, US stocks have traded at a 15% premium to international stocks, but now trade at a 35% premium. Plus, the value of the US dollar has fallen in recent months, and demand for ex-US assets has risen. "For someone, maybe like me, who's been too concentrated just on the US equity story, I think we've really seen a huge turning point to put some of that money to work overseas finally," she said. Two examples of exchange-traded funds that offer exposure to these areas include the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (VEA) and the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM). Year-to-date, the funds are up 19.7% and 18.6%, respectively. Bannister identified three baskets of opportunities: value stocks, small-caps, and international stocks. For value stocks, he said to go with a large-cap value fund like the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV). For small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) works well for its broad-based nature having exposure to the growth and value factors, Bannister said. And for international stocks, Bannister like the iShares MSCI ACWI ex US ETF (ACWX). These trades provide diversification from a tech-concentrated market, Bannister said. "Right now the market's obsessively focused on tech. But it's hard to run an economy on seven stocks," Bannister said, referring to the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Bannister said he recently put long-term bets on these trades himself. "I actually put a third, a third, a third, into small-cap, international, and value on some money that came in in May that I got, and we'll see how it works out for 10 years," he said. Normally, Smith would simply recommend a broad market index so that your money is well diversified. There's only one problem with that: most main indexes aren't all that diversified at the moment, with the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks making up almost a third of the S&P 500. So Smith has an easy fix: Put 50-60% of the money into an equal-weight S&P 500 fund, like the Invesco S&P 500® Equal Weight ETF (RSP), rather than the more widely followed market cap-weighted index. The equal-weight product gives you the same exposure to all 500 companies in the index instead of adjusting for exposure by company size. The equal-weight index has generally underperformed over the last five years, but it would hypothetically suffer less downside in a tech sell-off. The remaining 40-50% of the money can go into a more concentrated cap-weighted index like the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, Smith said. That way, you don't miss out too much if the tech rally keeps ripping. "Now you get all your top tech holdings that are driving this market," he said. Smith's suggestions assume at least a five-year timeline. Unlike Santos, Kantrowitz is still bullish on the American exceptionalism theme and would continue to bet on the US stock market for the next few years. Kantrowitz doesn't have a specific sector slant — he recommends investing in large-cap profitable leaders within their industries. "The earnings backdrop is going to be very bifurcated, and interest rates are going to remain elevated," Kantrowitz said of the next few years. With this backdrop, existing large-cap winners will continue to perform and have better earnings revisions than their peers. Kantrowitz would avoid passive sector indexes like a broad tech ETF, as those often don't accurately reflect the performance of the underlying basket of stocks due to weighting criteria. Instead, he recommends a more active stock-picking approach. The largest names that are screening well in Piper Sandler's models include Big Tech names — unsurprisingly, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta make the list — and companies like Oracle, Costco, Johnson & Johnson, and Home Depot. DeSpirito, who manages several funds with a focus on combining value and quality, would split his investment between large-cap growth companies, dividend stocks, and value stocks. His guiding principle is building a well-diversified portfolio that can weather market volatility, given tariff headlines. The S&P 500 has undoubtedly become more expensive and growth-oriented thanks to the dominance of tech, but it's still a good idea to maintain exposure to Big Tech, according to DeSprito. "I'm not negative on the Mag Seven," DeSpirito said. "Many of them have really good growth and really good free cash flow. That's an incredibly powerful combination, and so they earn the multiples that they're trading at." For diversification, dividend stocks tend to be more resilient during downturns and provide a steady stream of income. DeSpirito is also on the hunt for unloved stocks that are trading cheaply. Healthcare companies are an especially compelling opportunity at the intersection of value and quality, according to DeSpirito. This area of the market has been largely ignored by investors, with the S&P 500 healthcare sector down 2% year-to-date. DeSpirito likes medical device companies, as these trade at mid-teens earnings ratios with good growth prospects. However, some large-cap pharmaceutical companies could be value traps, as their earnings are heavily dependent on patents, DeSpirito warned. For investors with a longer timeline and a higher risk tolerance, Castleton suggested a three-pronged approach in equities. First, plug around 60% of your funds into large-cap stocks with a bias toward tech. Despite its comeback rally after a sharp dip earlier this year, tech is "still one of the areas and sectors that's going to dominate the markets for the next 10 years" given the innovation coming out of the sector, Castleton said. There are multiple ways to get exposure to the tech theme, but some general example funds might include the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) and the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ). Second, put about 20% of the fund into ex-US stocks. International stocks have gotten a big boost this year amid Trump's trade war and initial pullback from US support in Ukraine, and Castleton thinks the rally can continue. "You have to have some of that diversification because I truly believe going forward that you'll continue to see value coming out of Europe, some of these ex-US players that are now all of a sudden shifting their mentality to spending more on defense, to deregulating their companies," she said. Third, Castleton said to put the remaining 20% into mid-cap stocks, or companies with a market cap between $2 and 10 billion. This can provide further portfolio diversification, Castleton said, but the stocks should also benefit from reshoring as the deglobalization trend continues. "They're more domestically-oriented companies, and they also have a lot more room to grow than the large caps that have already kind of established their business models," she said. Jump to

Two stocks purchased by investment legend Warren Buffett’s firm in the first quarter of the year have witnessed significant gains in 2025. Filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year indicate Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway bought 238,613 new shares of Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) in Q1, worth approximately $204 million. The Omaha-based holding company also bought 112,401 new shares of Heico Corporation (HEI), an aerospace and electronics firm. Those new shares were worth nearly $50 million in Q1. Domino’s stock is up more than 2.5% in the past five days, more than 4% in the past month and more than 13.5% year-to-date. Heico’s stock is up more than 35% in 2025. Berkshire Hathaway added shares in both firms while hawking $3.23 billion worth of stock in the financial giants Citigroup, Bank of America and Capital One in Q1. Buffett’s firm completely exited Citigroup in the first quarter, unloading its remaining 14,639,502 shares worth about $1 billion. Berkshire sold an additional 48.7 million Bank of America shares in Q1, worth about $2.19 billion, and 300,000 shares in Capital One exposure, worth more than $46 million. Buffett’s firm also sold all of its remaining 40,180,168 shares of the Brazilian fintech Nu Holdings, which were worth more than $416 million. Beyond banking, Berkshire also reduced positions in Charter Communications, DaVita, T-Mobile and Liberty Media’s Formula One stock.

Title: Tech industry layoffs hit 100,000 for 2025 — Intel leading the pack with over 12,000 personnel cut, so far

Thousands are being laid off due to industry shifts. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The tech industry has been reeling from a series of layoffs from big tech companies, and we’re just a few weeks into the second half of the year. According to numbers compiled by The Bridge Chronicle, more than 100,000 have been laid off so far, with Intel the leader, slashing over 12,000 positions across the globe. Microsoft follows closely, with 10,000 personnel laid off from several divisions, including cloud, gaming (including game studios), and hardware. Meta has also cut about 8,000 workers despite offering $100M bonuses for new AI hires and rapidly building AI data centers. Other big companies affected by layoffs include Amazon, Google, Salesforce, and Cisco. Intel had been expected to trim off several positions ever since its disastrous financial report in August 2024. Its new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, undertook a 20% workforce reduction in April, with its entire automotive chip division reportedly getting the axe in June. It has also reportedly reduced the number of fab workers at its Oregon site in the same month, and rumors point to more planned in the coming weeks. The other companies that laid off thousands of personnel are not suffering from poor financial performance, but changing priorities and technologies are forcing them to pivot. The biggest disruption so far is delivered by AI, with institutions turning towards automation to reduce their workforce. A few CEOs, including Anthropic’s Dario Amodei and Ford’s Jim Farley, are warning that artificial intelligence will decimate America’s white collar workforce, but Nvidia’s Jensen Huang says that it all depends on humanity’s creativity. The Bridge Chronicle also says that the massive remote work hiring made by tech companies during and immediately after the Global Pandemic, in anticipation of the massive growth pushed by quarantines, is coming back to bite them. When the world eventually opened up, these expected gains did not materialize, leading to a bloated workforce, with many redundancies in tasks and positions. Aside from that, global headwinds have also dampened the outlook of several companies. President Trump’s tariffs have resulted in shockwaves across different industries, with tech companies some of the most affected by the changes. There’s also Russia’s continuing invasion of Ukraine, as well as the China-US trade war. While tech giants continue to invest billions in artificial intelligence and data centers, spending both on infrastructure and people, they’re also cutting back on less profitable ventures, resulting in thousands of layoffs being reported across the industry.

Christiaan Hetzner is a former writer for Fortune, where he covered Europe’s changing business landscape. Tesla shares sold off overnight and Wednesday morning after CEO Elon Musk scrapped his full-year guidance, warned upcoming quarters could prove rough, and hosted an earnings call once again long on promises and short on specifics. The stock was down 9% this morning at the open. Just over a month ago, the company launched its maiden robotaxi fleet in Austin. The new flagship service crystallized over a decade of investment in artificial intelligence and is meant to be definitive proof the EV maker is now an AI and robotics company. Yet four weeks later, Tesla has little to show for it. Just 7,000 driverless miles have been logged, Musk’s team revealed in the quarterly call. That works out to 20 miles per car per day, on average. Shares held steady in after-hours trading following the release of widely expected weak Q2 results that included an 89% drop in net cash generated. But they dipped lower as the earnings call drew to a close with little in the way of answers. They were nearly 6% down as trading began in New York. “Investors were searching for something and not hearing it,” wrote Gene Munster, cofounder of Deepwater Asset Management and longtime Tesla bull, who counted himself among the disappointed. “I wanted to hear more details about how the master plan will advance in the near term.” The call was Musk’s first opportunity to present shareholders with a clear road map for his robotaxi service with concrete milestones that specified … Right now, he is charging a flat rate of $6.90, but most expect either a per-mile rate or a dynamic price similar to Uber. Another key question that went unanswered was when the company felt it would no longer be necessary to employ a human safety monitor in the front passenger seat. Right now, scaling is inhibited by the presence of an onboard babysitter needed to prevent freak occurrences, like the recent case in which a monitor had to stop a Tesla from running a railroad crossing as a train was approaching. Take this statement for example, in which Musk reaffirmed comments earlier this year that his autonomous ride-hailing service would expand to most of the country by year-end. “We’ll technically be able to do it. Assuming we get regulatory approvals, it’s probably addressing half the population of the U.S. by the end of the year. But we are being very cautious, we don’t want to take any chances—we’re gonna go cautious. The service areas and the number of vehicles in operation will increase at a hyper-exponential rate.” That was one continuous answer. Broken down, Musk is arguing his four-week-old service that continues to operate with just around a dozen vehicles in one city will—in the course of only five months—expand in a way that is simultaneously both “very cautious” as well as “hyper-exponential.” “In the meanwhile, we’ll launch a service with a person in the driver’s seat just to expedite while we wait for regulatory approval,” said Tesla AI director Ashok Elluswamy on the call. But investors don’t want another Uber. For the business model to work, the human safety monitor needs to be removed from the car. Here as well there was no timetable—just the word “eventually” in the shareholder deck. None of this might be a problem were it not for Tesla’s struggling core car business. With vehicle sales down 13% through the first half, Musk on Wednesday scrapped his guidance but confirmed vehicle sales would definitely grow this year. Now the company says the “actual results will depend on a variety of factors.” Could a second straight year of declines be possible? In October, Musk was still promising a 20% volume increase minimum. The Tesla CEO also confirmed the low-cost model—effectively a cheaper Model Y—has been delayed. Volume production is now slated for the fourth quarter of this year. Until then, it wants to prioritize meeting demand from customers looking to buy a Tesla before the federal tax credit expires at the start of October. Starting that same month, however, the outlook begins to darken. “We probably could have a few rough quarters,” Musk conceded, citing Q4, Q1, and potentially Q2 as well. Then the script should flip once its upcoming Cybercab is deployed in sufficiently large numbers in its robotaxi fleet in the latter half of next year financed in part with the $37 billion in cash Tesla holds on its balance sheet. Fortunately, the upfront costs shouldn’t be too expensive for Tesla to finance. The two-seater was conceived to cut corners on performance, only aiming for a “gentle ride.” Since it’s not really meant for private ownership, it doesn’t need the kind of expensive propulsion system or finely tuned chassis that can deliver the speed, agility, or handling of a typical Tesla. There were some positives in the Q2 results. Automotive gross margins, excluding CO2 regulatory credits, came in at 15%, a 40 basis point improvement over last year, giving investors hope the downward trend may finally be forming a bottom. Nor were the $439 million in regulatory credits needed for the group to earn a profit either, thanks in large part to record profits from its industrial-size Megapack batteries. Sold to utilities for managing sudden peaks in electricity demand, its stationary energy storage solution constitutes a business with gross margins double those of its larger car operations. Tesla also expanded its Cortex data center in Austin by nearly a third, and now has the equivalent of 67,000 Nvidia H100 AI training chips. Musk also said his company’s own proprietary AI inference chip is built into every Tesla car and will soon become so intelligent it presents a threat to U.S. national security should it end up in the wrong hands. Referring to his upcoming AI5 chip that follows the current HW4 generation, Musk said: “It’s so powerful we’ll have to nerf it to some degree for markets outside the U.S. because it blows way past the export restrictions.” But this wasn’t sufficient for the market. True, it is not unusual for the stock to sell off after a business update, since Tesla quarterly calls are often viewed as “buy the rumor, sell the fact” trades. The news that emerged Wednesday proved, however, lean pickings for shareholders still willing to pay 140 times next year’s consensus earnings to own the stock, especially since the equity story hinges so heavily on the success of its maiden robotaxi fleet. “Investors were hungry for clear expectations about how many vehicles are on the road in Austin today and what it will end the quarter at,” Deepwater’s Munster added. “They wanted to hear that the company expects the human supervisor to be removed during the quarter or that the service will shift from being invite-only to public availability.” That hunger was not sated. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Ethereum Is Becoming Crypto’s Reserve Asset: New Research
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-crypto-reserve-asset-research/
Time Published: 2025-07-24T13:00:37Z
Full Content:
A new research from analytics firm Artemis argues that Ether is undergoing the same reputational pivot Bitcoin experienced in the mid-2010s, but on fundamentally different terms. “Evaluating ETH purely through the lens of cash flows or protocol fees is a category error,” writes lead author Kevin Li. “It is better understood as a scarce yet productive, programmable reserve asset whose value accrues through its role in securing, settling and powering an increasingly institutionalized on-chain economy.” Li begins by tackling the long-running critique that Ethereum’s flexible monetary policy disqualifies it as a store of value. He models a worst-case scenario in which every ETH in existence is staked and issuance hits its theoretical ceiling. Even then, annual inflation tops out at roughly 1.52 percent in 2025 and decays to 0.89 percent by 2125—well below the US dollar’s 6.36 percent average M2 expansion since 1998 and even beneath gold’s long-run annual supply growth. The paper argues that the combination of sublinear issuance and the EIP-1559 burn has already pushed net inflation near—or periodically below—zero, giving ETH a supply profile that “rivals gold while retaining the programmability of software.” Macro conditions provide the backdrop for the thesis. Artemis notes that decades of monetary expansion have eroded trust in fiat and driven investors toward alternative stores of value. The US consumer-price index has averaged 2.53 percent a year since 1998, but the money supply has grown more than twice as fast, a gap the report claims “may account for a significant share of nominal equity-market gains.” Ethereum’s adaptive monetary policy, Li contends, offers a disciplined alternative without sacrificing the network’s ability to pay validators. Institutional adoption is the second pillar of the argument. Over the past 12 months JPMorgan, BlackRock and Robinhood have each chosen Ethereum rails—either the base layer or an affiliated roll-up—for tokenized deposits, money-market funds and equity trading prototypes. The report cites BlackRock’s BUIDL fund and JPMorgan’s forthcoming JPMD deposit token as proof that blue-chip institutions are no longer experimenting on testnets but building products that will settle value at scale. “As traditional finance migrates on-chain, the need to hold and stake ETH becomes structural rather than discretionary,” Li writes. That dynamic is visible in on-chain data. Artemis calculates that the supply of stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets on Ethereum reached a record $123 billion in June, while the amount of ETH locked in validators climbed to 35.5 million. The year-on-year correlation between the value of on-chain assets and staked ETH exceeds 88 percent across every major category the firm tracks, reinforcing the idea that demand for security and settlement drives demand for the native token. Regulation, long the wild card for any staking-based value proposition, has started to tilt in Ethereum’s favor. On May 29 the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance issued guidance stating that protocol-level staking, delegated staking and certain custodial staking arrangements do not in themselves constitute securities offerings. While the ruling left room for fact-specific enforcement, it cleared the way for spot-ETH ETF filers to include staking provisions in their S-1 amendments. Several prospective issuers have since done exactly that, promising investors both passive exposure to ETH and a share of consensus rewards. The Artemis report also highlights an emerging “treasury-asset wave” reminiscent of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy in 2020. Sharplink Gaming disclosed in late May that it would begin allocating corporate cash to Ether, a move followed by a cluster of smaller US and Asian public companies. Together they now hold more than 730,000 ETH, or roughly $2.6 billion at current prices. The accumulation has coincided with a period of ETH outperformance versus BTC—an unusual trend in the current cycle, which has otherwise been dominated by Bitcoin narratives such as halving supply shocks and prospective US reserve holdings. Critics who argue that Layer 2 networks cannibalize Ethereum’s fee base “miss the point,” Li says. By off-loading execution while anchoring settlement and data availability to the base layer, roll-ups expand Ethereum’s total addressable market without eroding its security budget. Li compares the arrangement to the Federal Reserve System: “Regional banks handle day-to-day traffic, but ultimate settlement rests with the central bank.” In that analogy ETH is the reserve asset that guarantees finality. The paper concedes that other high-throughput Layer 1s, particularly Solana, have siphoned off “meme-coin velocity” and micro-transaction volume. Solana processed more transactions than Ethereum in five of the past six quarters. Yet Li argues that the market for assets requiring maximal security is “orders of magnitude” larger than the market for speculative trading throughput, especially as traditional finance tokenizes bonds, deposits and money-market funds. Perhaps the most pointed section of the report re-examines Bitcoin’s own “digital gold” narrative. Just as early critiques once dismissed BTC as volatile, illiquid and pointless, ETH today faces doubts about its identity. “Bitcoin users once had to justify why a purely digital bearer asset could compete with gold,” Li writes. “Ethereum users now have to justify why a programmable, yield-bearing, burn-limited asset can compete with bitcoin. The burden of proof is reversing.” After Ethereum’s long-awaited transition to proof-of-stake and barely two months after the SEC’s staking guidance, the conversation around ETH has shifted from “utility token” to something far closer to “reserve asset.” If Li’s thesis holds, future debates may revolve less around whether Ethereum can catch Bitcoin’s market cap and more around what happens when institutions treat Ether not as gasoline for smart contracts but as the base money of the emerging on-chain economy. At press time, ETH traded at $3,585. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: The investment chief at $10 trillion giant Vanguard says it’s time to pivot away from U.S. stocks

Shawn Tully is a senior editor-at-large at Fortune, covering the biggest trends in business, aviation, politics, and leadership. Greg Davis visited Fortune this month dressed like a Wall Street titan—and bearing a very un-Wall-Street message about a tepid future for U.S. stocks.On July 11, Davis––the president and chief investment officer of Vanguard Group––came to our offices in Manhattan’s Financial District for a chat with this reporter. Though Davis works from Vanguard’s mother ship (its buildings are all named for British vessels from the Napoleonic wars) in the tiny hamlet of Malvern, Pa., west of Philadelphia, he arrived attired in a tailored gray suit and purple silk tie combo that would have fit right in with the most formal of the investment banking cadre and portfolio managers headquartered nearby.Yet Davis’s message couldn’t have been more contrary to the fashionable view among the neighborhood’s rosy prognosticators. The 25-year Vanguard veteran’s outlook contradicts the prevailing position advanced by the big banks, research firms, and TV pundits that despite serial years of big gains, U.S. stocks remain a great buy. That bull case rests mainly on optimism that the Big Beautiful Bill’s deregulatory agenda and tax cuts will spur the economy, and that the AI revolution promises a new world of efficiencies that will shift earnings to super-fast track going forward. The powerful momentum that has driven the Nasdaq and S&P 500 to all time highs this week bolster their argument for more to come. Davis follows the Vanguard mindset that, arguably more than any other, revolutionized the investing world over the past half-century. The company’s founder, John Bogle, created the first index funds for ordinary investors in 1975, following the conviction that funds choosing individual stocks regularly fail to beat their benchmarks after fees, and that a pallet of diversified index funds, and later ETFs, that hold expenses to an absolute minimum, provide the best platform for achieving superior gains over the long-term. The top testament to the enduring validity of the Vanguard model: Over 80% of its ETFs and indexed mutual fund beat their peer-group averages over the past 10 years, measured by LSEG Lipper, largely courtesy of those super-tight expense ratios. The Vanguard model’s won such overwhelming favor that it now manages 28% of the combined U.S. mutual fund and ETF universe, and it’s gained 7 points in market share in the past decade. At $10 trillion in AUM, it ranks second only to BlackRock among all U.S. asset managers. Besides offering over 400 super-low-cost funds worldwide, Vanguard also provides investment advice as a firm, and through its army of financial advisers. A big part of the Vanguard formula: Periodically rebalancing from securities that get extremely pricey by historical standards into areas that are undervalued versus their norms. In our discussion, Davis provided a master class on how the dollars in profits you’re getting for each $100 you’re paying for a stock influences future returns, and why now is such a crucial time to shift from what’s highly, even dangerously expensive into safe areas that look like screaming buys. Put simply, Davis argues that U.S. equities are a victim of their own success. For Davis, the fabulous ride in recent years virtually guarantees that future returns will prove extremely disappointing versus outsized, double-digit gains investors have gotten used to, and that the investment pros predict will persist. The reason is simple: U.S. stocks have simply gotten so costly that their forward progress is destined to radically slow. “Our investment strategy group’s projection is that U.S. equity market returns are going to be much more muted in the future,” Davis warns. “Over the past ten years, the S&P returned an average of 12.4% annually. We’re predicting the figure to drop to between 3.8% and 5.8% (midpoint of 4.8%) over the next decade.” The basic market math, he contends, points to that outcome. Davis notes that the official price-to-earnings multiple on the S&P now stands at an extremely lofty 29.3. And when Vanguard uses a preferred gauge based on Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller’s Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings multiple, or CAPE––a measure that adjusts the PE by normalizing for spikes and valleys in earnings––it concludes that US stocks hover 49% over the top end of the group’s fair value range. Davis also points out that corporate profits are now extremely high by historical levels, and hence won’t grow nearly as fast from here as their jackrabbit pace of recent years. In other words, don’t count on an EPS explosion to solve the valuation problem. In fact, this reporter notes that contrary to what we’re constantly hearing about forthcoming double-digit increases in profits, the sprint has already slowed to a stroll. From Q4 of 2021 to Q1 of this year, S&P 500 EPS grew from $198 to $217, or 9.6% in over three years, a puny pace that doesn’t even match inflation. Davis explained how the longstanding bull market has wildly distorted the standard “60-40” portfolio. That classic construction of 60% stocks and 40% bonds has worked well in many periods, he notes. But today, folks who started at 60-40 a decade ago, and didn’t rebalance into bonds as equity prices swelled year after year, are now banking far too heavily on those richly-valued U.S. equities. “In the past 10 years, interest rates have mainly been very low, so bonds returned only around 2% a year, or 10% less than stocks,” declares Davis. “So the stock portion kept compounding at a high rate and getting bigger, and the bond portion kept shrinking as a share of the total. As a result, what started as a 60-40 mix is now 80-20 in favor of stocks.” To make matters worse, says Davis, “U.S. stocks outperformed international equities by 6 percentage points a year in the past decade. So 10 years ago, if you started with the standard split 70% U.S. and 30% foreign, you’d now be at 80% U.S. and 20% foreign.” Hence, sans rebalancing, an investor’s overall share of U.S. stocks would have gone from 42% to around two-thirds, a gigantic leap. Those weightings, he says, are lopsided in the wrong direction, in two ways—by holding far too big a percentage of stocks and not enough bonds, and within the equity portion, not owning enough foreign shares. “If you look at the bond market today and the way yields have risen, we’re projecting that you’re going to pick up very similar returns in a mix of U.S. and foreign bonds as you’ll get in U.S. equities, or also 4% to 5%. So the expectations are comparable, but you’ll have much less volatility on the bond side,” avows Davis, adding, “What’s the big advantage to betting on risky stocks when you can get 4.3% on three-month Treasuries?” Hence, Davis makes a daring recommendation: Investors should reverse the classic blend and go with 60% bonds and 40% stocks. For the fixed income portion, he notes, Vanguard’s Total World Bond ETF (BNDW) offers a blend of domestic and international fixed income, encompassing government bonds, corporates, agencies, mortgages, and asset backed securities. In addition, Vanguard projects that foreign shares over the next ten years will generate average returns of 7%, waxing the 5% or so for U.S. equities. Hence, Davis recommends that in the 40% dedicated to stocks, investors lean heavily to the international side by splitting the allocation evenly, or 20% and 20%, between stateside and international stocks. The Vanguard FTSE All World ex US ETF (VEU) would fit the slot reserved for the international allotment. In summary, Davis is advising a radical rebalancing for folks who let their U.S. stocks swallow a bigger and bigger part of their portfolios as bonds and international shares underperformed year after year. So here’s are allocations he’d recommend for the decade ahead: 60% fixed income, 20% international equities, and—gulp—just 20% in U.S. stocks. Once again, that number compares to the around two-thirds you’d hold in U.S. equities if you’d started at 60-40 ten years ago and just let your gains on U.S. stocks rip without any rebalancing. I ran some numbers on the returns you’d garner in the two scenarios: First, if you don’t rejigger and keep holding two-thirds of your portfolio in U.S. stocks, and second, if you do what Davis advocates and put 60% in bonds, and park more of the equity share abroad. In both cases, the projected future return is just over 5% yearly. No big difference in returns over the next decade. So why choose the Davis formula? The edge in making the big shift: The path will be much smoother, predictable, and less nerve-rattling that sticking with a huge over-weighting in U.S. stocks. Of course, Davis recommends rebalancing gradually, and funding as much of it as possible with fresh savings and reinvestment of dividends and high interest payments from fixed income assets. Davis isn’t recommending crypto investing as a means of boosting your returns at a time when U.S. stocks won’t come close to matching their past performance. “I got into this business around the time of the dot.com era,” he told me. “Anything with a dot.com behind it went to the moon. Some were actually really good businesses, however the majority were not. Good things can come out of crypto like blockchain, and that technology can reduce costs in the financial sector and improve speed, so we think there are some good fundamental components to it. But to us investing in Bitcoin is speculation.” For Davis, Bitcoin offers none of the advantages of traditional investments that generate interest payments, or earnings that feed capital gains and dividends. “It’s not investing in a cash flow generating business, it’s not investing in bonds where you have a commitment to getting a coupon payment every six months, then principal at maturity,” he explains. “It’s basically looking to sell to someone willing to pay more than you did. And the whole idea that a limited supply of Bitcoin will drive up its value is questionable when you consider that there’s an unlimited supply of new types of crypto that could be created. So I personally don’t get it. Vanguard won’t launch a Bitcoin fund. We just don’t see it as a core part of an investment portfolio.” Davis grew up on an Army base near Nuremberg, Germany, the child of a father in an Airborne division and a German mother. As a kid, he mainly spoke German, including with his grandmother, and didn’t live in the U.S. until age 7. “When I go to Germany and speak the language, people can tell I’ve kept the Bavarian dialect,” he declares. He started at Penn State pursuing aeronautical engineering, but lack of skill in mechanical drawing forced him to switch—to a major in insurance. “Penn State was one of the few schools that offered that unusual major,” he says. Davis went on to get an MBA at Wharton, and after a brief stint in a Merrill Lynch training program, got an offer from Vanguard that would require a move from Wall Street to the sleepy suburbs of Philly. Davis took the job in part because Vanguard was then a fast-growing shop, where he figured his chances of advancement would be better than at a huge bank or brokerage. He was especially attracted to Vanguard’s highly unusual “cooperative” model, where the funds––meaning the investors––are the shareholders. “So because we have economies of scale where over time our revenues grow faster than expenses, we can rebate that money back to investors by lowering fees,” he says. Davis proudly notes that Vanguard has made 2,000 such reductions in its history, and especially that in February it announced the biggest decrease ever—a cut of $350 million across 68 mutual funds and ETFs in equities and fixed income. Vanguard’s whole approach where the objective is to constantly lower fees is highly un-Wall Street. So is Davis’s contrarian counsel to follow what the valuations and history tells us, to shift from stocks that are extremely expensive and whose prices can’t grow to the sky, despite what the bulls are saying. It’s a sobering, cautionary tale. But it’s one that makes eminent sense. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

EDIMBURGO – Cuando en 2021 se celebró la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático en Glasgow (COP26), Mark Carney era una figura imponente en el mundo financiero. En aquel momento, quien hoy es primer ministro de Canadá (hecho atribuible en gran medida al llamado del presidente de los Estados Unidos Donald Trump a que Canadá se convierta en el 51.º estado) era enviado especial de las Naciones Unidas para la acción climática y las finanzas. En la COP26, Carney anunció la creación de la Alianza Financiera de Glasgow para las Cero Emisiones Netas (GFANZ por la sigla en inglés), que sería madre de tres hijas precoces: la Alianza Bancaria para las Cero Emisiones Netas (NZBA), la Alianza de Aseguradoras para las Cero Emisiones Netas (NZIA) y la iniciativa de Gestoras de Activos para las Cero Emisiones Netas (NZAM). En opinión de algunos escépticos, todo eso no era más que un montón de ceros; pero Carney aseguró a un mundo expectante que «no es bla bla bla», y que el concepto de cero emisiones netas sería la «infraestructura crítica del nuevo sistema financiero». ¿Qué ha sido pues de la iniciativa de Glasgow con los años? ¿En qué extremo del continuo de «infraestructura crítica bla bla bla» estamos? Hay que decir que el paso del tiempo no ha sido benévolo con la sopa de letras de Carney. A principios de este año, los mayores bancos estadounidenses (JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs y el resto) se retiraron de la NZBA, evidentemente temerosos de presiones políticas del nuevo gobierno de Trump. A los grandes bancos estadounidenses se sumaron los canadienses, mostrando escasa lealtad a la creación de quien más tarde sería su primer ministro. Y en abril, los miembros restantes diluyeron los compromisos iniciales: fijaron como nuevo criterio un máximo de 2 °C de aumento de temperaturas (en vez de los ya hace mucho irrelevantes 1,5 °C) y abandonaron el objetivo de llegar a cero emisiones netas en 2050. Pero la hemorragia no terminó allí. Este mes, HSBC anunció su deserción, y parece muy probable que habrá otros. Hoy los miembros representan un poco más de la mitad del patrimonio de los fundadores; pero todavía quedan algunos bancos comprometidos y la NZBA sigue viva. Our Summer Sale has begun.

Subscribe Now No puede decirse lo mismo de su hermana menor, la NZIA. Incluso antes de la elección de Trump, algunos procuradores de estados bajo control republicano, cuestionando la formulación conjunta de objetivos climáticos, acusaron de cartelización a los principales miembros de la entidad. Puede que sus motivos hayan sido más bien distintos, pero tenían un argumento válido desde el punto de vista legal: los fundadores no habían analizado lo suficiente lo que esa formulación conjunta de compromisos implicaba. Tras una serie de retiradas, en abril de 2024 la NZIA colapsó. Ha aparecido una especie de sustituto, el Foro para la Transición de las Aseguradoras a las Cero Emisiones Netas, cuyos miembros están sujetos a obligaciones más laxas y sin formulación de metas ni publicación de información obligatoria. El foro también asegura que tiene abogados internos encargados de vigilar cualquier posible infracción futura de la legislación antimonopolio. Para completar la familia, la tercera hija (NZAM) también experimentó en enero una andanada de retiradas, encabezada por BlackRock, que provocó la suspensión de sus actividades y la cancelación de la lista pública de firmantes. No está claro cuándo terminará la suspensión (si termina). Ya hemos hablado de las hijas; ¿qué ha sido de la madre? Técnicamente, la GFANZ todavía existe, pero tras una remodelación sustancial. Ahora se describe como un «grupo de directores» independiente sin precalificaciones para el ingreso; y ya no apunta a ser guardián del objetivo de cero emisiones netas sino un facilitador de financiación para la transición energética, tarea loable, pero lejos de la imaginada en un principio. Es difícil ver en todos estos hechos tomados en conjunto otra cosa que no sea un debilitamiento significativo del compromiso del sector financiero con el apoyo a la transición verde. Pero ¿dónde están las autoridades regulatorias, que los presionaban para que se pusieran a la altura del desafío y fueran parte de la solución al cambio climático, en vez de convertirse en futuras víctimas? En 2017, ocho bancos centrales formaron la Red para la Ecologización del Sistema Financiero (NGFS), una «coalición de voluntarios» con inclusión del Reino Unido, Francia y China, pero no de Estados Unidos. La Reserva Federal (siempre tan orgullosa de su independencia política) decidió sumarse tras la victoria electoral de Joe Biden en 2020, para retirarse a principios de este año. Pero en este caso, otros bancos centrales siguen comprometidos. Algunos (por ejemplo el Banco de Inglaterra) le restaron importancia a las pruebas de estrés climático, pero los miembros de la NGFS (que ahora son unos 140) no han dejado de creer que el aumento de las temperaturas medias implica riesgo de disrupción económica y que la transición energética creará ganadores y perdedores. Un análisis reciente de la NGFS sugiere que los riesgos económicos son mayores de lo que se pensaba. Si los bancos y las aseguradoras no comprenden lo que está en juego, pueden sufrir efectos negativos, que a las otras amenazas que enfrentamos, les sumarán la inestabilidad financiera. Pero que nadie crea que el resto del mundo puede seguir como hasta ahora. Hay señales inequívocas de que Estados Unidos está presionando a los organismos de regulación internacionales para que le resten importancia a su trabajo en materia climática. El último comunicado del Consejo de Estabilidad Financiera (FSB) señala que «aunque muchos miembros consideran que hay necesidad de hacer más, algunos creen que la labor completada hasta ahora es suficiente», y parece que los «algunos» se han impuesto a los «muchos». También el Comité de Basilea degradó su trabajo en lo referido a la publicación de información relacionada con el clima y eliminó cualquier obligación de cumplimiento. Aunque hay que decir que el Comité de Basilea rechazó un pedido de Estados Unidos de disolver su grupo de trabajo sobre el clima, parece que los representantes estadounidenses ya no asisten a las reuniones, lo que evidentemente disminuye su eficacia. ¿Hacia dónde vamos pues? La evidencia científica indica a las claras que el impacto del calentamiento global en el sector financiero crece día a día, pero la resistencia estadounidense a cualquier acción resultante por parte de las empresas o de las autoridades regulatorias es cada vez más firme. Y como es bien sabido, cuando una fuerza irresistible se encuentra con un objeto inamovible, es muy difícil predecir el resultado. En este caso, mi apuesta es por la fuerza irresistible. Habrá un incidente (tal vez el primero sea en el mundo de los seguros) que nos enseñará la importancia de apuntalar las defensas. Pero aun así, las autoridades regulatorias fuera de Estados Unidos tienen que mantener la presión.

Title: Has Trump Killed Green Finance?
URL: https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-trying-to-end-green-finance-by-howard-davies-2025-07
Time Published: 2025-07-24T11:30:09Z
Full Content:
Just four years ago, the world's banks, insurers, and asset managers were pledging to align their operations with the goal of achieving net-zero emissions, in order to mitigate the risks to financial stability posed by climate change. Now, however, those pledges have been sharply curtailed, owing to US pressure since January. EDINBURGH – At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26), back in 2021, Mark Carney bestrode the financial world like a colossus. Now Canada’s prime minister, thanks in large part to US President Donald Trump’s call to make the country America’s 51st state, in 2021 he was the UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance. At COP26, Carney announced the creation of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), the parent of three precocious children, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), and the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative. All that amounted to a whole lot of zeros, in the view of some sceptics, but Carney assured an expectant world that “It’s not blah blah blah,” and that net zero would form the “critical infrastructure of the new financial system.” So, how well has the Glasgow initiative aged? At which end of the critical infrastructure-blah blah blah spectrum do we find ourselves? The intervening years have not been kind to the alphabet soup Carney cooked up. At the beginning of this year, the biggest US banks – JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and the rest – pulled out of the NZBA, clearly fearing political pressure from Trump’s new administration. The big US banks were soon followed by the Canadian banks, showing little loyalty to their future prime minister’s creation. In April, the remaining members watered down the initial commitments, focusing on alignment with a maximum 2º Celsius temperature rise, rather than the long mooted 1.5ºC, and abandoning the target of full net-zero compliance by 2050. But that did not stem the flow of departures. Earlier this month, HSBC announced its defection, and it seems highly likely that others will do likewise. Today the members represent only a little over half the assets of the founders, but there are still some committed banks, and the NZBA remains alive. Our Summer Sale has begun.

Subscribe Now That is more than can be said for its little sister, the NZIA. Even before Trump’s election, some attorneys general from Republican-controlled states, raising concerns about collaborative climate pledges, had targeted the major members on antitrust grounds. Their motives might have been rather different, but legally they had a point. The founders had not properly thought through the implications of the pledges they were making. After a spate of withdrawals, in April 2024 the NZIA collapsed. There has been a replacement of sorts, in the form of the Forum for Insurance Transition to Net Zero. The forum’s membership obligations are more flexible, and there are no targets or reporting obligations. It also claims to have armed itself with in-house lawyers to guard against any potential future contraventions of antitrust law. To complete the set, the third child, the NZAM, also experienced a spate of withdrawals in January, led by BlackRock. That led to a suspension of its activities, and the removal of its published list of signatories. It is not clear when, if ever, the suspension will be lifted. We have accounted for the children, but what about the parent? GFANZ still technically exists, but has been substantially remodeled. It now describes itself as an independent “Principals Group” with no pre-entry qualifications, and has shifted its focus from being a net-zero gatekeeper to becoming a facilitator of finance to fund the energy transition – a worthy task, but far from what was initially envisaged. It is hard to see these developments, taken together, as anything other than a significant watering down of the financial sector’s commitment to supporting the green transition. But where are the regulators, who were exerting pressure on their charges to step up and ensure that they were part of the climate-change solution, rather than being casualties of the problem? The Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) was created by a coalition of eight willing central banks in 2017. The coalition included the United Kingdom, France, and China, but not the United States. After Joe Biden’s election in 2020, the Federal Reserve, which prides itself on its political independence, decided to join, only to withdraw earlier this year. But in this case, other central banks remain committed. Some, like the Bank of England, have de-emphasized their climate stress-tests, but NGFS members, now numbering some 140, still believe that rising average temperatures threaten economic disruption, and that the energy transition will create winners and losers. Recent analysis by the NGFS suggests that the economic risks are greater than previously thought. If banks and insurers do not understand the implications, they may be adversely affected, adding financial instability to the other threats we face. It would be idle to imagine, though, that the rest of the world can continue as before. There are unmistakable signs that the US is putting pressure on international regulatory bodies to downgrade their climate-related work. The last communiqué from the Financial Stability Board noted that “while many members feel there is a need for more work, some feel that the work completed to date is sufficient,” and it seems that the “some” have dominated the “many.” Similarly, the Basel Committee has downgraded its work on climate-related disclosures and removed any requirement to comply. The Basel Committee did refuse a US request to disband its climate task force, but the US representatives reportedly simply do not turn up, which clearly impacts its effectiveness. So, where do we go from here? All the scientific evidence suggests that the impact of global warming on the financial sector is growing relentlessly, but US resistance to any resulting action by firms or their regulators is becoming firmer. The outcome of a clash between an irresistible force and an immovable object is notoriously hard to predict. In this case, my bet is on the irresistible force. A bad outcome, perhaps first in the insurance world, will illustrate the importance of shoring up our defenses. But even then, non-US regulators need to keep up the pressure.

Title: Crypto Prices Dump as FTX Plans September Payout: $SNORT Is a Smart Buy Now
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-market-is-down-as-snort-might-be-a-smart-buy/
Time Published: 2025-07-24T10:37:57Z

The entire crypto market is on a down-drift after what seems to be a prolonged market correction, forcing Bitcoin down to $118,148 after a 0.40% slip over the past 24 hours. While there are multiple proposed reasons for the current market shift, one of them seems to connect to FTX’s payment plan set to come into effect in September. The now-defunct exchange will release another court-approved payment round of at least $1.9B through the same third-party entities: Kraken, Payoneer, and BitGo. This marks the third big payout in 2025 as part of FTX’s efforts to repay their creditors and redistribute $14.5B in damages. FTX’s upcoming payment could explain, at least in part, the current market shift by digging up the doubt and fear linked to the disgraced exchange, following Sam Bankman-Fried’s scam. An even bigger factor for the current market sentiment seems to be Bitcoin’s $86M in outflows, with BlackRock ($IBIT) and Fidelity ($FBTC) bearing most of the burden, with $142.48M and $227.24M respectively. Trader T is the bearer of bad news, keeping track of Bitcoin’s performance and highlighting the three consecutive days of consistent outflows. The outflows aren’t bad on their own, but their impact on the market is. Entities like Fidelity, for instance, may be forced to liquidate their Bitcoin holdings to cover the withdrawals, which could increase the sell pressure, amplify price volatility, and push market sentiment even lower. But what are the triggers behind this sudden market shift, given that FTX’s payment plan couldn’t account for it on its own? Several factors may contribute to the current market shift: However, while the market is on the back foot, it’s unlikely to backpedal for too long. The Fear and Greed Index is already telling half the story, with the community sentiment still borderline extremely greedy. Trader Tardigrade seems to nourish similar sentiments, stating that, based on the market’s performance, crypto is set to become the largest asset in the world. Another crypto analyst, Titan of Crypto, hints at a second Breakout coming, which would be the final hurdle before Altcoin Season 3.0. With the market winding for a coming rally, some assets may experience higher gains than others, especially those with blockchain utility and massive long-term potential. Snorter Token is one of them, introducing the Snorter Bot, the trading companion which snipes hot tokens milliseconds after liquidity appears. Snorter Token’s ($SNORT) Snorter Bot promises to become the most proficient coin hunter, thanks to its ease of use, integrated scam alerts, protecting against suspicious projects, and its appetite for hot and booming tokens. The Aardvark sniper is the perfect solution to manual coin hunting, which demands high technical knowledge and subjects you to potential scams like honeypots and rug pulls. The Bot operates in its Telegram chat-only, centralizing its activity in one place and rendering the need for multiple wallets, plug-ins, and browser extensions obsolete. You only need to instruct the Bot accordingly and watch it claim its victims milliseconds after liquidity becomes available. This reaction time puts UIs like Raydium, Pump Fun, and Jupiter to shame. Based on these facts, Snorter Token is set to become one of the best meme coins on the market, following successful implementation and witnessing widespread adoption. The project is currently in presale, having accumulated over $2.3M with a token price of $0.0991. Given Snorter Bot’s roadmap and efficiency, we expect the project to witness growing success post launch. In that context, $SNORT could easily push to $0.94 shortly after its public listing. If you want to support the project and buy yourself some $SNORT, go to the presale page and place your order today. Despite the heavy Bitcoin outflows and the perceived market uncertainty, the bullish market sentiment seems to suggest that what we’re seeing is not recession, but rather market correction, following the recent generalized rally. We expect Bitcoin to push again soon, once it clears the psychological threshold of $120K, at which point projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT) will also steam up.

Title: Dave Vellante’s Breaking Analysis: The complete collection

Time Published: 2025-07-24T10:33:12Z

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JULY 24 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution?

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world.

Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JULY 24 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider.

Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies.

Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JULY 24 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms.

Title: Inside Private Equity’s $29 Trillion Retirement Savings Grab

ByHank Tucker andSergei Klebnikov ByHank Tucker, Forbes Staff andSergei Klebnikov, Forbes Staff. Jack Bogle became a legend by popularizing low-cost passive index funds at the Vanguard Group, which he founded in 1975 after spending the first 23 years of his career at Wellington Management. “Don’t look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the haystack,” he famously mused. That philosophy—be the market, don’t try to beat it—spawned generations of index fund-loving, buy-and-hold “Bogleheads” who have made Vanguard into what it is today: a $10 trillion-in-assets mutual fund colossus serving more than 50 million individual customers. Over the same half-century, private equity was also growing into a more than $10 trillion-in-assets industry—in a very different way. This one was built on the promise of market-beating returns produced by managers demanding high fees: usually a percent of assets (typically 2% a year) and a hefty cut of profits (typically 20%). Plus they insisted on a long-term commitment of assets by their institutional investors, inclu­ding pension funds, college endowments and foundations. Vanguard, which Bogle set up to be owned by its investors, has produced a lot of prosperous retirees but zero money-manager billionaires. Private equity, with its profit share (known as carried interest), has minted dozens of them. Stephen Schwarzman, chairman, CEO and cofounder of Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity manager with more than $1 trillion in assets under management, is worth an estimated $50 billion. So it was a bit jarring, culturally and historically speaking, when Vanguard and Wellington announced in April that they had formed a “strategic alliance” with Blackstone to offer products for individual investors blending private and public market assets. Jarring but maybe not so surprising given that the heavyweights of private equity and retail distribution are now pairing off with an urgency that suggests they’re desperate to avoid missing out on the next big moneymaking opportunity: getting into Americans’ 401(k)s and IRAs, which hold $29 trillion in assets. And the Trump administration aims to help them. In February, Boston’s State Street Investment Management, which created the exchange-traded-fund business back in 1993, kicked off the action by offering the first ETF with a mix of public and private debt, with the latter sourced from private equity giant Apollo Global ($785 billion under management). Then, a couple months later, State Street announced the launch of an “Index Plus” retirement target date fund series—90% index funds with a 10% kicker of Apollo private market assets. In May, Empower, a top player in the market for small-company 401(k)s, said it’s working with Apollo, Franklin Templeton, Goldman Sachs and others to offer retirement savers collective investment trusts containing a mix of private equity, private credit and real estate. And in July, Voya Financial, another big 401(k) player, announced it was teaming up with private credit’s Blue Owl Capital on a new series of blended products. There’s no mystery why private asset mana­gers are keen to play. After years of beating public stock markets, private equity’s average annual return has lagged stocks by more than three points over the last three years (see “Turn of Fortunes”). A slowdown of exit deals has led to a glut of aging assets in private equity funds. New funds raised by the industry have plunged 39% since 2021 as clients have fewer payouts to reinvest and some college endowments and pension funds are free­zing or even reducing their private asset allocations (see “A Slowing Spigot”). Private asset managers have been gathering money from high-net-worth individuals for more than a decade. Until now, though, they haven’t cracked regular investors’ $29 trillion retirement nest egg—$12 trillion in defined contribution workplace plans like 401(k)s and $17 trillion sitting in individual retirement accounts. That’s now changing. Crucially, President Joe Biden’s Department of Labor threw cold water on private assets in 401(k)s, but President Donald Trump is reportedly close to signing an executive order specifically encouraging alternative assets in the accounts. The mutual fund and retail distribution companies see a win here too. Their margins have shrunk as competition and the share of money in low-cost index funds have grown. A private-assets kicker is a new way to differentiate their offerings and charge higher fees. Ordinary investors? They may or may not be winners. More options are almost always a good thing, but they need to be careful of higher fees and less liquidity. Plus, assessing the performance of these new hybrid private products will be difficult. In an interview with Forbes in June 2017, a year and a half before his death at 89, Bogle wasn’t giving any ground. “The idea of making money for the funds’ shareholders is counter-opposed to the idea of making money for fund managers,” he declared. Wellington Management CEO Jean Hynes, ensconced in an office on the top floor of a 31-story tower overlooking Boston Harbor, likes the long view: The 56-year-old has spent her entire career at the firm. She was raised in the Boston suburb of Milton as one of six children born to Irish immigrants—her father was a bricklayer—who believed, she says, in investing through their children; they spent their money sending them to Catholic school and college. Hynes wound up at Wellesley College, where she majored in economics and interned for a local stockbroker. After graduating in 1991, she was hired by Wellington as an administrative assistant. Her detailed notes at morning investing meetings impressed the late Ed Owens, who managed the Vanguard Health Care Fund to a 16.4% average annual return over 28 years before retiring in 2012. Hynes became his research assistant, protégé and, eventually, a fund manager herself. “It was a match made in heaven from day one,” she says. “He’s probably one of the top 25 investors of all time, and that’s who I learned from and worked with for 20 years.” After winning the CEO job in 2021, Hynes got some advice from health care chiefs she knew. Merck’s Ken Frazier (now retired) told her that of all the decisions he made daily as CEO, only four really mattered. The lesson: Get the big swings right. Hynes sees the alliance with Blackstone as one of those big decisions. She ticks off the trends she has seen—actively managed equity, an explosion of fixed income, the dominance of index funds and, now, alternative investments. And she makes a credible case for why Main Street investors might want to get into private assets. “If you look holistically at the economy, 20 years ago the average person who invested and bought mutual funds could invest in the whole economy. And that’s not true today,” she says. “You have a whole part of the economy that is only for the institutional investor, and that’s all the private companies.... It’s fair that more individuals have access to that.” While Wellington has always been an active manager, it is deeply intertwined with Vanguard’s low-cost passive investing DNA. The relationship dates to Bogle’s firing as Wellington’s CEO in 1974 during a brutal bear market. A boardroom fight and peace treaty eventually left him in charge of a new company (Vanguard) that would administer funds, while Wellington controlled investment management and distribution. Bogle told Forbes in 2017 that he launched low-cost index funds and direct-to-consumer sales in part because it allowed him to do an end run around Wellington by claiming there was no money management or distribution involved. A half-century later, Wellington is still the largest external advisor for Vanguard’s actively managed funds. The Vanguard Wellington Fund, the nation’s oldest balanced mutual fund (two-thirds stocks, one-third bonds) has returned an average of 8.3% annually since inception in 1929. It charges a modest 0.25% of assets and has $115 billion in assets. While Wellington has dabbled in private markets for a decade, they still amount to only $9 billion of the $1.2 trillion in assets it manages, less than 0.8%. So last year, when Hynes was ready for her big swing, Wellington approached Blackstone about teaming up. “We’ve never thought that we would be good at buyouts, taking a company private and managing a company and fixing it. That’s not our skill set,” says Wellington managing partner Terry Burgess, who supervises the team tasked with steering the alliance’s funds. Its first product, the WVB All Markets Fund, is a closed-end “interval fund”—meaning it will offer quarterly redemptions to investors for liquidity and could be the centerpiece of a diversified portfolio. Public stocks (from Vanguard funds and direct Wellington investments) will be 40% to 60% of assets; bonds (through actively managed Vanguard funds) will be 15% to 30%; and private Blackstone funds will make up 25% to 40%. Wellington will determine exactly how assets are allocated. The preliminary prospectus leaves the door open for exposure to private equity, credit, real estate and privately owned infrastructure. It doesn’t specify what the management fee will be, but it will be on top of the fees in the underlying funds. If the overall fund is down in value due to a decline in the public markets, Wellington will reimburse it for Blackstone’s performance fees—that way, retail investors sitting on losses from WVB wouldn’t get whacked with a stiff performance fee regardless. The WVB Fund will be marketed first to wealthy clients through financial advisors and family offices. But all eyes are on the 401(k) prize. “Do I think over time, privates will start to serve more of a role when it comes to target date funds? I do,” says Vanguard president and chief investment officer Greg Davis, noting that the timing will depend on how comfortable plan sponsors (meaning employers) are with adding higher-cost products to their offerings. It’s notable that across the industry, the new private asset–tinged investments are being sold first to accounts managed by financial advisors and to target date funds, which are managed by investment pros, with allocations based on a saver’s expected (i.e., target) retirement date. “It’s a simple equation,” Vanguard founder Jack Bogle told Forbes in 2017. “Gross return minus costs equals net return, which is a universal principle in investing that I put to work after a long struggle.” Target dates are an obvious entry point for two reasons. First, they’re growing like crazy. Thanks to Congress and regulators, millions of workers are being automatically enrolled in 401(k)s, with their contributions (and employer matches) funneled into target dates by default. According to Morningstar, over the last 15 years, assets in these funds have grown at an astounding 30% annual compound rate and now amount to $4 trillion. Vanguard controls 37% of the target date market, more than double the share of its nearest competitor, Fidelity Investments. The second reason is that professional management of target dates blunts the criticism that average investors won’t be able to judge the performance of hard-to-value private assets. “I think over time, just like there are Morningstar ratings of all sorts of public mutual funds, when you look out five, ten years from now, all these funds are going to be ranked based on performance,” says Jonathan Gray, Blackstone’s president and chief operating officer. “That is critically important.” Private equity pioneer KKR launched in 1976 with cash from an insurance company and wealthy backers. But by 1978, it had money from Oregon’s public pension plans, and others soon followed. Today, public pensions allocate an average 23% of assets to alternative investments, the National Association of State Retirement Administrators reports. College endowments began piling aboard after David Swensen took over Yale’s endowment in 1985 and bolstered returns by diversifying into private assets. Today, endowments allocate an average 26% of assets to private markets, accor­ding to Cambridge Associates. Harvard has 39% in private equity; Princeton has 41%. Now some of these traditional sources are pulling back. As America’s richest colleges face deep federal funding cuts and a federal tax as high as 8% (up from 1.4%) on endowment income, Yale, Harvard and others are said to be selling private equity investments on the secondary market. The University of California system is cutting back on its target allocation for private investments in its endowments and pension funds, even as it is working with State Street to make private assets available in employees’ retirement savings plans. Traditional pension plans, particularly private ones, are diminishing in relative importance as employers shift the retirement burden to workers. Back in 2000, traditional pensions—public and private combined—held roughly the same $5 trillion as 401(k)s and IRAs. Now it’s $12 trillion and $29 trillion, respectively, according to the Investment Company Institute. Private asset managers have been wooing financial advisors and their wealthy clients with perpetual capital funds, which often allow up to 5% of investors to cash out each quarter. An early example was the Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, launched in 2017. It now has $53 billion in net assets. Blackstone Private Credit Fund, launched in 2021, has $72 billion. All told, Blackstone manages $270 billion from individuals, and this market is growing with a boost from cloud-based platforms for investment advisors. Example: BlackRock, which manages $12.5 trillion in assets, recently teamed up with fintechs GeoWealth and iCapital to create model portfolios holding both private and public assets. Joan Solotar, Blackstone’s head of global private wealth, says most individual investors in private markets have $5 million or more in investable assets, but those with at least $1 million are now being actively targeted. “It’s still quite early for investors below a million dollars,” she adds. Except when it comes to 401(k)s and target date funds. This does not come without risk. In a recent report, Moody’s laid out a series of worries about the push to put private assets into ordinary Americans’ portfolios. A big one is that Main Street investors, used to quick access to their cash, will create liquidity risks. “These fund structures haven’t really been tested extensively at periods of market stress,” says Alexandra Aspioti, a Moody’s senior private credit analyst. “Retail investors tend to be more sensitive to market volatility and increase redemption requests during periods of stress—this in turn can lead to further volatility.” Another worry Moody’s describes: All those extra dollars sloshing around will encourage private asset managers to make dumber deals, particularly in credit. The credit risk is real and growing. Private lenders face fewer regulatory requirements than traditional banks, which is largely why they financed 77% of private equity buyouts last year, according to Preqin. Private loans don’t trade and are valued only quarterly, with estimates that are often well off the mark. The International Monetary Fund warned last year that private lenders’ connections to private equity-backed companies could allow systemic problems to go undetected for too long. As for retail investors and liquidity risk, there have already been scares. Blackstone had to limit redemption requests in its real estate income trust in late 2022 and most of 2023 when individuals spooked by rising interest rates raced for the exits. The market rebounded, and Blackstone is back to honoring 100% of repurchase requests, but there’s little assurance that a similar situation won’t result in a future crash. Another concern: As exit deals from private equity funds have slowed, a fast-growing secondary market, including so-called continuation funds, has emerged, with a record $160 billion in transaction volume in 2024. With continuation funds, asset managers in essence are using new investors’ money to pay off old ones. Orlando Bravo, cofounder and managing partner of $184 billion (assets) Thoma Bravo, has cautioned that in this financial game of musical chairs, retail investors who are late to the party might get saddled with continuation funds with underperforming, hard-to-sell assets. Wellington’s Burgess promises that individual investors in the Wellington-Vanguard-Blackstone product will have access to the same private funds as Blackstone’s institutional clients—not the rejects. And he insists that the proposed fund will be able to withstand waves of withdrawal requests. “There’s 70% of it that’s public, and that’s a really big buffer to make sure you can maintain your liquidity profile,” he says. “We’ve tested it in [severe] down markets, and it’s gone to a level that’s still below what we would consider to be a pain point.” Then there are the objections raised by the Biden administration: that private assets might be too expensive and complex for 401(k)s. “These products are harder to understand and harder to value—it’s very different from looking at individual stocks traded on the public market or mutual funds,” says Lisa Gomez, who served under Biden as the Department of Labor’s assistant secretary for employee benefits security. But private asset managers are betting that the Trump administration will dismiss such worries and are hoping it—and the Republican Congress—will provide some protection from worker lawsuits for employers who offer the new products in their 401(k)s. That could further line the pockets of the wealthiest people in finance. It also could be great for individual investors, who will no longer be locked out of the type of lucrative private investments that have made the nation’s colleges and pension plans so rich for so long. With so much information soon to be available at their fingertips, retail investors might prove to be smarter than Wall Street thinks. They need to keep an eye on fees, and there is risk, for sure. But blue-chip financials like Blackstone, Vanguard and Wellington are going to be extra-careful not to saddle retirement savers with lousy private investments, thereby damaging their brands. Other outfits might be less cautious—caveat emptor—but democratizing investing is well worth the attendant dangers.

Title: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton Is Outsourcing More of His Office’s Work to Costly Private Lawyers

Despite having an office with hundreds of attorneys, Ken Paxton frequently opts to hire private lawyers. One cost taxpayers more than $24,000 in one day.

Sign up for ProPublica’s Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox as soon as they are published. Also, sign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. One day in late May 2024, lawyer Zina Bash spent 6 1/2 hours working on a case against Facebook parent company Meta on behalf of the state of Texas. She reviewed draft legal filings. She participated in a court-ordered mediation session and then discussed the outcome with state Attorney General Ken Paxton. In her previous job as senior counsel on Paxton’s leadership team, that labor would have cost Texas taxpayers $641. But Bash had moved to private practice. Paxton hired her firm to work on the Meta case, allowing her to bill $3,780 an hour, so that day of work will cost taxpayers $24,570. In the past five years, Paxton has grown increasingly reliant on pricey private lawyers to argue cases on behalf of the state, rather than the hundreds of attorneys who work within his office, an investigation by The Texas Tribune and ProPublica found. These are often attorneys, like Bash, with whom Paxton has personal or political ties. In addition to Bash, one such contract went to Tony Buzbee, the trial lawyer who successfully defended Paxton during his 2023 impeachment trial on corruption charges. Three other contracts went to firms whose senior attorneys have donated to Paxton’s political campaigns. Despite these connections and what experts say are potential conflicts of interest, Paxton does not appear to have recused himself from the selection process. Although he is not required to by law, this raises a concern about appearing improper, experts who study attorneys general said. Paxton appears to have also outsourced cases more frequently than his predecessors, available records show. And he’s inked the kind of contingent-fee contracts, in which firms receive a share of a settlement if they win, far more often than the attorneys general in other large states, including California, New York and Pennsylvania. Since 2015, the New York and California attorneys general have awarded zero contingent-fee contracts; Pennsylvania’s has signed one. During that period, Paxton’s office approved 13. One of those was with Bash’s firm, Chicago-based Keller Postman, at the time known as Keller Lenkner, which she joined as partner in February 2021 after resigning from her job at the attorney general’s office. Paxton had signed a contract with the company two months earlier to investigate Google for deceptive business practices and violations of antitrust law. A little more than a year later, Bash’s firm won a state contract to work on the Meta litigation, alleging its facial recognition software violated Texans’ privacy. This time, Bash was the co-lead counsel. Meta, which called the lawsuit meritless, settled the case for $1.4 billion in the summer of 2024. It was a windfall for Keller Postman. The firm billed $97 million, the largest fee charged by outside counsel under Paxton’s tenure. Bash’s work alone accounted for $3.6 million of that total. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Bash, a former U.S. Supreme Court clerk, said in a statement she is honored the attorney general’s office partnered with Keller Postman based on the firm’s “first-rate attorneys and extensive experience.” “We have a record of taking on the most significant litigation in the country against the most powerful defendants in the world,” Bash said. Keller Postman did not respond to a request for comment. There is little to stop Paxton, or any other occupant of his office, from handing these contracts out. The attorney general can award them without seeking bids from other law firms or asking anyone’s permission. Asked to provide competitive-bid documents for the contingent-fee contracts it has awarded, the attorney general’s office said it had none because state law “exempts the OAG from having to do all of the solicitation steps when hiring outside counsel.” Given the high-profile nature of representing an attorney general and the potential for a big payday, many qualified firms would be eager to compete for this work, said Paul Nolette, a professor of political science at Marquette University who studies attorneys general. “I’d be curious to know what the justification is for this not going on the open market,” Nolette said. Paxton declined interview requests for this story. He has publicly defended the practice of hiring outside law firms, arguing that his office lacks the resources in-house to take on massive corporations like tech companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers. “These parties have practically unlimited resources that would swamp most legal teams and delay effective enforcement,” Paxton told the Senate finance committee during a budget hearing in January. A spokesperson for Paxton said in a statement that the outside lawyers hired by the office are some of the best in the nation. With the contingent-fee settlements to date, more than $2 billion, the state “could not have gotten a better return on its investment,” the statement said. Chris Toth, former executive director of the National Association of Attorneys General, questioned why so much extra help is needed. Outside counsel is appropriate for small states, he said, that “only have so many lawyers with so many levels of expertise.” The Texas attorney general’s office, one of the largest in the country, has more than 700 attorneys. “Large states typically don’t hire outside counsel,” Toth said. “They should have the people in-house that should be able to go toe-to-toe with the best attorneys that are out there.” When a Texas attorney general previously made a practice of giving lucrative contracts to private counsel, it didn’t end well. Dan Morales was the last Democrat to hold the office. He became embroiled in scandal after he used outside firms to help secure a $17 billion settlement in Big Tobacco litigation in 1998. Republicans, including then-Gov. George W. Bush, blasted the $3.2 billion payout to the outside lawyers as exorbitant. Their attacks grew more intense when Morales sought to steer $500 million of that sum to a lawyer, a personal friend, who did very little work on the case. Morales pleaded guilty in 2003 to related federal corruption charges. He served 3 1/2 years behind bars. John Cornyn, the Republican who succeeded Morales in 1999, criticized his predecessor’s handling of the tobacco case during his campaign for the office. In an interview for this story, Cornyn said he never hired outside counsel as attorney general because he focused on recruiting talented in-house lawyers that he felt could handle all the office’s cases. Paxton is challenging Cornyn, now a four-term U.S. senator, in next year’s Republican primary. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, the Republican who led the office after Cornyn, appears to have rarely used private lawyers. The attorney general’s office was able to produce records for only part of Abbott’s 12-year term because state law allows the files to be deleted after so many years. The office signed nine outside counsel contracts between 2010 and 2014, all pro bono or for hourly rates rather than contingency. Abbott did not respond to an interview request. Paxton also seldom outsourced cases during his first five years in office. Through 2019, he awarded only nine outside counsel contracts, all pro bono or hourly rate. The most expensive contract capped fees at $500,000 — far less than $143 million the state paid to the two firms, including Bash’s, that handled the Meta case. He changed course in 2020. That summer, the attorney general’s office was gearing up to file its first case against Google. It related to allegations that the company monopolized the online advertising market, raising costs for advertisers, who increased the price of their products for average consumers as a result. Paxton initially had no plans to hire outside counsel for the litigation, three former deputy attorneys general told the Tribune and ProPublica. But before the case was filed, the attorney general’s office was thrown into upheaval. At the end of September, seven of Paxton’s senior advisers reported him to the FBI, concerned his relationship with an Austin real estate investor had crossed the line into bribery and corruption. State House members would later impeach Paxton on counts related to the accusations; state senators eventually acquitted him. The federal criminal investigation into Paxton did not result in any criminal charges. Over fall 2020, each of the lawyers in his office who had accused Paxton of wrongdoing quit or was fired. That included Darren McCarty, the head of civil litigation who was supposed to lead the Google litigation before he reported his boss to the FBI. He resigned on Oct. 26. Less than two months later, on Dec. 16, Paxton signed contracts with The Lanier Law Firm and Keller Postman to investigate Google. They filed the lawsuit against the tech giant in federal court the same day. Paxton replaced the lawyers who complained to the authorities. The staffing of the antitrust and consumer protection divisions, which would have handled these cases, remained constant at more than 80 employees in the following years. Yet Paxton continued to outsource lawsuits against large corporations to private lawyers. Under Keller Postman’s contract, the firm would be paid only if it secured a settlement or won at trial. These contingent-fee cases have the potential to be far more profitable for the outside firms than those in which they bill at a regular hourly rate. In a successful case, the contracts say that firms are paid either a percentage of a settlement or the sum of hours billed by the firm times four, whichever is less. In the Meta case, Keller Postman was entitled to 11% of the state’s settlement, a share that totaled $154 million. But because the firm’s fees and expenses totaled $97 million, it billed that sum. In multiple legislative sessions, Paxton has testified that outsourcing was the only way his office could stand toe-to-toe with corporate titans. If Paxton has a shortage of qualified in-house attorneys, Cornyn told the newsrooms, that’s because of the damage the whistleblower scandal did to the reputation of the attorney general’s office as a home for ambitious young lawyers. “He’s a victim of his own malfeasance and mismanagement because people did not want to work for him anymore,” Cornyn said. “And if you run off your best lawyers because you engage in questionable ethical conduct, then you’re left with very few options. But this shouldn’t be a way to reward bad behavior.” Former Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard said he was surprised Paxton began hiring contingent-fee outside lawyers only after the scandal, since those contracts, with their potential for high profits, are tougher to ethically defend. “I would have thought it would have been the other way around — that he got more careful after he got the whistle blown on him,” said Goddard, a Democrat. “But it looked like he got more reckless.” Paxton’s style of procurement also benefited Buzbee, the man who successfully defended him during his impeachment trial, which stemmed from allegations the whistleblowers raised. The attorney general chose to skip most of the proceedings, so for the 10 days of trial in the Texas Senate, his most vociferous advocate was the loquacious Buzbee. The pair sat side by side when the attorney general did attend. A little more than a year later, Paxton hired The Buzbee Law Firm to pursue an antitrust suit against the investment firms BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard that accuses the companies of manipulating the coal market in a way that allegedly increased electricity prices for Texans. The firms deny wrongdoing. Buzbee is a successful litigator and one of Houston’s most famous plaintiffs’ attorneys. Among other victories, he won settlements for victims of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and $73 million for Gulf of Mexico oil drillers in a 2001 antitrust case. But he’s known primarily for personal injury work, not antitrust litigation. His firm, one of two hired for this latest attorney general’s office contingent-fee case, could collect 10% of any judgment or settlement. The case is in its early stages, though the Trump administration in May filed a brief in the case in support of Texas. Buzbee downplayed the potential for a big payday in an email to the newsrooms and argued there is no buddy system at play, noting he believed other law firms also interviewed with Paxton’s office for the job. (The attorney general’s office did not confirm this.) He said his firm has to pay for significant expenses up front, without any guarantee of payment. “The current arrangement may be a good deal for other lawyers, but in all candor, it’s not for me,” Buzbee said, adding that his normal hourly rate is $2,250. “Frankly, the only reason I’m even doing it is that I am proud to represent the state in such a landmark case.” The connections between Paxton and the lawyers he has hired also extend to other firms. The attorney general’s office hired the firm Norton Rose Fulbright, one of the largest in the country with more than 3,000 lawyers on staff, to work on separate Google cases for the state, focusing on consumer protection allegations. The attorney general’s office has awarded three contracts to the firm since 2022 for cases against the tech giant. Three times during that period, Joseph Graham, the firm’s lead counsel on the Google litigation, contributed $5,000 to Paxton’s campaign for attorney general. Twice, the donations came within 16 days of Graham signing one of the firm’s contracts with the attorney general. The firm and its attorneys have contributed $39,500 to Paxton’s campaign since he took office. Neither Graham nor Norton Rose Fulbright responded to requests for comment. Mark Lanier, founder of The Lanier Law Firm, which the state hired to work on a separate Google case, is a large donor to Texas elected officials. He has contributed $31,000 to Paxton’s campaigns since 2015. The largest contribution, for $25,000, came six months after Lanier signed his firm’s Google contract. The Lanier contract is slightly different from the others the attorney general’s office awarded, in that the firm’s payment is partially based on a basic hourly rate but it could also be paid more if it wins the case, as in the contingent-fee model. Lanier noted in an emailed statement to the newsrooms that he took a reduced fee on this case and maintained that the attorney general’s office needed the kind of firepower his team can bring against an opponent like Google. “The Texas AG office and its lawyers are good, but specialists are needed in a war like this. And it is a war,” Lanier wrote. “It would be irresponsible to pursue Google on behalf of Texans without bring[ing] the fullest resources you can.” A competitive, open process for awarding contracts can be a strong defense against accusations of favoritism, Goddard said. Unlike some other states, Texas does not require these contracts be put out to competitive bid. Florida, for example, has one of the most robust laws in the country for procuring outside counsel, requiring the attorney general to explain in writing why a contingent-fee contract is necessary. It also mandates most contracts be put out to competitive bid and caps contingent-fee payouts at $50 million. Texas has no such cap. It also has virtually no method for state lawmakers to truly supervise this kind of practice. State law mandates only that the attorney general notify the Legislature when his office awards a contingent-fee contract, and certify that no in-house lawyers or private attorneys at an hourly rate can handle the task. Paxton has done so in boilerplate two-page letters that all say outside attorneys are needed because of the “scope and enormity” of the cases. If lawmakers are concerned about these contracts, there is no mechanism for them to challenge Paxton’s determination that private counsel is needed. Having lawyers bid for work would eliminate the appearance of impropriety that hangs over Paxton’s hires, Goddard said. “A couple look like paybacks, which is extraordinarily improper, in other words to award a contract to someone who’s a major contributor or has recently left your office,” he said. “All of those would not be allowed in our state.” Officials in other states have said they can still secure big wins for their constituents without relying on private firms. California, for example, reached a $93 million settlement with Google in 2023 over claims that the company was clandestinely tracking users’ locations. A year earlier, in a case with similar allegations, Oregon and Nebraska led a 40-state coalition that won a $392 million settlement against the company. Texas was not part of this suit. The latter agreement required Google to make new privacy disclosures to consumers, restricted its ability to share users’ location information with advertisers and required the company to prepare an annual report detailing how it was complying with the settlement terms. Doug Peterson, the Republican attorney general of Nebraska at the time, said negotiating the financial penalty — Nebraska’s share was $11.9 million — was a secondary goal of the settlement. “The most important thing we’re trying to do is to stop the bad behavior,” Peterson said. McCarty, one of the attorney general employees who blew the whistle on Paxton, said private lawyers can be talented, but they have an incentive to fixate on the financial portion of settlements — which is tied to their compensation — rather than enforcement provisions that may best protect a state’s residents. “Government enforcers, especially in the antitrust context, can focus on more effective solutions,” McCarty said. Norton Rose Fulbright has yet to send its final billing records to the attorney general’s office but is likely to be rewarded handsomely. The firm helped the state secure a $1.38 billion settlement with Google in May. Google spokesperson José Castañeda said the Texas settlement, which has not been finalized, will contain no new restrictions on the company’s practices. Under the terms of its contracts, the firm’s fees could exceed $350 million.

Title: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton Is Outsourcing More of His Office’s Work to Costly Private Lawyers

Despite having an office with hundreds of attorneys, Ken Paxton frequently opts to hire private lawyers. One cost taxpayers more than $24,000 in one day. This article is co-published with ProPublica, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for ProPublica’s Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox as soon as they are published. Also, sign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. One day in late May 2024, lawyer Zina Bash spent 6 1/2 hours working on a case against Facebook parent company Meta on behalf of the state of Texas. She reviewed draft legal filings. She participated in a court-ordered mediation session and then discussed the outcome with state Attorney General Ken Paxton. In her previous job as senior counsel on Paxton’s leadership team, that labor would have cost Texas taxpayers $641. But Bash had moved to private practice. Paxton hired her firm to work on the Meta case, allowing her to bill $3,780 an hour, so that day of work will cost taxpayers $24,570. In the past five years, Paxton has grown increasingly reliant on pricey private lawyers to argue cases on behalf of the state, rather than the hundreds of attorneys who work within his office, an investigation by The Texas Tribune and ProPublica found. These are often attorneys, like Bash, with whom Paxton has personal or political ties. In addition to Bash, one such contract went to Tony Buzbee, the trial lawyer who successfully defended Paxton during his 2023 impeachment trial on corruption charges. Three other contracts went to firms whose senior attorneys have donated to Paxton’s political campaigns. Despite these connections and what experts say are potential conflicts of interest, Paxton does not appear to have recused himself from the selection process. Although he is not required to by law, this raises a concern about appearing improper, experts who study attorneys general said. Paxton appears to have also outsourced cases more frequently than his predecessors, available records show. And he’s inked the kind of contingent-fee contracts, in which firms receive a share of a settlement if they win, far more often than the attorneys general in other large states, including California, New York and Pennsylvania. Since 2015, the New York and California attorneys general have awarded zero contingent-fee contracts; Pennsylvania’s has signed one. During that period, Paxton’s office approved 13. One of those was with Bash’s firm, Chicago-based Keller Postman, at the time known as Keller Lenkner, which she joined as partner in February 2021 after resigning from her job at the attorney general’s office. Paxton had signed a contract with the company two months earlier to investigate Google for deceptive business practices and violations of antitrust law. A little more than a year later, Bash’s firm won a state contract to work on the Meta litigation, alleging its facial recognition software violated Texans’ privacy. This time, Bash was the co-lead counsel. Meta, which called the lawsuit meritless, settled the case for $1.4 billion in the summer of 2024. It was a windfall for Keller Postman. The firm billed $97 million, the largest fee charged by outside counsel under Paxton’s tenure. Bash’s work alone accounted for $3.6 million of that total. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Bash, a former U.S. Supreme Court clerk, said in a statement she is honored the attorney general’s office partnered with Keller Postman based on the firm’s “first-rate attorneys and extensive experience.” “We have a record of taking on the most significant litigation in the country against the most powerful defendants in the world,” Bash said. Keller Postman did not respond to a request for comment. There is little to stop Paxton, or any other occupant of his office, from handing these contracts out. The attorney general can award them without seeking bids from other law firms or asking anyone’s permission. Asked to provide competitive-bid documents for the contingent-fee contracts it has awarded, the attorney general’s office said it had none because state law “exempts the OAG from having to do all of the solicitation steps when hiring outside counsel.” Given the high-profile nature of representing an attorney general and the potential for a big payday, many qualified firms would be eager to compete for this work, said Paul Nolette, a professor of political science at Marquette University who studies attorneys general. “I’d be curious to know what the justification is for this not going on the open market,” Nolette said. Paxton declined interview requests for this story. He has publicly defended the practice of hiring outside law firms, arguing that his office lacks the resources in-house to take on massive corporations like tech companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers. “These parties have practically unlimited resources that would swamp most legal teams and delay effective enforcement,” Paxton told the Senate finance committee during a budget hearing in January. A spokesperson for Paxton said in a statement that the outside lawyers hired by the office are some of the best in the nation. With the contingent-fee settlements to date, more than $2 billion, the state “could not have gotten a better return on its investment,” the statement said. Chris Toth, former executive director of the National Association of Attorneys General, questioned why so much extra help is needed. Outside counsel is appropriate for small states, he said, that “only have so many lawyers with so many levels of expertise.” The Texas attorney general’s office, one of the largest in the country, has more than 700 attorneys. “Large states typically don’t hire outside counsel,” Toth said. “They should have the people in-house that should be able to go toe-to-toe with the best attorneys that are out there.” When a Texas attorney general previously made a practice of giving lucrative contracts to private counsel, it didn’t end well. Dan Morales was the last Democrat to hold the office. He became embroiled in scandal after he used outside firms to help secure a $17 billion settlement in Big Tobacco litigation in 1998. Republicans, including then-Gov. George W. Bush, blasted the $3.2 billion payout to the outside lawyers as exorbitant. Their attacks grew more intense when Morales sought to steer $500 million of that sum to a lawyer, a personal friend, who did very little work on the case. Morales pleaded guilty in 2003 to related federal corruption charges. He served 3 1/2 years behind bars. John Cornyn, the Republican who succeeded Morales in 1999, criticized his predecessor’s handling of the tobacco case during his campaign for the office. In an interview for this story, Cornyn said he never hired outside counsel as attorney general because he focused on recruiting talented in-house lawyers that he felt could handle all the office’s cases. Paxton is challenging Cornyn, now a four-term U.S. senator, in next year’s Republican primary. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, the Republican who led the office after Cornyn, appears to have rarely used private lawyers. The attorney general’s office was able to produce records for only part of Abbott’s 12-year term because state law allows the files to be deleted after so many years. The office signed nine outside counsel contracts between 2010 and 2014, all pro bono or for hourly rates rather than contingency. Abbott did not respond to an interview request. Paxton also seldom outsourced cases during his first five years in office. Through 2019, he awarded only nine outside counsel contracts, all pro bono or hourly rate. The most expensive contract capped fees at $500,000 — far less than $143 million the state paid to the two firms, including Bash’s, that handled the Meta case. He changed course in 2020. That summer, the attorney general’s office was gearing up to file its first case against Google. It related to allegations that the company monopolized the online advertising market, raising costs for advertisers, who increased the price of their products for average consumers as a result. Paxton initially had no plans to hire outside counsel for the litigation, three former deputy attorneys general told the Tribune and ProPublica. But before the case was filed, the attorney general’s office was thrown into upheaval. At the end of September, seven of Paxton’s senior advisers reported him to the FBI, concerned his relationship with an Austin real estate investor had crossed the line into bribery and corruption. State House members would later impeach Paxton on counts related to the accusations; state senators eventually acquitted him. The federal criminal investigation into Paxton did not result in any criminal charges. Over fall 2020, each of the lawyers in his office who had accused Paxton of wrongdoing quit or was fired. That included Darren McCarty, the head of civil litigation who was supposed to lead the Google litigation before he reported his boss to the FBI. He resigned on Oct. 26. Less than two months later, on Dec. 16, Paxton signed contracts with The Lanier Law Firm and Keller Postman to investigate Google. They filed the lawsuit against the tech giant in federal court the same day. Paxton replaced the lawyers who complained to the authorities. The staffing of the antitrust and consumer protection divisions, which would have handled these cases, remained constant at more than 80 employees in the following years.

Title: Goldman Sachs, BNY Bring $7 Trillion Money Market to Blockchain

The announcement comes just days after President Trump signed a law that introduces US-regulated stablecoins. Sean Craig sean.craig@thedailyupside.com For all the sci-fi promises about blockchain transforming finance, the reality will be more mundane as thousands of ordinary instruments quietly move to digital ledgers. On Wednesday, it was money market funds. Goldman Sachs and the Bank of New York (BNY) announced they’re allowing institutional investors to buy digitized tokens that mirror shares in the funds, making a $7 trillion industry in which liquidity is a key selling point even more liquid. Money market funds, if you’re new here, are a type of mutual fund that invests in things that are very liquid and very short-term. That means the most liquid thing of all, cash, as well as cash equivalents like commercial paper. When these funds invest in debt, it’s highly rated and comes with a short-term maturity, like US Treasurys or repo agreements. This makes them a relatively safe place to park cash in times of volatility, but the tradeoff for low risk and ability to quickly redeem your money is lower dividends when compared with more aggressive or longer-term investments. There has, of course, been no shortage of volatile times in recent years. The Federal Reserve hiking interest rates in 2022 and the investor games of inflation-watch and tariff-watch that have since followed drew some $2.5 trillion into money market funds, helping swell the industry to $7 trillion. Wall Street’s latest blockchain integration goes beyond simply digitizing traditional finance. The real innovation lies in creating digital tokens that mirror money market fund shares, a move that could fundamentally change how these instruments work: Several of the biggest funds in finance — BlackRock, Fidelity, Federated Hermes — have signed up to participate in the launch, with BNY and Goldman’s asset management units joining as well. Token Mention: The announcement comes just days after President Trump signed a law that introduces US-regulated stablecoins. Retail giants Walmart and Amazon, as well as Wall Street titans JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America, have all signaled that they’re exploring the stablecoin space, which involves digital tokens typically pegged to the US dollar that can be used for transactions. The money market fund token, by contrast, pays a yield and acts as an investment; both cases are indicative of how blockchain is increasingly going to play a role in every aspect of finance. Block’s membership in the index comes as it transitions into an all-in-one finance platform that offers debit cards and loans to clients. The timing of Strategy’s latest Bitcoin gains was hardly a surprise: last week also marked “Crypto Week” on Capitol Hill. Berlin-based economist Jan Philipp Fritsche explains how the new NATO defense spending pledge and US crypto legislation could impact the EU. Goldman’s top line metrics — profit up 22% to $3.7 billion and total revenues up 15% to $14.6 billion — also bested analysts’ expectations. In the past 30 days, Ethereum treasury companies scooped up more than 545,000 ether worth at least $1.6 billion, CoinTelegraph reported. The consensus takeaway from the earnings season so far is that the economy is, in spite of everything, doing pretty good. The new rules could let homebuyers keep their crypto and use it to qualify for loans though mainstream banks. The big US banks bested Q1 earnings expectations, and many observers expect big boosts to their Q2 trading desk revenues. Nothing to boost an asset class like the most powerful legislative body in the world holding a week in your honor. The dollar is the most important currency on earth, adding up to 57.7% of global currency reserves in the first quarter. The bank downgraded JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America, citing a classic case of macroeconomic uncertainty. The TINA trade has hit some snags in recent years, with bonds looking like a pretty swell alternative in an era of high interest rates. © 2025 The Daily Upside

President Donald Trump participates in the Inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit at Cohon University Center at Carnegie Mellon University on July 15, in Pittsburgh, Penn. Photo by The White House/Wikimedia Commons (Public domain) This story was originally published by Wired and appears here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration AI IS “NOT my thing,” President Donald Trump admitted during a speech in Pittsburgh on Tuesday. However, the president said during his remarks at the Energy and Innovation Summit, his advisers had told him just how important energy was to the future of AI. “You need double the electric of what we have right now, and maybe even more than that,” Trump said, recalling a conversation with “David”—most likely White House AI czar David Sacks, a panelist at the summit. “I said, what, are you kidding? That's double the electric that we have. Take everything we have and double it.” At the high-profile summit on Tuesday — where, in addition to Sacks, panelists and attendees included Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Google president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat and ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods — companies announced $92 billion in investments across various energy and AI-related ventures. These are just the latest in recent breakneck rollouts in investment around AI and energy infrastructure. A day before the Pittsburgh meeting, Mark Zuckerberg shared on Threads that Meta would be building “titan clusters” of data centers to supercharge its AI efforts. The one closest to coming online, dubbed Prometheus, is located in Ohio and will be powered by onsite gas generation, SemiAnalysis reported last week. For an administration committed to advancing the future of fossil fuels, the location of the event was significant. Pennsylvania sits on the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, which supercharged Pennsylvania’s fracking boom in the late 2000s and early 2010s. The state is still the country’s second-most prolific natural gas producer. Pennsylvania-based natural gas had a big role at the summit: The CEO of Pittsburgh-based natural gas company EQT, Toby Rice — who dubs himself the “people’s champion of natural gas” — moderated one of the panels and sat onstage with the president during his speech. All this new demand from AI is welcome news for the natural gas industry in the US, the world’s top producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. Global gas markets have been facing a mounting supply glut for years. Following a warm winter last year, Morgan Stanley predicted gas supply could reach “multi-decade highs” over the next few years. A jolt of new demand — like the demand represented by massive data centers — could revitalize the industry and help drive prices back up. Natural gas from Pennsylvania and the Appalachian region, in particular, has faced market challenges both from ultra-cheap natural gas from the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico as well as a lack of infrastructure to carry supply out of the region. These economic headwinds are “why the industry is doing their best to sort of create this drumbeat or this narrative around the need for AI data centers,” says Clark Williams-Derry, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. It appears to be working. Pipeline companies are already pitching new projects to truck gas from the northeast — responding, they say, to data center demand. The industry is finding a willing partner in the Trump administration. Since taking office, Trump has used AI as a lever to open up opportunities for fossil fuels, including a well-publicized effort to resuscitate coal in the name of more computing power. The summit, which was organized by Republican senator (and former hedge fund CEO) Dave McCormick, clearly reflected the administration’s priorities in this regard: No representatives from any wind or solar companies were present on any of the public panels. Tech companies, which have expressed an interest in using any and all cheap power available for AI and have quietly pushed back against some of the administration’s anti-renewables positions, aren’t necessarily on the same page as the Trump administration. Among the announcements made at the summit was a $3 billion investment in hydropower from Google. This demand isn’t necessarily driven by a big concern for the climate — many tech giants have walked back their climate commitments in recent years as their focus on AI has sharpened — but rather pure economics. Financial analyst Lazard said last month that installing utility-scale solar panels and batteries is still cheaper than building out natural gas plants, even without tax incentives. Gas infrastructure is also facing a global shortage that makes the timescales for setting up power generation vastly different. “The waiting list for a new turbine is five years,” Williams-Derry says. “If you want a new solar plant, you call China, you say, ‘I want more solar.’” Given the ideological split at the summit, things occasionally got a little awkward. On one panel, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, who headed up a fracking company before coming to the federal government, talked at length about how the Obama and Biden administrations were on an “energy crazy train,” scoffing at those administrations’ support for wind and solar. Speaking directly after Wright, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink admitted that solar would likely support dispatchable gas in powering AI. Incredibly, fellow panel member Woods, the ExxonMobil CEO, later paid some of the only lip service to the idea of drawing down emissions heard during the entire event. (Woods was touting the oil giant’s carbon capture and storage business.) Still, the hype train, for the most part, moved smoothly, with everyone agreeing on one thing: We’re going to need a lot of power, and soon. Blackstone CEO Jonathan Gray said that AI could help drive “40 or 50 percent more power usage over the next decade,” while Porat, of Google, mentioned some economists’ projections that AI could add $4 trillion to the US economy by 2030. It’s easy to find any variety of headlines or reports—often based on projections produced by private companies—projecting massive growth numbers for AI. “I view all of these projections with great skepticism,” says Jonathan Koomey, a computing researcher and consultant who has contributed to research around AI and power. “I don't think anyone has any idea, even a few years hence, how much electricity data centers are gonna use.” In February, Koomey coauthored a report for the Bipartisan Policy Center cautioning that improvements in AI efficiency and other developments in the technology make data center power load hard to predict. But there’s “a bunch of self-interested actors,” Koomey says, involved in the hype cycle around AI and power, including energy executives, utilities, consultants and AI companies. Koomey remembers the last time there was a hype bubble around electricity, fossil fuels and technology. In the late 1990s, a variety of sources, including investment banks, trade publications and experts testifying in front of Congress, began to spread hype around the growth of the internet, claiming that the internet could soon consume as much as half of US electricity. More coal-fired power, many of these sources argued, would be needed to support this massive expansion. (“Dig More Coal—The PCs Are Coming” was the headline of a 1999 Forbes article that Koomey cites as being particularly influential to shaping the hype.) The prediction never came to pass, as efficiency gains in tech helped drive down the internet’s energy needs; the initial projections were also based, Koomey says, on a variety of faulty calculations. Koomey says that he sees parallels between the late 1990s and the current craze around AI and energy. “People just need to understand the history and not fall for these self-interested narratives,” he says. There’s some signs that the AI-energy bubble may not be inflating as much as Big Tech thinks: in March, Microsoft quietly backed out of 2GW of data center leases, citing a decision to not support some training workloads from OpenAI. “It can both be true that there's growth in electricity use and there's a whole bunch of people hyping it way beyond what is likely to happen,” Koomey says. Geoffrey Pounder | July 24th 2025, 06:19 am Headline: "Trump and the energy industry are eager to power AI with fossil fuels" Make that: "Trump and the fossil-fuel industry are eager to power AI with fossil fuels" It's wrong, misleading, and unhelpful to conflate the energy industry with fossil fuels. As if they are one and the same. The energy industry increasingly includes renewables like solar and wind. Other energy sources include hydro, nuclear, biofuels, etc. The fossil-fuel industry routinely conflates the two. They are not synonymous. Let's help ourselves, not the fossil-fuel industry.

Business FILE PHOTO: Shoppers browse a Walmart Supercenter a day after U.S. President Donald Trump announced new tariffs, in Secaucus, New Jersey, U.S. April 3, 2025. REUTERS/Siddharth Cavale/File Photo NEW YORK :Walmart unveiled plans on Thursday to roll out a suite of AI-powered "super agents" designed to improve the shopping experience for customers and streamline operations. The world's largest retailer said the four agents powered by agentic AI - designed for Walmart shoppers, store employees, suppliers and sellers, and software developers - would soon be the primary way people engage with Walmart. The super agents will be the entry point for every AI interaction these groups have with Walmart, replacing several existing agents and AI tools, along with new ones yet to be built, the company said. Walmart is betting on AI to drive its e-commerce growth, aiming for online sales to account for 50 per cent of its total sales within five years. The company reported annual sales of $648 billion last year. By harnessing AI to streamline the shopping process - from discovering new products and helping with returns to improving delivery speeds - the retailer hopes it can attract more shoppers away from Amazon, which has also introduced a range of AI-powered tools for sellers and shoppers.

Loading Walmart's push comes as the short-term financial payoff of AI remains uncertain and concerns over how it might affect jobs across the industry.One of the agents, Sparky, is already available for shoppers on Walmart's app as a Gen-AI powered tool. Currently it assists customers with getting product suggestions for an athletic activity, finding the right ink for their printer, or summarizing product reviews, among other options.In its "super agent" form it will be able to reorder items, plan an event such as a "unicorn-themed party" and through computer vision be able to offer product recipes by just looking at the contents of a shopper's fridge, Hari Vasudev, Walmart's U.S. chief technology officer, said at an event in New York. Agentic AI is the next iteration of generative AI, in that it needs minimal human intervention to make decisions and achieve specific tasks.Walmart is also developing an "Associate" super agent, to be rolled out in the coming months, which will allow workers and corporate staff to do things such as submit an application for parental leave or give store managers immediate information on sales data for a certain category or a product with minimal input. Employees now use separate AI tools to handle those queries, a company spokesperson said. For sellers, suppliers, and advertisers, Walmart is developing a super agent called "Marty" to streamline the onboarding process, manage orders and create ad campaigns. It is also working on a "Developer" super agent, which will be the platform on which all future AI tools will be tested, built, and launched, the company said. "Agents can help automate and simplify pretty much everything that we do," Suresh Kumar, Walmart's chief technology officer said. He added that the company chose to launch these super agents now because "customers are ready, they are using AI in pretty much everything they do."The company declined to say whether the super agents would replace jobs. Dave Glick, senior vice president of enterprise business systems, said it would create new jobs without elaborating further. On Wednesday, Walmart had two AI-related announcements: it hired former Instacart executive Daniel Danker as executive vice president (EVP) for AI acceleration, product and design and created a new EVP, AI role that is yet to be filled.While retail has largely avoided AI-related layoffs, the tech industry has been hit hard, even in a historically strong market and resilient economy. In June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said generative AI and agents will reduce its total corporate workforce over the next few years. Microsoft has emphasized that AI will boost productivity, but it has laid off thousands of employees, while Google has laid off hundreds of employees. Walmart has not linked any job cuts directly to AI, but it has been downsizing its corporate staff and is modernizing e-commerce fulfillment centers with automation, resulting in some workforce reductions.

Title: The Rise of Tokenisation: Stablecoins, big banks & the road ahead

Tokenisation has been a buzzword among crypto enthusiasts for years, promising to transform financial markets by moving assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate onto the blockchain. While regulatory support is growing, progress has been slower than expected. (Source: Reuters) Under President Trump’s administration, new laws have relaxed regulations around crypto. This has opened doors for faster development of tokenised financial assets and increased investor interest in the sector. Tokenisation involves converting traditional financial assets into blockchain-based tokens. These tokens represent the original asset and can be stored in crypto wallets or traded on blockchain platforms, just like cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins are tokenised versions of fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. They’re pegged 1:1 with real assets and allow cross-border transfers outside traditional banking. While they face criticism for enabling illicit finance, they also serve populations with weak financial infrastructure. Stablecoins are booming, with the market worth around $256 billion and projected to reach $2 trillion by 2028. However, tokenised stocks, bonds, and other assets still lack scale and secondary market liquidity. Despite years of hype, tokenised assets face hurdles. Many banks are developing private blockchains that aren’t interoperable, limiting trading. Without public secondary markets, these tokens remain stuck in early-stage trials. Proponents say tokenisation improves liquidity for hard-to-trade assets like real estate and lowers entry barriers for retail investors. It could create fractional ownership opportunities and democratize access to complex asset classes. Major institutions like Bank of America, Citi, and BlackRock are exploring tokenisation. Coinbase is seeking approval to offer tokenised equities, signalling growing institutional confidence in this space. New U.S. laws such as the Clarity Act aim to provide a defined legal framework for stablecoins and other tokens. These rules are expected to boost adoption and reduce legal uncertainty around tokenised assets. Despite optimism, risks remain. Critics warn of potential systemic vulnerabilities, especially without audits and strong oversight. The ECB has flagged stablecoins as threats to financial stability, and regulators insist that tokenised securities must still comply with existing laws.

Title: Retail Investors Want In—Just As Private Equity Industry Resets
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/carriemccabe/2025/07/24/retail-investors-want-in-just-as-private-equity-industry-resets/

ByCarrie McCabe ByCarrie McCabe, Contributor. Private Equity Retail investors are increasingly eager to access private equity (“PE”), drawn by the promise of higher returns and diversification. With public markets dominated by a narrow set of tech-driven mega-cap stocks, the appeal of uncorrelated, long-term private market exposure is growing. According to the American Investment Council’s 2025 public pension study, whose members consist of private equity and growth capital firms, private equity delivered a median annualized return of 13.5% over the 10-year period ending in 2024. It was also the best-performing asset class in public pension portfolios—outpacing public equity, real estate, and fixed income. To date, retail investors have had limited access to burgeoning private assets, an immense marketplace. Private assets, including PE, have tripled in size since 2013 and are projected to reach $65 trillion globally by 2034, according to Bain. And more than 1,500 global startups now carry unicorn valuations, as companies stay private longer. Retail interest is being reinforced by a shift in policy. Congress is weighing legislation to allow defined contribution retirement plans—including 401(k)s—to access private equity. A new executive order is expected to clarify fiduciary protections for plan sponsors, particularly around fees and valuation concerns. However, retail’s arrival comes just as the private equity model is undergoing a profound transition. For much of the past decade, PE thrived on cheap debt, rising valuations, and global dealmaking. That model is under pressure. “Performance levers that were pulled to such great effect during the low-rate era—principally financial leverage and valuation expansion—will lose potency,” notes Future Standard in their recent private markets outlook. Rather today, with borrowing costs higher and valuations compressed, managers must create value through margin expansion, pricing power, and operational efficiency. Meanwhile, the macro backdrop isn’t helping. Current US policies have clouded the M&A environment, where valuation is often negatively correlated to volatility. And timely exits, which underpin PE’s return profile, are becoming harder to achieve. Distributions as a share of net asset value have fallen to just 11%—the lowest in over a decade. And PitchBook estimates there are over 12,000 U.S. PE-backed companies in inventory—enough to last seven or eight years at the current exit pace. Even elite investors are adjusting to this new PE environment. Yale University, long an advocate of PE, is reportedly seeking to sell up to $6 billion in private equity holdings to manage liquidity constraints. As institutional fundraising slows, Wall Street is turning to retail. BlackRock recently launched a target-date fund including private equity and credit, backed by $30 billion in acquisitions to expand its private markets platforms. Certainly, private equity remains a powerful investment engine, but it’s evolving. While institutional investors are equipped to navigate illiquidity, fees, and valuation opacity, the average retail investor may not be. Products reaching individual investors often lack the access or pricing advantages of large institutions. Layered fees—across platforms, managers, and structures—can severely dilute returns. In a lower-return environment, that friction matters more. Successful retail participation will depend on access via sophisticated fiduciary advisors—those bound to act in a client’s best interest and capable of navigating complexity. Policy may soon open the doors wider, but access is not the same as advantage. For retail investors, the PE opportunity is real—but so is the challenge to enter wisely.

ByIan Sayson ByIan Sayson, Forbes Staff. Aboitiz InfraCapital owns and operates the Mactan-Cebu International Airport. BlackRock will buy 40% of Aboitiz Equity Ventures’ privately held infrastructure unit, bolstering Aboitiz InfraCapital’s financial muscle as it steps up spending to modernize the country’s infrastructure. Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), BlackRock’s wholly owned unit, and Aboitiz Equity are in “the process of finalizing a strategic partnership,” the Philippine conglomerate said in a statement, without disclosing the amount of the potential sale. GIP, which was acquired by BlackRock in October, has over $183 billion in assets under management. It has interests in energy, transport, digital infrastructure, water utility and waste management sectors. “The Philippines has compelling growth prospects, which can be further enhanced by developing world-class infrastructure,” Bayo Ogunlesi, chairman and CEO of GIP, said. “We are pleased to have the opportunity to become a strategic partner of the Aboitiz Group.” The Philippine government aims to double infrastructure spending to at least 2 trillion pesos ($35 billion) by 2028 from 1 trillion this year as it accelerates projects such as the 33-kilometer Metro Manila subway that’s estimated to cost 489 billion pesos to build. Aboitiz Equity—the publicly traded holding company of tycoon Sabin Aboitiz and his family—has been scaling up its infrastructure investments in recent years. It has interests in airports, power plants, industrial estates, telecommunications towers and water utilities. Shares of Aboitiz Equity gained 2.3% in late afternoon trading in Manila. “We are honored to explore this opportunity with Global Infrastructure Partners,” Sabin Aboitiz, CEO and president of the conglomerate said. “Together, we aim to deliver projects that improve lives and empower communities.” Aboitiz InfraCapital swung to a 207 million loss in the first quarter even as sales jumped 53% to 2.4 billion pesos amid soaring finance charges on the company’s mounting debt levels. Its total borrowings almost tripled to 45.3 billion pesos as of end-2024 from a year ago. Aside from infrastructure, Aboitiz Equity has interests in banking, financial services, food manufacturing, and real estate. With an estimated net worth of $2.2 billion, the Aboitiz family is among the wealthiest in the Philippines.

Therefore, as a result of the Funds' exposure to the values of JPM, the Funds may also be subject to the following risks: Underlying Securities Trading Risk. The trading prices of JPM may be highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors. Underlying Securities Performance Risk. JPM may fail to meet publicly announced guidelines or other expectations about its business, which could cause its share price to decline. Financial Services Industry Risk (JPX). The financial services industry can be significantly affected by regulatory changes, economic conditions, interest rate fluctuations, and competitive pressures. Derivatives Risks. The Funds' derivative investments carry risks such as an imperfect match between the derivative's performance and its underlying assets, and the potential for loss of principal, which can exceed the initial investment. Swap Agreements. The use of swap transactions is a highly specialized activity, which involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. Leverage Risk. As part of the Funds' principal investment strategy, the Funds will make investments in swap contracts and options. These derivative instruments provide the economic effect of financial leverage by creating additional investment exposure to the Underlying Securities, as well as the potential for greater loss. Compounding Risk. The Funds have a single day investment objective, and performance for any other period is the result of compounding daily returns for each trading day. The effects of compounding will likely cause the performance of a Fund to be either greater than or less than the Underlying Security's performance times the stated multiple in the Fund's investment objective, before accounting for fees and fund expenses. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Funds' expenses and reduce performance. Frequent trading may also cause adverse tax consequences for investors in the Funds due to an increase in short-term capital gains. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Funds are non-diversified, they may invest a greater percentage of their assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if they were diversified funds. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk of the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security, may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Additionally, the Fund will seek to employ its investment strategy as it relates to the underlying issuer regardless of whether there are significant corporate actions such as restructurings, enforcement activity, or acquisitions or periods adverse market, economic, or other conditions and will not seek to take temporary defensive positions during such periods. New Fund Risk. As newly formed funds, they have no operating history, providing a limited basis for investors to assess performance or management. Brokerage commissions may be charged on trades.

Title: Alphabet boosted by AI, cloud demand as spending needs skyrocket
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/07/24/alphabet-boosted-by-ai-cloud-demand-as-spending-needs-skyrocket/
Time Published: 2025-07-24T06:32:31Z
Full Content:
Alphabet said demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products boosted quarterly sales, and now requires an extreme increase in capital spending – heightening pressure on the company to justify the cost of keeping up in the AI race. Google’s parent company said 2025 capital expenditures will be $85 billion (€72 billion), or $10 billion greater than an earlier forecast. Although Alphabet beat expectations for second-quarter revenue and profit, its stock initially sank in after-hours trading, then rebounded after chief executive Sundar Pichai explained that the investments are necessary in order to keep up with customer needs. “Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand from cloud customers,” he said on a call Wednesday following the report. As Microsoft, start-up OpenAI, Meta Platforms and others continue to pour money into AI, Alphabet has little choice but to follow suit, analysts said. The race is particularly urgent for Google: competitors are building chatbots that may eventually appeal to consumers more than its flagship search product. “Google’s hand is forced by OpenAI to spend tremendously on AI’s infrastructure and applications,” said Nikhil Lai, an analyst at Forrester. The recent quarter was strong almost across the board for Alphabet. Sales, excluding partner payouts, climbed to $81.7 billion, Alphabet said in a statement, topping analysts’ projections of $79.6 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Alphabet is counting on its core search advertising juggernaut and growing cloud computing business to support its spiralling spending on AI. Employees are under pressure to bring AI products to market faster, from new modes of search to tools for cloud customers. “We are seeing significant demand for our comprehensive AI product portfolio,” Pichai said. Chief financial officer Anat Ashkenazi said capital expenditures will rise yet again next year, without providing details. The strain of the AI race could be spotted elsewhere in the company’s results. Ashkenazi attributed the company’s 16% jump in spending on research and development to increases in pay packages for key employees. Meta has been making unprecedented compensation offers as it seeks to woo researchers for its superintelligence lab, driving up the price for key employees across the industry. Earlier this month, Google struck a deal to pay about $2.4 billion for top talent and licensing rights from artificial intelligence coding start-up Windsurf. Yet money isn’t the only consideration for researchers when deciding where to work, Pichai said. Top talent in the field want “to really be at the frontier driving progress,” in addition to craving access to computing power and talented peers, Pichai said. “It’s a combination of all of that and using it to drive impact. And I think we are pretty competitive on all those fronts.” Google’s cloud-computing unit reported quarterly revenue of $13.6 billion and operating income of $2.83 billion, topping analysts’ projections. Google remains in third place in this market, after Microsoft and Amazon, but the company’s prowess in AI has helped it score client wins. The unit is widely viewed as Alphabet’s strongest source of growth as the main search business matures. The centrepiece of the cloud offensive is Gemini, the AI model that Google is rapidly weaving across its vast product portfolio, and pushing to enterprise clients. Many AI experts were impressed by the release of a new version of the Gemini model earlier this year, but it still trails OpenAI’s ChatGPT in adoption by most estimates. As Google faces mounting competition, it’s also facing penalties for being dominant. Google’s primary businesses are under threat of a break-up after US federal judges ruled that the company is maintaining illegal monopolies in search and some ad technology. Next month, Judge Amit Mehta is expected to deliver an order on the measures Google must take to restore competition in online search, though Google has said it plans to appeal the ruling. YouTube, Google’s video site, posted $9.8 billion in second-quarter ad revenue, exceeding analysts’ estimates of $9.56 billion. The unit, which draws most of its revenue from advertising, was expected to perform well thanks to its lead in livingroom streaming and heavy investments in podcasts. Alphabet’s Other Bets, a collection of futuristic businesses that includes the self-driving car effort Waymo, generated $373 million in revenue, missing estimates for $429.1 million. Ashkenazi said Alphabet will continue devoting more resources to Waymo. Alphabet has been aggressively expanding the operations of Waymo, which may soon face increased competition as Tesla ramps up its robotaxi business. Earlier this month, Waymo more than doubled its service area in Austin, Tesla’s home base, and said it would start collecting data in New York City in pursuit of a permit for testing. “The team is testing across more than 10 cities this year, including New York and Philadelphia,” Pichai said. “We hope to serve riders in all 10 in the future.” Google isn’t alone in feeling pressure to show success from AI investment. Shortly after Pichai’s Waymo comments, on the Tesla earnings call, chief executive Elon Musk started slamming Google’s AI prowess. He said Tesla was “actually much better than Google.” Investors might disagree; Tesla’s shares fell. – Bloomberg Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Goldman Sachs Partners With BNY Mellon To Bring $7 Trillion Money Market To Crypto
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/goldman-sachs-bny-mellon-to-7-trillion-money-crypto/
Time Published: 2025-07-24T05:00:09Z
Full Content:
The growing intersection between traditional finance and digital asset infrastructure has taken another step forward, as Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon announced a joint initiative aimed at integrating blockchain technology into the money market fund (MMF) ecosystem. The collaboration will see BNY Mellon leverage Goldman Sachs’ GS DAP® (also known as its private blockchain) to maintain a mirrored tokenized record of customer ownership in select MMFs. This marks the first instance in the United States where mirrored tokenization will be used to reflect ownership in MMFs through a blockchain-based ledger. The rollout includes major asset managers such as BlackRock, BNY Mellon Investment Management’s Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments, and Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Investors will now be able to subscribe to and redeem MMF shares using BNY’s Liquidity management platform, which has been integrated with its digital assets platform to connect with the private blockchain. The mirror tokens created on the Goldman Sachs’ private blockchain platform do not replace official records but serve as a complementary layer that increases the accessibility and potential use cases of MMF shares in a digitized financial ecosystem. The mirrored tokenization of MMF shares using blockchain represents a new model for fund management infrastructure. Although the underlying assets remain managed through traditional custodial and compliance channels, the blockchain layer enhances interoperability and real-time transferability. Goldman Sachs’ GS DAP®, is built on smart contract technology from the startup Digital Asset and offers programmable finance functionality for institutions. BNY Mellon’s LiquidityDirectSM platform is also one of the leading portals for institutional cash investors, and the integration of the private blockchain opens the door to extending MMF shares into use cases like collateral optimization and intraday liquidity management. According to Laide Majiyagbe, BNY Mellon’s Global Head of Liquidity, Financing and Collateral, “Mirrored tokenization of MMF shares is a first step in this transition,” noting the company’s position as a link between established financial systems and new technology. GS DAP® was previously piloted for bond issuance on blockchain networks in Asia and Europe. Its adaptation for MMF share representation in the US signals a broader vision for tokenizing real-world assets beyond equities and debt, potentially reshaping capital markets infrastructure. This particular use case focuses on liquidity and settlement efficiency in short-term investment vehicles, valued at over $7 trillion globally, according to ICI data. Mathew McDermott, Global Head of Digital Assets at Goldman Sachs, emphasized the potential benefits of using tokenized MMF shares as collateral in various trading and settlement contexts. “Using tokens representing the value of shares of Money Market Funds on GS DAP® would enable us to unlock their utility as a form of collateral and open up more seamless transferability in the future,” he said in a statement. BNY Mellon will continue to serve as the official recordkeeper, maintaining existing regulatory compliance and settlement protocols. However, the addition of tokenized mirrors creates new flexibility for financial institutions seeking to modernize collateral management and liquidity strategies. While this initiative currently focuses on US MMFs, both institutions signaled interest in expanding the model globally, potentially applying similar technology to other fund structures and asset classes.

Title: As S4 struggles, Sir Martin Sorrell keeps firing shots at the industry he created

Connect with execs from The New York Times, TIME, Dotdash Meredith and many more Sir Martin Sorrell has never lacked for sharp opinions. That’s expected from the architect of the holdco company era. But lately, his commentary has gone from reflective to biting. In recent months, he dismissed WPP’s consolidation efforts as a “disgrace”, lobbed shade at Omnicom for what he implied would be an overpriced acquisition of IPG and blamed WPP’s current struggles on what he called “weak leadership” under CEO Mark Read. In June, he went further: WPP, he said, might be beyond saving. Needless to say, Sir Martin makes his views known. “People, including you, ask for my views,” said Sir Martin in an email to Digiday in response to a request for comment on this story. “I’ve spent almost 50 years at Saatchi & Saatchi, WPP and S4Capital — perhaps, as a continued shareholder in WPP, I have some helpful experience and views.” Helpful or not, those views come with baggage. S4 Capital, the company he built in response to the holdco model he now criticizes, has lost 97% of its market value, issued multiple profit warnings and been caught in the crosswinds of shifting ad budgets. His pointed commentary hasn’t gone unnoticed. “I only wish he was as vocal and clear minded on what needs to be done at S4,” said Anthony Freedman, CEO of marketing services group Common Interest and a shareholder of S4 Capital, on LinkedIn. Sir Martin sees no contradiction. He’s clear-eyed about S4’s challenges — but sees them as macroeconomic not structural. The plan, as he told Digiday, is to stay the course — tighten operations, ride out the volatility and focus on growth in the Americas, Middle East and APAC where clients are still chasing gains. In Europe, he’s betting on a push for greater efficiency and effectiveness. S4 Capital, he insisted, was built for moments like this — when clients demand more for less and faster. The company is focused “on top-line growth with our existing clients and new ones, improved operating margins and liquidity, focussing particularly on improved pricing, billability and reducing duplication,” he wrote. But markets don’t trade on messaging alone. In September 2021, S4 Capital’s shares peaked at $12.25. Today, they hover near 30 cents. Whether there’s an actual bounceback is unclear — but Sir Martin sees one. He points to a current blue-chip client list that includes Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, GM, T-Mobile and Walmart as well as a newly won CPG advertiser he declined to name, as proof that the model still works. As for the broader slowdown in ad dollars from tech clients? That was inevitable, he said. “With 50% of our almost $1B of revenues coming from tech there has been pressure on opex and hence marketing as the “Magnificient 7” and others spend over half a trillion dollars on AI-related capex,” wrote Sir Martin. What’s certain is this: Sir Martin’s critique of the holding company model may still resonate, but the industry feels that it hits differently when coming from someone whose own reinvention is under just as much strain. “What you have to question is, does he provide enough day-to-day leadership?,” said one source who knows Sir Martin well. But it wasn’t always like this. In its early days, S4 Capital had momentum. Launched in 2018 with Sir Martin freshly out of WPP, the company moved quickly — acquiring MediaMonks and MightyHive within months, and landing marquee clients like Procter & Gamble, Nestle, Mondelez and Bayer in its first year. “I always thought the work from them was outstanding, and a big part of that was down to the people who worked there,” said a senior marketer familiar with the group’s pitch, speaking on condition of anonymity. “They weren’t just typical ad agency people, they were from tech and consulting backgrounds.” For a time, this was the story of S4 Capital: proof that a tech-first approach could disrupt the industry. But as the years went on, the cracks began to show. Audit delays in 2022 rocked investor confidence. The following year brought revised revenue guidance — twice — along with 500 layoffs and pressure on margins. The stock cratered. By 2024, S4 Capital was still playing defense, issuing fresh profit warnings and watching its tech-heavy client base pull back on spending. In the background, a CFO change signaled yet another attempt to restore stability. “The person at the top is all about finance models and therefore doesn’t put anywhere near enough emphasis on people and the actual operating of the business,” said an exec familiar with S4’s plans, who exchanged anonymity for candor. As the issues mounted up, so did the tensions at the top. S4 Capital’s equity-heavy acquisition model, which had once helped close deals, began to backfire as the share price fell. Founders who had bought into Sir Martin’s vision started to disengage. “The model of 50% cash and 50% equity works when the share price is growing,” the same exec said. “But as soon as it starts falling, all the owners of the acquired companies become extremely disgruntled, demotivated and less productive.” Despite these issues, few in the industry are ready to count Sir Martin out. His track record, stubbornness and proximity to power still matter. But there’s a growing sense — even amongst those who admire him — that the public markets may no longer be the right arena. “In 12 months’ time, I believe S4 Capital will not exist in its current form,” said an ad exec, with knowledge of the internal issues at the business. Industry chatter suggests that delisting is one option. A merger or acquisition is another. Some believe parts of the business could be spun out through a management buyout. However it unfolds, the status quo isn’t expected to hold. Sir Martin did not comment on any of these potential routes for the company. “I don’t think any public company chairman could or should answer that,” he wrote.” At S4 Capital, I’m focussed on long-term shareowner value maximization and acting in the best interests of all shareowners.” Where S4 will end up is anyone’s guess. It certainly can’t keep headed in the same direction it’s been going. Sir Martin knows what’s wrong with holding companies, but has not yet proven he knows how to build the alternative. The thinking behind the acquisition is to round out Brainlabs’ offering to be more full-funnel, given Exverus’ abilities at the upper end of it. While S&P 500 selection criteria is nuanced, the snub of a peer with a much larger market capitalization warrants questions. There are still numerous sticking points to resolve in CTV if marketers are to feel they’re receiving value for their investment.

Title: World Liberty’s 3,473 Ethereum Purchase Sets Tone As Companies Pile Into Altcoin
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/world-libertys-3400-ethereum-purchase-sets-tone-as-firms-pile-into-altcoin/
Time Published: 2025-07-24T03:00:29Z

World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture linked to US President Donald Trump, has made another big move into Ethereum. The group converted $13 million worth of USDC into 3,473 ETH, adding to its already large stash of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The move pushes the platform’s total Ethereum holdings to 73,616 ETH—worth about $275 million based on current prices. This latest transaction continues a buying trend that’s gained attention over the past few months. Data from Lookonchain shows that World Liberty Financial is sitting on an unrealized profit of more than $33 million. The project’s average entry price for Ethereum sits around $3,272. With ETH trading higher now, the bet appears to be paying off. Trump’s World Liberty(@worldlibertyfi) just spent 13M $USDC to buy 3,473 $ETH at $3,743 again! World Liberty has bought a total of 73,616 $ETH($275M) at an average price of $3,272, with an unrealized profit of $33M+.https://t.co/0qWkRUhTQb pic.twitter.com/WG1zpl3PJC — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 23, 2025 Last week, World Liberty also picked up over 3,000 ETH for $10 million. In May, they added another 1,580 ETH at a cost of $3.5 million. These steady acquisitions show a clear strategy: accumulate ETH and hold while prices climb. On the market side, Ethereum has responded with more green candles. The token rose 2% in the last 24 hours, hitting a daily high of $3,763. Over the past week, ETH is up 20%. Over the last month, it’s gained 65%. World Liberty Financial is not alone in taking a deep plunge into Ethereum. SharpLink and Bitmine have also boosted their ETH positions. And BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is said to be developing increasing interest in Ethereum, after establishing a strong presence in the Bitcoin arena. The momentum has also fueled the emergence of Ether Machine, a $1.6 billion Ethereum-specific effort. That effort is backed by the likes of Pantera Capital, Archetype, Kraken, Blockchain.com, and Electric Capital. All these moves set the scenario for Ethereum to be a leading option among the major players, not merely independent traders. The surging interest is driving ETH into the mainstream limelight. While new investors are buying in, older Ethereum holders are also stirring. Some dormant wallets recently moved vast amounts of the altcoin. This type of movement is bound to attract notice. It’s not the money—it’s when. And with so many of the major players stepping in, even long-quiet holders may find this the time to do something. Ethereum isn’t merely riding a wave of price activity. Institutions, funds, and political parties are stockpiling it, quietly transforming it into something bigger than another crypto token.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Starbucks’ coffee isn’t the only thing at the company that’s amped up. Its CEO, Brian Niccol, made a whopping 6,666 times more than the company’s typical employee last year, according to the AFL-CIO’s annual Executive Paywatch report, released Wednesday. It was the widest pay gap by far between the top executive and median worker among the nation’s 500 largest public companies listed in the report. Niccol, who took over the company’s helm last September, received nearly $98 million in compensation, compared to the typical Starbucks worker’s pay of less than $15,000, according to the report, which drew from corporate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Starbucks is but one example of the hefty pay gap between America’s corporate leaders and their workers, which grew even larger in 2024. CEOs at the largest public companies took home $18.9 million last year, or 285 times as much as the typical US worker’s paycheck of $49,500. That’s up from a ratio of 268 to 1 a year earlier, according to the AFL-CIO, a powerful federation of labor unions representing 15 million workers. The typical employee would have had to start working in 1740 to earn what the average CEO received in 2024, the report noted. CEO pay at S&P 500 companies increased 7% in 2024 from the prior year. It topped the prior peak of $18.3 million in 2021, though the ratio was 324 to 1 that year. The typical private sector worker’s raise last year was 3%, the AFL-CIO said, citing Bureau of Labor Statistics data. At Starbucks, the typical worker is a part-time barista in the US, the company said in its SEC filing. It noted that many of its employees work in part-time, flexible positions, which has the effect of lowering the compensation level of its median employee. Also, the calculation includes its global workforce of about 361,000 staffers, not just the roughly 210,000 US-based workers. Some staffers at the coffee retailer have formed a union, Starbucks Workers United, and have staged strikes at various locations in recent years. Among their demands is a wage increase. It’s “no wonder why the workers there at Starbucks are fighting to form a union with the Starbucks Workers Union to improve their pay and working conditions,” Fred Redmond, AFL-CIO’s secretary-treasurer, told reporters. “And these numbers only begin to scratch the surface of how runaway executive pay is fueling economic inequality.” Starbucks did not immediately return a request for comment. In its report this year, the AFL-CIO highlighted that the sweeping tax and spending cuts package that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4 will provide CEOs with far bigger tax breaks than workers. The average CEO will receive a tax cut of nearly $490,000 from the permanent extension of the lower individual income tax rates, which were initially reduced in Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the report found. That compares to a $765 tax break for the typical US worker. Unlike workers, salaries are not the largest component of CEOs’ compensation. Nearly half of the top executives’ total pay was restricted stock awards, and another $4 million were bonuses. The highest-paid CEO of an S&P 500 company was Patrick Smith of Axon Enterprise, which manufactures Tasers and other weapons for law enforcement and the military. He received a package of nearly $165 million. Most stock quote data provided by BATS. US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

Unlike legacy dairy companies with large liquid milk exposure, Milky Mist has consciously built its business around high-margin products like paneer, cheese, curd, and yogurt. As of FY25, value-added products contributed a significant portion of its ₹2,350 crore topline, which has grown at a 30% CAGR over the last three years. However, profitability has been volatile. PAT dropped from ₹27.2 crore in FY23 to ₹19.4 crore in FY24, before rebounding to ₹46.1 crore in FY25—impacted by higher depreciation and finance costs from recent capacity investments. The company’s EBITDA margin stood at 11.6% in FY25. Operationally, the Perundurai plant runs at 110% utilization for paneer, reflecting both efficiency and potential capacity strain. 98% of milk procurement still comes from Tamil Nadu, posing concentration risk. The IPO proceeds aim to expand whey and yogurt capacity, reduce debt, and strengthen distribution through branded refrigeration units. In a sector known for supply chain complexity and margin compression, Milky Mist’s execution-led strategy offers visibility. However, scaling beyond South India while maintaining product quality and procurement control will be critical post-listing.” Drug maker Lupin on Thursday said it has received approval from the US health regulator to market generic medications to treat diabetes. The company has received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for its abbreviated new drug applications for Liraglutide Injection single-patient-use prefilled pens and glucagon for injection vials, the drug maker said in a statement. Lupin receives USFDA approval for generic diabetes medications, including Liraglutide Injection and Glucagon for Injection. India’s electricity demand is projected to triple by 2035, reaching over 4,000 TWh, driven by industrial expansion, urbanization, digital infrastructure, and the electrification of transport. Meeting this surge will require a massive scaleup in generation capacity across renewables like Solar and Wind, thermal, and nuclear, alongside robust transmission and distribution upgrades. This report outlines the estimated capital investment needed to build a resilient, sustainable, and future-ready power ecosystem. Here are key pointers from our analysis: According to the NEP, solar is expected to contribute 40% of India’s installed capacity by 2032—a figure we project to slightly increase to 41% by 2035, reflecting continued momentum in solar deployment. Coal’s share, which NEP estimates at 29% by 2032, is projected to decline further to 24% by 2035 in our analysis, consistent with India’s decarbonization goals and the growing dominance of renewables. Wind energy, which NEP places at 13%, is expected to rise significantly to 21% by 2035, capturing a portion of coal’s declining share and contributing to grid diversification. Other sources such as hydro, nuclear, and biomass remain relatively stable in both projections, supporting baseload and regional reliability. This alignment with NEP validates our methodology and also highlights the strategic direction India is taking toward a cleaner, more balanced energy future. “We have started FY26 on a strong note with sustained growth across all key parameters.

The Company reported a Gross Written Premium (GWP) of INR 3250 crores, maintaining its upward momentum. Excluding the impact of 1/n accounting norm, the GWP of the Company grew by 25.6% for Q1FY26. The Company gained 78 basis points improvement in private market share, i.e. 6.19% reflecting growing customer preference and an expanding footprint across key markets. The Profit Before Tax (PBT) stood at INR 249 crores, while the loss ratio improved significantly from 86.2% to 81.7%, indicating stronger portfolio quality and disciplined underwriting. Continuing to outpace industry growth, the company reported a Profit After Tax (PAT) of INR 188 crores. The solvency ratio stood at 2.08, well above the regulatory requirement demonstrating strong financial stability. SBI General Insurance continues to lead the Personal Accident (PA) segment, maintaining its position as the No. 1 private insurer. The company gained market share in the key categories of Health by 72 bps , Motor by 47 bps and Personal Accident by 49 bps. The Health and Motor Insurance lines of business remain key growth drivers, while other segments, such as Fire, Engineering, and Liability, have also contributed significantly to the growth.

RCOM is under insolvency proceedings for over six years, while RHFL’s resolution was upheld by the Supreme Court. Reliance Power reaffirmed that its governance and operations remain unaffected and continues to focus on business execution and stakeholder value. Supreme Industries Ltd., a plastics products maker, reported a mixed set of earnings for Q1FY26.

The firm expects the rupee to strengthen to 84 per U.S. dollar by the final quarter of calendar year 2025. Barclays, meanwhile, argues the rupee’s decline over recent months is “reaching limits over the short term,” and recommends fading any weakness around 86.50-87.00 levels. - Reuters Zydus Lifesciences Ltd. has received tentative approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for its Ibrutinib tablets in 140 mg, 280 mg, and 420 mg strengths.

(PTI) The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission has approved a phased rollout of market coupling across India’s power exchanges, beginning with three months of pilot run. The decision shifts price-setting responsibilities from individual exchanges to a central body, a development that may hurt Indian Energy Exchange, which currently handles the bulk of trade volumes and plays a key role in price discovery. The Commission has asked the Grid Controller of India to start with pilot testing of three mechanisms: coupling the Real-Time Market (RTM) across all exchanges, coupling the RTM with Security Constrained Economic Dispatch, and coupling the Day-Ahead Market. The change is aimed at improving market efficiency, but it reduces the commercial price discovery role of exchanges like IEX in determining prices. Since IEX earns most of its revenue from high-volume trading in the Day-Ahead Market and Real-Time Market segments, the shift could affect its position and profitability.

Unlike legacy dairy companies with large liquid milk exposure, Milky Mist has consciously built its business around high-margin products like paneer, cheese, curd, and yogurt. As of FY25, value-added products contributed a significant portion of its ₹2,350 crore topline, which has grown at a 30% CAGR over the last three years. However, profitability has been volatile. PAT dropped from ₹27.2 crore in FY23 to ₹19.4 crore in FY24, before rebounding to ₹46.1 crore in FY25—impacted by higher depreciation and finance costs from recent capacity investments. The company’s EBITDA margin stood at 11.6% in FY25. Operationally, the Perundurai plant runs at 110% utilization for paneer, reflecting both efficiency and potential capacity strain. 98% of milk procurement still comes from Tamil Nadu, posing concentration risk. The IPO proceeds aim to expand whey and yogurt capacity, reduce debt, and strengthen distribution through branded refrigeration units. In a sector known for supply chain complexity and margin compression, Milky Mist’s execution-led strategy offers visibility. However, scaling beyond South India while maintaining product quality and procurement control will be critical post-listing.” Drug maker Lupin on Thursday said it has received approval from the US health regulator to market generic medications to treat diabetes. The company has received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for its abbreviated new drug applications for Liraglutide Injection single-patient-use prefilled pens and glucagon for injection vials, the drug maker said in a statement. Lupin receives USFDA approval for generic diabetes medications, including Liraglutide Injection and Glucagon for Injection. India’s electricity demand is projected to triple by 2035, reaching over 4,000 TWh, driven by industrial expansion, urbanization, digital infrastructure, and the electrification of transport. Meeting this surge will require a massive scaleup in generation capacity across renewables like Solar and Wind, thermal, and nuclear, alongside robust transmission and distribution upgrades. This report outlines the estimated capital investment needed to build a resilient, sustainable, and future-ready power ecosystem. Here are key pointers from our analysis: According to the NEP, solar is expected to contribute 40% of India’s installed capacity by 2032—a figure we project to slightly increase to 41% by 2035, reflecting continued momentum in solar deployment. Coal’s share, which NEP estimates at 29% by 2032, is projected to decline further to 24% by 2035 in our analysis, consistent with India’s decarbonization goals and the growing dominance of renewables. Wind energy, which NEP places at 13%, is expected to rise significantly to 21% by 2035, capturing a portion of coal’s declining share and contributing to grid diversification. Other sources such as hydro, nuclear, and biomass remain relatively stable in both projections, supporting baseload and regional reliability. This alignment with NEP validates our methodology and also highlights the strategic direction India is taking toward a cleaner, more balanced energy future. “We have started FY26 on a strong note with sustained growth across all key parameters.

(PTI) The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission has approved a phased rollout of market coupling across India’s power exchanges, beginning with three months of pilot run. The decision shifts price-setting responsibilities from individual exchanges to a central body, a development that may hurt Indian Energy Exchange, which currently handles the bulk of trade volumes and plays a key role in price discovery. The Commission has asked the Grid Controller of India to start with pilot testing of three mechanisms: coupling the Real-Time Market (RTM) across all exchanges, coupling the RTM with Security Constrained Economic Dispatch, and coupling the Day-Ahead Market. The change is aimed at improving market efficiency, but it reduces the commercial price discovery role of exchanges like IEX in determining prices. Since IEX earns most of its revenue from high-volume trading in the Day-Ahead Market and Real-Time Market segments, the shift could affect its position and profitability.

Title: Elon Musk wants more control of Tesla so activist investors can’t boot him—but not so much the board can’t fire him if he goes ‘crazy’

Amanda Gerut is the west coast editor at Fortune, overseeing publicly traded businesses, executive compensation, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, and investigations. Tesla CEO Elon Musk just confessed that he thinks his 13% ownership stake in the electric vehicle manufacturer leaves him vulnerable to activist shareholders who could move to oust him from the $1 trillion company. Still, he admitted he shouldn’t have so much control over Tesla that the board can’t fire him if he goes “crazy,” he said during an earnings call on Wednesday. “It is a big deal—I don’t want to find I have so little control I can be easily ousted by activist shareholders,” Musk said. “That is a major concern to me as I’ve mentioned in the past and I hope that is addressed at the upcoming shareholders meeting.” I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned.Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla. You don’t seem to understand…— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 15, 2024 Musk owns 13% of Tesla, a stake currently valued around $139 billion. He has previously stated he wants to own 25% of the electric vehicle manufacturer as it further expands into AI with unassisted Full Self Driving and robotics. Such a stake would be worth about $267.5 billion and would eclipse holdings by large institutional investors in Tesla such as Vanguard and Blackrock. Musk has worried in the past about the influence of activist investors or proxy advisory firms steering Tesla down the wrong long-term path at the expense of short-term pressures. However, Tesla currently maintains a defensive position against activists. Its bylaws call for what is termed a supermajority vote requirement, meaning shareholder votes must achieve support from two thirds of all outstanding shares (66.67%) rather than a simple 50% majority in order to pass. The board committed last year to Tesla shareholders that it would eliminate the supermajority vote requirement, but it hasn’t been able to muster enough investor participation. Tesla amended its bylaws in 2023 to provide shareholders with proxy access rights, meaning a shareholder or group of shareholders owning 3% or more of Tesla for at least three years can nominate directors to Tesla’s board. A stake that size would be valued at more than $20 billion. Securities and Exchange Commission rules require activist investors to disclose their stakes in company stock once they reach 5%, which is also the point where an activist can typically gain credibility with the board. A 5% stake in Tesla is worth more than $30 billion. In comparison, legendary activist investor Nelson Peltz took on the Walt Disney board after building a stake valued at about $3.5 billion at its peak. Activist investors often typically target small-cap publicly traded companies. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk shared his view on his ownership stake in response to an analyst’s question about how comfortable the CEO was in evolving Tesla in new directions with only the 13% stake. Musk pointed the annual shareholder meeting, which will be held November 6, as a potential issue to get aired out then. “I think that, as I’ve mentioned before, I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction, but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy,” he said. Musk has been working without a base salary or annual bonus for years, after the Tesla board granted him a moonshot pay package once valued as high as $56 billion—the highest for a publicly traded CEO. However, that pay package was twice rescinded by a judge and Tesla has announced it formed a board committee to hash out next steps. With the delay in Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting, the company has not yet published a proxy report to shareholders, which typically includes executive compensation disclosures. Tesla reported mixed results in its second quarter financials on Wednesday. Revenue declined 12% year-over-year to $22.5 billion, its worst revenue performance in the past decade. Operating income dropped 42% year-over-year to under $1 billion, although Tesla was still profitable with $1.2 billion in GAAP net income. Meanwhile, free cash flow cratered 89% year-over-year to $146 million, compared to $1.3 billion during the same quarter last year. Deliveries were down 13% to 384,122, although there were some major developments noted. Tesla launched its much-ballyhooed Robotaxi pilot in Austin, and it boosted its AI training capacity. Separately, Tesla opened a new diner and drive-in theater at a mega charging station in Hollywood this week. Tesla executives did not address speculation about a Tesla investment in Musk’s xAI, nor did they address questions from retail investors about Musk’s involvement in politics and its impact on Tesla’s value. Retail investors post questions on an open platform for Tesla shareholders called Say in advance of the earnings releases. Many related to Musk had to do with his compensation and the board’s plan to oversee Musk’s future political moves. “Elon the person has freedom of speech,” wrote one shareholder representing 47,000 shares. “The brand ambassador of Tesla does not. What is the board doing to distance Tesla from the private actions of its CEO?” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: AWS reportedly shutters AI research lab in Shanghai

UPDATED 19:12 EDT / JULY 23 2025 by Maria Deutscher Amazon Web Services Inc. has reportedly closed an artificial intelligence lab that it operated in Shanghai. The Financial Times reported the move today. The Amazon Web Services AI Shanghai Lablet, as the shuttered facility was known, opened in 2018. It’s unclear how many staffers the center employed. The researchers’ areas of focus included natural language processing and AI development tooling. AWS’ Shanghai AI lab played a key role in creating the Deep Graph Library, an open-source tool for training graph neural networks. Those are AI models optimized to process graphs. A graph is a data structure that can describe how different business records relate to one another, which is valuable for many analytics projects. A former applied scientist at the lab reportedly announced its closure in a post on WeChat, China’s most popular social network. The Financial Post cited the researcher as saying that the lab “was being dissolved due to strategic adjustments amid U.S.-China tensions.” Earlier this month, the U.S. rescinded rules that prevented Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. from exporting AI chips to China. However, officials have indicated that they could increase scrutiny of such chip sales going forward. A newly released policy paper from the White House recommends that the U.S. government “pursue creative approaches to export control enforcement.” It’s also possible the closure of the AI lab is related to a recent round of layoffs at AWS. According to Reuters, the Amazon.com Inc. unit has cut “at least hundreds” of roles. It’s believed that AWS’ training and certification team was among the affected business units. “After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we’ve made the difficult business decision to eliminate some roles across particular teams in AWS,” an Amazon spokesperson told Nikkei Asia today. Other companies are also scaling back their AI work in China. The Financial Times cited sources as saying that McKinsey & Co., a management consulting firm, has instructed its business unit in China to avoid taking on generative AI projects. The unit employs more than 1,000 workers. Earlier this year, AWS rival Microsoft Corp. reportedly extended relocation offers to 700-800 of its staffers in China. According to the Wall Street Journal, the employees who received the offers work on AI and cloud projects. The staffers reportedly represent about 10% of the workforce at Microsoft’s Asia Pacific research and development group, which is largely based in China. It’s believed the company earlier shuttered its IoT and AI Insider Lab in Shanghai. Microsoft operates several such facilities around the world. As of 2017, they focused on helping the company’s customers build AI-powered connected devices. Support our open free content by sharing and engaging with our content and community.

Title: Jeff Bezos weighing possible acquisition of CNBC cable network: sources

Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has been weighing a possible acquisition of CNBC, The Post has learned. The 61-year-old e-commerce magnate has signaled interest to business associates in buying the cable network — home to “Squawk Box” and “Mad Money with Jim Cramer” — after it is spun off by NBCUniversal parent Comcast later this year, according to a person familiar with Bezos’ thinking. CNBC would “align well with his interests,” said another source close to Bezos, who noted that the network could serve as a credible “neutral voice” in his media portfolio — a major plus following Bezos’s headaches as owner of the left-leaning Washington Post. The Amazon founder has weathered months of headline-grabbing chaos at the iconic newspaper, which has been mired in losses, layoffs and staff protests over his moves to shift the paper’s coverage in a more centrist, pro-capitalist direction. A rep for Bezos declined to comment. Comcast, meanwhile, plans to spin off its struggling cable assets — which also include MSNBC, USA Network and E! — by the end of the year. CNBC will become part of a publicly-traded company called Versant, which will be run by a handful of NBCUniversal execs led by Chief Executive Mark Lazarus. Sources close to Comcast told The Post that Bezos has not approached the cable giant headed by CEO Brian Roberts. Another source close the situation said Versant plans to grow CNBC, not sell it. Versant declined to comment. It is unclear how much Bezos — currently ranked as the fourth richest person in the world with a net worth of $241 billion, according to Forbes — would be willing to pony up for CNBC. Comcast does not break out financials for its cable assets but recently said the soon-to-be spun-off Versant generated about $7 billion in revenue last year. Buying CNBC would be tricky. There is a two-year period in which Versant could not engage in selling major assets like CNBC or even the entire company without major tax implications, sources told The Post. A source close to the situation said the company won’t likely jeopardize the tax-free nature of the spinoff. Late last year, Comcast announced it would hive off its cable assets and keep NBCUniversal’s NBC broadcast TV network, “Real Housewives” home Bravo, its film and TV studios and theme parks, as well streaming service Peacock. Bezos bought the Washington Post from the family of Katharine Graham in 2013 for $250 million, but the paper since has been dogged by steep losses as subscribers have fled. The Amazon founder has been vacationing with his new bride Lauren Sanchez in the South of France. They were spotted Tuesday leaving glitzy beach club Le Club 55, not far from where the mogul’s mega-yacht, Koru, dropped anchor. Bezos’ desire to expand his media empire follows a flurry of headlines in recent weeks that he was interested in buying Vogue magazine for Sanchez, a former TV reporter — or even the fashion glossy’s parent company Condé Nast. Over the past year, Bezos and Washington Post CEO Will Lewis have tried to move the Beltway broadsheet more to the center — to the dismay of staffers. Bezos’ decision to kill the newspaper’s endorsement of Kamala Harris for president shortly before the election in November sparked a revolving door of high-profile departures. More than 300,000 readers canceled their subscriptions. The uproar continued after Bezos ordered the outlet’s opinion section to focus on “personal liberties and free markets” — a more neutral topic — rather than weighing in on politics and other issues. The directive led to the resignation of Opinion Editor David Shipley, followed by the departure of longtime columnist Ruth Marcus. On Monday, Pulitzer Prize-winning opinion writer Jonathan Capehart announced he accepted a buyout. Advertisement

On the podcast I talk with John about the fascinating 40-year history of Apple’s developer relations, how almost going bankrupt in the 1990s shaped today’s control-focused approach, and why we might need an ‘App Store 3.0’ reset. Top Takeaways: 🕹️ The 1980s: Apple’s developer DNA was born Apple’s earliest wins came from nurturing third-party developers, even spinning off its own apps to avoid competing with outsiders. 💸 Microsoft saved Apple (literally) Apple’s near-bankruptcy in the ’90s made them both humble and wary—forever shaping how they deal with developers and competition. 🍎 From “please build for us” to “we choose you” WWDC 2008 saw Apple begging for apps and evangelist emails on slides; today, it’s the other way around. 🖥️ The “Delicious Era” fueled iPhone success Mac indie devs (Panic, Delicious Monster, Bare Bones) built a design-obsessed, passionate community—setting the stage for the iPhone App Store boom. 🚪 App Store 1.0: A new world for indies For the first time, solo developers could launch businesses from home. No server costs, no payments hassle—just build, submit, and sell. 🏦 Apple’s rules got stricter as the App Store grew As the App Store became a services giant, the partnership vibe faded. Developers went from partners to “users” of Apple’s marketplace. 📉 App Store math now feels upside down Today, indie devs can pay Apple millions, while giants like Meta pay almost nothing. The fee logic and incentives don’t fit 2025. ⏳ The platform needs an “App Store 3.0” reset John and David call for a new era: lower fees, clearer rules, and Apple acting as a true platform partner—not just a toll booth. 🔄 Developer enthusiasm is Apple’s long-term moat Apple risks becoming a “legacy only” giant if it loses developer goodwill. The most important apps are still built by outsiders. 👥 A generational handoff is coming With Apple’s senior leadership nearing retirement, now is the time to set new priorities: empower developers, invest in the ecosystem, and ensure Apple’s platforms stay vibrant for decades to come. Resources: Follow us on X: David Barnard: Welcome to the Sub Club Podcast, a show dedicated to the best practices for building and growing app businesses.

My guest today is John Gruber, Raconteur, Apple aficionado, podcast host and sole proprietor of Daring Fireball. On the podcast, I talk with John about the fascinating 40-year history of Apple's developer relations, how almost going bankrupt in the '90s shaped today's control-focused approach and why we might need an App Store 3.0 reset. Hey, John, thanks so much for coming back on the podcast. John Gruber: Well, you've been on my show. I hope to have you on my show again soon, so it's the least I can do. I'm happy to be here. David Barnard: So today, I want to talk Apple Kremlinology, which I think is maybe a great term. I just threw it out there. Apple is such a unique organization that... And for most developers, it's like our most important partner. And I'm doing air quotes for those listening on the podcast. And I don't think a lot of people understand Apple, and I think a lot of how people interact with Apple, what they think of Apple is shaped by just not understanding them, which is maybe on Apple. But that's what I wanted to talk about today was better understanding Apple. And I think of all the people to have this conversation with, it's going to be really fun to have it with you. John Gruber: I appreciate that and only because, and I hate to flatter myself. I really do. I really do. I try to stay as humble as possible. I feel like that's what keeps me in the game. But understanding Apple to me is maybe one of the top three things I have. I really.... David Barnard: Yeah. Yeah, totally. John Gruber: And there's always been an intuitive, oh, I love this company vibe fit and some other rolls of the dice of the way my life could have worked out surely on many of the other rolls of the dice. I end up working at Apple for some amount of time, possibly a very short amount of time, because every time I've ever had a job in my life where I actually am not self-employed has not lasted all that long. So probably not long, but one of my earliest memories, I think it was either fifth or sixth grade, which was early '80s, probably like 1983, '84, I just remember reading a story about Apple Computer and I knew at the time that I liked Apple Computers better than other company's computers, and I loved computers. But I remember reading a story about the company and reading that all of the employees just show up to work in sneakers and jeans and T-shirts and that they wear clever T-shirts and they make. Every time they start a new project, the first job is to print up T-shirts for the team for the new project, and then they wear them to work. And I remember thinking, that's awesome because I don't want to wear a freaking suit and tie to work. And I remember telling my dad this and my dad telling me, "John, there is no way that a major computer company lets the people show up to work in jeans and T-shirts." And I was like, "No, I'm telling you, dad, I read it in a magazine. It's true." David Barnard: That's awesome. And then not to flutter myself, but while we're... We should have scripted this, and I should have done this for you and you should have done this for me, but I relied on ChatGPT pretty heavily to do research for the show because I wanted to go really in-depth in the history of Apple and their relationships with developers. And last night, I'm getting through my notes and ChatGPT says, "Three of the prominent voices in App Store related topics are John Gruber, Ben Thompson and David Barnard." And I don't know if it knew it was me and was freaking trying to flatter me or whatever, but I mean, similar to you in a way that the App Store is something I'm unreasonably passionate about. I have an emotional attachment to the App Store and care so deeply about it. And in part, and you know I've discussed this, I was a recording engineer and I knew that was kind of a dead end as far as having a family and being able to provide and stuff like that. But I was a huge Apple nerd, so I got a 17-inch PowerBook in 2003. So my Apple journey begins a little later. I mean, I used them in college and I played with a original Mac in the '80s, but my real Apple fanboyism started in 2002, 2003. So I jumped right into the App Store in 2008 thinking, "Okay, this is an opportunity to build a real career that's going to provide for my family." And it did. I'm 17 years into owning an app business and I care so deeply about the store and then also care so deeply about Apple. And so everything we're going to talk about today, it's like you being one of the people who cares the most about Apple, who's outside Apple, and me, one of the people who cares the most about the App Store outside of Apple, I think is the two right people to have this kind of conversation. And maybe we should have had Ben on and to have a third voice, but... John Gruber: There are certain things that I just remember which years they were, and I just remember that 2007 iPhone no App Store, 2008 App Store comes out. 2009, it really takes off and coincides really with the go-go years of Twitter. And that's absolutely 100%, there's no confusion. I mean, maybe you sent me an email at daringfireball.net or something, but where I remember getting to know you was on Twitter, and I just remember like it's one of the great privileges of my position doing what I do with Daring Fireball where it's like, "Oh, I'm going to get to know this guy," and we'd at each other on Twitter about App Store issues, but I was like, "This guy," I could sense both your profound enthusiasm for it and the way that it was making you... It wasn't making a fanboy of the App Store where no matter what you wanted to say, "Oh, I love the App Store. So no matter what, I'm going to make my conclusion, whatever changes they make are great." Your enthusiasm was such that you're like, "I want to understand every single thing about this to the deepest degree." And again, it's sort of like a laziness where I'm like, "Oh, if I become friends with this guy," and I've got a Rolodex of people who are experts on whatever, it could be AppKit, could be UIKit, could be the App Store, could be... And you're at the top of the list for the App store and have been since 2009 and probably should have been since 2008. But I just remember, 2009, you were just a key follow on Twitter for App Store related stuff, and it was such a fascinating time, explosive, just an explosive time. David Barnard: Well, and I was a Gruber fanboy, and you linking to my app in the fall of 2008, I think wasn't part of turning point. I mean, they were key people who helped me along the way, including people inside Apple. And I remember vividly... John Gruber: It was the Launcher app, right? What was it called? David Barnard: No, no, no, this was 2008. You linked to my mileage logging app. When the App Store launched, there was this terrible Windows phone ish, horrible user interface, no kind of Mac or iOS interface paradigm, a mileage log. They got there first, which is still eats me to this day. 17 years later, I missed the launch of the App Store because Apple did not approve my developer account. And so a month later, I release a mileage log, it was like we follow the iOS paradigms, I mean, looking back, I don't ever feel like I had the best taste, but I didn't have... It was brown and it was not the prettiest or most, but it was iOS. We used the paradigms of iOS. We built a native app. And so you link to that in the fall of 2008, and it was a turning point. John Gruber: Well, I'm happy, I remember that. And that was the other thing that I remember about you is it wasn't just that you were obsessive about the App Store, is that you actually had skin in the game, and that you clearly... Again, I'm not just trying to butter you up here, but no, but there was at that time, at the very highest level when they first announced the iPhone and said, "Hey," and underneath it was one of the... It wasn't called a Bento box at the time. They did the slides in a different style. But at Steve Jobs original introduction, they had a bunch of things on a slide and they said Cocoa, that everything Apple had done for the original iPhone, before the iPhone, before the App Store, and before they announced, famously took them several months before they said, "Okay, we're going to do an SDK," but they said that they were using Cocoa. There's like a five-minute podcast Merlin Mann did at Macworld Expo talking to me and Jason Snell, the day of the keynote on the floor, it was like a five-minute interview with me and Snell by Merlin Mann. And Snell and I were like, "Apple didn't say much about this Cocoa thing, but presumably at some point, it's just probably not ready yet. They're going to open up APIs and this is going to be huge." I mean, this was hours after the keynote when we were still euphoric about the whole thing because everybody was sort of looking forward to just an iPod phone, right? David Barnard: Right. John Gruber: And it was so much more, it felt like my mind had gotten significantly bigger during the keynote. My brain had grown because the realm of possibility of personal computing was suddenly much larger than I thought. But in that initial moment, most developers were thinking was, "Well, that's fantastic if they're Xocoa APIs," and UIKits slightly different than AppKit, but every single AppKit going back to next developer I know looked at the initial UIKit APIs and was like, "Oh, all right, this is different, but I know this, this is very familiar." But the idea that developers had was how do you take ideas that are good Mac apps and put them on the phone? And for many apps, that was a great idea and Apple itself did that, right? Safari, mail, how do you take mail and make a version that fits on the phone? But the opportunity that I think Mac developers didn't think of right away is what sort of ideas only make sense for a phone, a little pocket, 3.5 inch screen device that's with you all the time. That wouldn't make sense on a Mac and a mileage tracker is exactly that sort of idea. That's what I remember hitting me about that app in 2008. Like, oh, this would be stupid on the Mac. What are you going to do? Take your MacBook or PowerBook? I forget what, I guess they were MacBook set by 2008, but what are you going to do? Take a laptop with you in your car everywhere and log your gas and mileage? No, but for something that would replace what you would've done in a pocket notebook, that's a perfect idea. Obviously, people want this. And that's where I feel like you were ahead of me and I'm like, "I got to follow this guy because he's thinking about things that are phone first." David Barnard: Right. Yeah. Well, enough navel-gazing. I'm blushing. But I appreciate all of that. And again, just the perfect person to have this kind of conversation with, which I've wanted to have this conversation for a while in service of the community of... In my day job at RevenueCat, and I do still build apps on the side, so I'm still an indie developer, I was looking at my LinkedIn the other day and 17 years at Contrast and still going strong, still running my weather app on the side and stuff. So at my day job at RevenueCat, I interface with a ton of developers and a lot of them don't care one lick about Apple, in fact, I mean, the growing hostility, people who've never built an app before will book an office hours call with me and say, "Screw Apple, screw them in their 30%." There's no care for Apple as a company or the products or anything like that. And so I wanted to do this podcast to give some of that history. I was actually thinking as I was preparing these notes, it's almost a book at some point, the history of the App Store and how it shaped the world. I mean, so many decisions that Apple made, big and small, literally did shape how things happen, and we'll get into some of that. But I wanted to step all the way back, and again, in doing the research for this over the weekend, I saw something that really surprised me, and I think I knew this, but I hadn't seen the numbers. And that is that the three top executives at Apple whose teams work on the app store. So I think maybe, and Apple is famously secretive about who does what and who reports to who and those kinds of things. But from my understanding... John Gruber: They're secretive about everything, David. David Barnard: Everything, yeah. Yeah. Something like 90% of the people who interface with developers in the App Store who work on the App Store report up to three executives. Greg Joswiak, who joined Apple in 1986. John Gruber: Yeah, I think right out of college. He went to University of Michigan and went right to Apple. David Barnard: Phil Schiller, who joined Apple in 1987, and Eddy Cue who joined Apple in 1989. And so to really understand Apple and how they interact with developers and how they receive the developer community, you really do have to go all the way back to the 1980s when these three key executives joined and started, and each of them have their different role in developer relations over time. But going back to that 1984 release of the Mac and these early days of developer relations between Apple and developers, I think is so fascinating, and one of the things, again, I didn't eve... I knew, but seeing it again in black and white, just how instrumental Microsoft was in those early days to Apple that two years ahead of the 1984 release of the Mac, Microsoft had agreed to build products for this new platform. And then specifically, and again, never heard this before, but Bill Gates was kind of an Apple fanboy in some of the early days before they got really contentious. And I read this history piece about the history of Apple that said Gates would show up to events, Macworld and other events with Macintosh shirts, he would wear a Macintosh. I mean, can you even imagine Bill Gates in the '80s wearing Macintosh T-shirt? It was just such a different era. But then over time, developer relations started to get a bit contentious. What do you remember? I mean, you were, gosh, like 6, 8, 10 at the time when all this happened. And I was five. But we both read a lot about the history. So what do you recall? And then what do you remember from having read upon all this. John Gruber: Too young to have experienced those years extemporaneously, but from what I've read, one of the key superpowers that Gates had, and I think it's true, I think this is not an original observation, but no matter how big, and no matter even... I mean, I guess eventually after, when you get closer to 50 years, which Apple and Microsoft are at, but maybe closer to a century after entire original generations have clearly all died off, it fades away. But all companies in all fields are just infused with the personalities of their founders. And one of the things that Gates infused in Microsoft was an amazing willingness or just natural ability. I don't even think it was something he did purposefully. I think it's just the way his mind worked is he was always thinking what could be and was not attached to the way things were. The whole name Microsoft, the whole idea that revolution of the company was, "Hey, we could make a company." This was him and Paul Allen that just focuses on software and had no plans in those early days to make their own computer. And all of the action in the late '70s at that moment of the PC revolution, the late '70s and the early '80s was on the company's making computers, Apple and Commodore and Texas Instruments, you name it, IBM, once they made the PC and Microsoft's key insight was, "Hey, software is incredibly valuable." And at the time, that idea alone was revolutionary. It was absolutely revolutionary because everybody else thought the only thing that matters is computers and computers were all absurdly expensive. Just look at the memory that was in those computers. The Commodore 64 was called the 64, not because it was 64 bit, but because it had 64 kilobytes of RAM, right? That was the 64, and it wasn't cheap, cheap. And the idea was software, you just copy, it was just ones and zeros. You could just make copies. And the idea that no, no software is worth paying for was a revolution. And I think that's why Gates could have such incredible enthusiasm for something like some other company's computer because everything they did was for somebody else's computer. They didn't make computers and they didn't really have a platform. And so I think Gates recognized early that Apple made better computers and that they were onto something. And he clearly, from the outset, had the mindset of the complete opposite of, I forget his name, but the 1960s era, IBM CEO who said, "I think there's a market in the world for six or seven computers." Because the thinking in that era was, well, the US military will want one, maybe like the US IRS, and there'll be one great supercomputer for universities to share. Whereas Gates was really thinking early on, "Oh no, there should be computers in every house." But he wasn't thinking that Microsoft would own a platform. But then when the opportunity came with DOS and they saw the opportunity they had by owning MS-DOS and being the company that provided it, it changed their thinking completely to instead of, oh, we'll make software for anybody's computer. We're going to make a platform and we'll still make some software for other platforms, but we really want to steer everybody to our platform even though we don't make the computers. David Barnard: One of the interesting footnotes in this as well is that Apple had a similar idea of we're building this platform, we need to make sure there's software on it. And so they built Mac, right? MacPaint, MacDraw, and a bunch of other apps. And again, something I didn't realize until doing all this research was that in 1986, they stopped bundling those because it was competitive with third-party developers. And man, I mean, these days with sherlocking and Apple building an app for everything, I mean, even most recently building an invite app like building a sports app, Apple has over the last 17 years of the App Store gone deeper and deeper and further and further into competing directly with third-party developers. But back here in the '80s, they were like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We don't want to squash the potential for third-party developers to build for this platform that we have. So these apps that we built for our own platform that we have previously bundled," I mean, again, at some point maybe when Schiller or Jos or one of these guys retires, we'll do this again and get the inside scoop on some of the deeper thinking behind this. But they stopped bundling, and then in 1987, they spun all those apps off into Claris, a subsidiary of Apple to have them at little bit more of an arm's length. It's specifically to not interfere with third-party developers. And it's still fascinating to go all the way back to the '80s and see such a different Apple that they recognized the power of developers in the platform and were actively doing things at that time to make sure they didn't compete. They didn't make it a non-starter for people to build these kind of apps for the Macintosh platform, which is just fascinating. John Gruber: And it was about a decade, I would say maybe '86, '87, and those are the years where I was there as a teenager into college, and '86 to '95, '96 or so was the decade where Apple was very hands-off about first-party apps and it made sense. And one of the areas of contention, it's sort of like a heartbreak, and I forget the exact details. I know Andy Hertzfeld's wonderful, wonderful... I think there's a story about it on Folklore.org, but you can look it up. But there were two basics, the basic programming language for the Mac in the very early '80s and Apple Basic was much better and could let you do Macintosh-like things like pop open a dialog box, which you think like, well, of course, why would you want to have a programming environment for the Mac that couldn't pop open a dialog box? But that was revolutionary at the time, and Microsoft had their basic, and as like a, let's keep Microsoft happy, Apple sort of squashed their own in-house basic, which was a much better programming environment for the Macintosh. So as not to step on the toes of Microsoft Basic, which was more of a oh, character based sort of text interface basic, where you could write the same Microsoft Basic program and run it on the Mac and run it on any other computer that had Microsoft Basic. And that's just one example of that sort of thinking and this sort of thing that led them to spin off the initial, which they had to do again because nobody knew how to write these graphical user interface programs. It often comes up and people, you have to Google the images to believe it, but the original Macintosh keyboard didn't have arrow keys because they wanted to force developers and users to use the mouse as opposed to almost all other computers at the time didn't even have mice. So there was the Macintosh, which had a mouse and other computers which had no pointer interface, just a keyboard interface. So you'd be like, "What do you want to do in the computer?" And it would present a text menu and you'd use arrow keys to go up and down. I want to open existing file down. I want to create a new file down. I want to manage my files up, down, left, right. So to force developers to make programs that were mouse driven, mouse pointer driven. Apple didn't even put arrow keys on the original Macintosh keyboard, which imagine the frustration editing text now. So if you wanted to, you could backspace, there was a delete key, but if you wanted to go back a word or two, you had to go take your hands off the keyboard, go to the mouse and click where you wanted to go. But I understand why that didn't last, but I also understand the thinking at the time to break people's habits because as much as they thought this is a computer for the rest of us, which was their slogan, and this will be the way that most people in the future learn to use computers. Right now, the market is people who already know how to use computers, but what they know from the existing computers isn't the way this computer works. And so they had to make apps like MacWrite and MacPaint and MacDraw, and then two years in, they're like, "Ah, we're kind of squashing the market. What we really need is a thriving third party market, so let's go hands off." And then for the next decade, the Mac really didn't have many first party programs. If you just went to the store and bought a brand new Macintosh in 1991 or '92, you got TextEdit or it was called SimpleText at the time. There were very few apps that were built in. There was no built-in Contacts app. You didn't have all these things that you would think, "Oh, how do you have a computer without an address book?" Well, the idea was that whole thing was a third party opportunity. David Barnard: And this is a great example of why I wanted to have this conversation, and maybe we'll pull on some of these threads as we go through. One thing to understand about Apple and how they operate today is that they've had success in doing those sorts of things. And so when you look at Apple TV that famously launched, and Apple tried to get people to develop games for it, but you could only use the Apple remote, and it was Apple as with the keyboard not having arrow keys, it was, we don't want people to require a gaming controller to build games, so we're going to force them to use remote. And games sucked, and I was so pissed at Apple, it took them, what, three or four years to finally enable controller support. And by that time, it was just so clear that Apple TV was not going to be a gaming platform, maybe could have been more of a gaming platform had they done it, maybe it was the right choice, whatever. And then look at the Vision Pro. Two years ago, I was so frustrated that Apple didn't release motion track controllers like what you have on the Meta Quest, but why did they do that? It goes all the way back to 1984 and not having the arrow keys, it was, "Hey, we're introducing a new user interface paradigm, a new user experience, and we want to force developers to build apps that use hand gestures and eye tracking and not controllers." Now, two years later, they just announced at WABC that PlayStation VR controller support in Vision Pro, but this is two years after the fact, and I was so frustrated two years ago. But this is one of those things when you look back, you better understand why they make the decisions they make. They have a long history of making those kinds of decisions going all the way back to the '80s and forcing developers into the path that they think is best for the platform is just so fascinating. John Gruber: I keep repeating it. I'm more bullish on visionOS as a platform than most commentators, and I keep drawing the analogy to the original Macintosh, the original Macintosh in 1984, I know the number off the top of my head because I bring it up all the time. It was $2,500, which inflation adjusted is give or take right now, like $7,200. There was only one config. There was no option to get more RAM. There was no storage, you used floppy drives. So $2,500, it was 7,200 equivalent today about twice the cost of a Vision Pro, very expensive. It's sold so poorly and so under their expectations that it was the impetus for driving jobs out of the company. And in the whole, people don't know the history, like how in the world did Apple kick Steve Jobs out of the company? The real reasons were mostly personality conflicts, and that yes, of course, he did not work well when there was somebody else, John Sculley from Pepsi as the CEO who Jobs, the founder, ostensibly reported to, of course, Jobs did not work well as anything but the CEO, and that's ultimately the reason. But in terms of going to the board and having reasons other than this guy's a pain in my ass, to force him out, the sales of the Mac were the... And again, it was expensive and Apple couldn't really afford the fact that it was a bit of a flop in 1984, 1985, but the PC press of the time took it as, "Hey, this whole graphical user interface thing, it's clever, but it's a gimmick. This isn't how real computer users want to use a computer. Nobody wants to take their hands off the keyboard and use a mouse all the time. It's a waste of memory to be drawing all these windows and stuff like this." That was all proven wrong. The Mac was the right idea for the future of personal computing, but it needed at least four or five years before you're like, "Holy, shit, this is like a thriving platform that's revolutionizing certain industries like desktop publishing." David Barnard: Yeah. And as a 40, almost 50-year-old company, I guess next year it's 50 years, somewhere around there. Apple's patience is remarkable. This is another thing that I continually get wrong, and I think a lot of people get wrong. 100% agree on the Vision Pro. It is a phenomenal piece of hardware. It is an incredible platform for experimenting with the future, even if it's flawed and even if there are problems. But Apple's patient, and clearly they have AR stuff in the labs that Cook and others have played with. There's been reporting recently about all Tim Cook thinks about is getting to this AR glasses future or whatever it might be. And the Vision Pro is that first step along the way, and Apple is very patient, as much as people pan it as few units as they sold, even if it's been less successful as they internally hope for, they are nothing if not a patient company that's going to keep plugging away at these things. Because look how it turned out for the Mac, like you said, it took four or five years. Well, I mean, we're two years into the Vision Pro. They've got time and they've got cash to wait around and they've got the experience of building these platforms over decades, not making sure something is a hit in months and days. John Gruber: This is only based on observation, but I think I almost see how can somebody refute this is that their thinking is basically if their projection of where a hit AR/VR, let's just put aside whether the first hit product in the category will be AR or VR, but it'll probably be AR, right? VR is just too weird where my definition of the difference, the broad difference here is if the device is off, powered off, can you see anything or do you see through glasses, right? If it's glasses that when the device is at 0% battery powered off, you still see through the lenses, that's AR. And if it's like Vision Pro where it's off, it's like blindfolds, that's VR, it's probably AR, but let's just say it doesn't matter. Put that aside, that it'll take till around 2030 to have a product at a price and a feature set and a battery life that's compelling to explode in popularity and that people will be like, "I got to get one of those." If it's 2030, when that's going to come out, what's the right way to approach the market? And I think the people who are laughing at Vision Pro and saying, "It's $3,500, nobody's bought one. They've only sold hundreds of thousands, not even a million, whatever." Apple should have waited until then to release a product, and then boom, here's the first thing. And the iPhone was sort of like that, right? And the iPhone was right out of the gate. Yes, it was a little more expensive, but the first iPhone was incredibly useful, totally credible device. And I know it didn't sell in great quantities compared to today's numbers, but as somebody who bought one, it was like, "Yeah, this is real." And it's not like I'm buying a product that hints at a future. The Vision Pro is not like that. The Vision Pro is not the iPhone in 2007. The Vision Pro today, I don't like calling it a dev kit, but it's like an enthusiast kit, which includes developers, but it's an enthusiast kit that you spend a ridiculous amount of money compared to a MacBook Air. You get a really good MacBook Air for $1,000, or you could get a really good MacBook Air for 1,300, $1,400. This is three times, four times more expensive and it's less essential to people's lives than their iPhone, which you can get a really good iPhone for seven, $800. It's different than that, but is the right strategy to wait until that hardware is out in 2030 and then start there with building a platform or is the right strategy to start building a platform around 2023, 2024, and when that hardware is finally available and there's a breakthrough in the technology and the price and the capabilities in the battery life that you've got five years of ecosystem and content behind it. All these complaints, again, I've complained too and I'm a little surprised, but they're getting there, just in terms of having entertaining immersive content, the things like the Bono video and the adventure climbing mountains and all this stuff. They've got some stuff, you would think with their budget that they could have more, but the idea of, hey, if they're going to sell this thing for all this money, shouldn't they have more content available? Well, if 2030 is when they think this is going to explode, think of how much content they're going to have in the library by then. And I think that's what they know. There are so many similarities between this and the Macintosh in 1984, but there are also so many profound differences because Apple is so big and so pervasive in popular culture and people's lives. And it breeds a different sentiment towards the company, which I think we're going to continue talking about with developer relations. But then on the other hand, their profound, almost unfathomable financial success gives them the liberty of saying, "We're going to make a seven-year bet that costs a lot of money," just in terms of this thousand or so software engineers who work on Vision stuff inside the company. We're going to make a profound bet to build this out over half a decade so that when the hardware's really there for a mass-market thing, we've got it. We've already got the platform, we've already got the UI paradigms nailed down, we've got the input, we've got the sensors. We're going to be... John Gruber: ... nailed down. We've got the input, we've got the sensors. We're going to be there five years ahead of time. It's a very different way of thinking than a company that is sweating it out. Are we still going to be in business two quarters from now? David Barnard: Yeah, and I think that's part of the pushback is that too many people, especially in the press, continue to expect every product Apple releases to be the next iPhone. And the iPhone is just singular in history as a consumer electronic device that it was able to come out of the gate as such an incredible useful day one thing. Because even, and again, I mean, this is why we're having this conversation. You go back to 1984, the $2,500, which is $7,200 a day or whatever it is, was not a daily driver, this is changing my life, most productive thing in the world. It was a nice to have, it was an enthusiast, it was something to tinker with and maybe you find a few productivity things here and there that it benefits. Apple has done this decade after decade after decade, and they have that long vision. And again, going back to these execs who've been around through it all, it's like they've seen it happen and they know it will happen and they know it can happen. And to your point, they're not under that pressure of the Vision Pro has to be the iPhone. It doesn't have to be the iPhone. We've done this 10 times before with different products with transitioning from Power PC to Intel, with early days of iMac and it becoming a consumer hit that wasn't even the massive smash hit compared to the iPhone. And so it's like they know how to build platforms over decades and not over months and years that everybody else expects it to happen. John Gruber: So the one difference, and it is almost the same thing but along a different vector where I said about Gates and the way that Gates instilled in Microsoft a sort of flexibility in thinking like, hey, what's the opportunities right now? I think Satya Nadella's era as CEO embodies that where I feel like he came in and was like, you know what? We don't have to be all about Windows, Windows, Windows. We can go to more of a cloud first mindset and look at where they are financially and in cloud services and stuff. It's been a great deal for them, but that they got their institutional fortitude is once we have a hit, we will latch onto it and try to stick with it and ride it all the way down. And that was the whole mindset with Windows. Windows everywhere and they're going to put Windows on your TV set-top box and Windows phone, right? And they were trying to make smartphones years before the iPhone and literally they had a start menu in the lower left corner. It looked like Windows 95 but on a phone and it wasn't running Windows apps, but it was a mindset of bringing Windows mentality. Whereas Apple's mindset led by Steve Jobs was let's start from scratch. And as much as they wound up using the Cocoa APIs and made UI kit, it was only not because that was a starting point. It was like, okay, if we're going to do this, maybe we could fit a small version of the Mac kernel onto this device and we'll build it, but we're not going to have any compatibility. It's not going to be called the Mac phone. We're not going to have an Apple menu up in the upper left corner. We're going to rethink this whole thing from scratch. Apple has this sort of, if it's a new form factor, we're going to start with a new platform and that's a very different thinking, but at another level, just in terms of its capabilities, the reason the iPhone could debut in 2007 as a totally credible, you could buy one right now, the first one totally useful is that it's ultimately, and this is the unifying theme of the last five years of dithering with me and Ben Thompson, is that the biggest marketing shame of the entire industry is that we wasted the term personal computer on desktop and laptop computers in 1980 because the phone is ultimately the personal computer. And that's where everything was heading from the Apple One in 1977 until 2007. Everything was heading towards building something under $1,000 that fit in your pocket and had an interface that anybody could just use and that the input was just poking at it with your finger and it was all visual and it had wireless connection to a network that connected to the entire world. It was so science fiction from the perspective of 1978, 79, but within 30 years, that's where everything in those 30 years was heading. So when it launched, it was really the culmination of what we've called personal computers for 30 years, whereas Vision Pro is sort of like, let's do something all new and we have to sort of start from scratch. It's going to be way too expensive and heavy and limited and the battery's going to be a pain in the ass, but it's a totally new vector. David Barnard: Yeah, well, we've kind of gotten ahead of ourselves. I want to go all the way back to the eighties again. It's important to step through the history of these developer relations of what brought us even to the iPhone. So I'll speed through this. You and I could talk for five hours, but I don't think we should turn this into a five-hour podcast, so I'll speed through a little bit of this. But going all the way back to the eighties, PageMaker was a huge turning point. Third party app, some people have credited it as saving the Mac platform. That it was so important to digital publishing and this is where as a platform apps can revolutionize your platform. When you've built a and hardware and third party developers go nuts on it, they build new things and do things that you would've never done as a first party software closed ecosystem, it's only Apple and the Mac and we're the only ones building for it. You get this entire ecosystem of people building new things and PageMaker was one of those things that became so integral to the digital publishing world that it's credited as a third party app for saving the whole Apple Mac platform and then you get Illustrator for Mac in 87, you get Photoshop in 1990 and during this time I think Apple really recognizes that power of developers. Guy Kawasaki joined around that time. I forget exactly, I think he may have joined before the 1984 Mac, but he was the first software evangelist and developer evangelist. Again, in doing research for this and reading up on some of the history of this, I realized just how much a debt of gratitude in some ways I owe to Guy Kawasaki for me having a job today at Revenue is that he... This whole developer advocacy and people who aren't technical or... I mean, I'm mildly technical but really can promote these platforms. It goes all the way back to the eighties and Guy Kawasaki and Apple being so enthusiastic for third party developers. John Gruber: I know Guy a little, I feel like I should know him better. I feel like he sort of left this racket right around the time that I was becoming more prominent in this industry, but I've met him a few times, but I've read his books and the Macintosh Way, it's a great book if you can find a copy of it. When I joined Barebone Software, I worked at Bare Bones, the BB edit company from 2000 to 2002. It was the only mandatory reading before. It was like the entire employee onboarding process was you have to read Guy Kawasaki's the Macintosh Way, but arguably it was the Apple way and at the time though, because it was the only successful platform Apple had, the Macintosh and Apple were easily conflated, but I think that what Guy Kawasaki really crystallized was the intersection of developers, users, and the platform maker and that combined the three could form a cohesive whole that everything... And formed a flywheel where it just kept benefiting everybody where users are happy and they're buying the devices, which helps the platform maker and that the more devices the platform maker makes, the bigger the market is for third party developers. And so third party developers make more and invest more in the platform and make more innovative software that makes users like, oh my God, look what PageMaker can do. Holy crap. And then the users buy more of the... And it just keeps going and going. David Barnard: Sounds a lot like the iPhone. John Gruber: Yeah, I think that the other thing that Guy Kawasaki really crystallized was the idea that you could be an important serious player professionally in this field without being a programmer or a designer even. You could be a professional user. I'm a writer and I have a computer science degree from college from long ago, so more technical than most users, but I get that mindset where kind of what I wanted to be was a professional user, by being an enthusiast and learning how everything works. And that was his evangelism. It wasn't evangelism in the sense of evangelizing a religion based on faith. It was more like a religion based on practical advantages, like hey, learn how to do these things, learn how the actual system works and you're going to have superpowers compared to people who do the same thing as you who don't understand how these computers work. One person can do the work of 10 people with a Macintosh, and it was true. David Barnard: I saw that guy has been doing the rounds on podcasts. You should definitely have them on your podcast at some point. That'd be one I would love to listen to, you and Guy talking through this for two hours. We're kind of breezing over it in five minutes here, but I think it would be a fascinating listen for you and Guy to kind of talk through that in more detail. But we did want to keep moving. So that was the kind of eighties and into the early nineties. But then what happened in the nineties I think is kind of pivotal to Apple's relationship with developers is that in the nineties, and you know this better than I, so you can fill in the details here, but hardware sales started to tank. Things started to get really rocky for Apple and they got to this point where third-party developers had so much power over Apple that if Adobe wasn't updating their apps on the Mac platform and simultaneously the Windows platform had taken off at that point where they were probably, I assume making way more money on the Windows platform. It was kind of the platform to be on during that time, but Apple desperately needed those third-party developers to continue building for the platform to keep the platform sustainable. And that all kind of culminated in 1997 with the famous Steve Jobs standing in an auditorium with a giant screen of Bill Gates behind him and Microsoft saving Apple. And again, people who haven't studied the history or been around or not old men like you and I couldn't even fathom that Microsoft saved Apple. Had Microsoft not done that, Apple would've gone bankrupt. So fill in some of the gaps there. What happened in the nineties and how did Apple get into this desperate point where third-party developers had so much power over them needing Microsoft to save the company. John Gruber: I think point one that gets overlooked a lot in the years where Jobs was exiled from Apple, who knows what would've happened. Maybe that was for the best that he went and founded... It worked out well for him to go found Next, struggle to make next a thing and then have Next in Apple. I always call it a reunification rather than an acquisition because it really is so obvious. I mean, Craig Federighi's first job out of college was at Next and it's like he left for a while, right? Scott Forstall, but where Apple got lost in those years, one of the ways, and I think I haven't seen a lot of people or a lot of books focus on it, was the sort of mindset in the early PC years, a company would come out with a new computer and the computer was the platform effectively, and there wasn't really this idea, there wasn't so much of you'd make the Commodore 64 and then when Commodore came out with the Commodore 128, I forget if you could run Commodore 64 programs, but it was sort of a new computer. It was like, ah, this is a different computer. And then Commodore came out with Amiga is sort of an overlooked thing in history and I know the panic guys were big Amiga fans and the Amiga had the video toaster was doing digital video editing way before any other computer platform. It had some amazing capabilities, but Commodore just exemplifies it. Commodore 64 was a hit, then the 128 not so much of a hit, then the Amiga, which was way more capable. But that every couple of years the idea was there'd be like a new thing and backwards compatibility was like a maybe and it would be like a mode, but basically you'd sort of come out with an all new thing every couple years as opposed to evolving a platform over decades. It just didn't enter Apple's mind. And so Apple had all of these failed next generation, what's going to come after the Macintosh things in the late eighties and especially the early nineties, Pink and Taligent, and it's all confusing and it would take forever to explain as opposed to what was an operating system and what was a company and what was a cross-platform like? Taligent was sort of a cross company thing with IBM where it was in addition to an operating system, they'd make a new platform and the power PC chip architecture sort of came out of that. And so it wasn't totally futile, but the idea wasn't to how do we keep evolving the Macintosh? It was what comes after the Macintosh. That's the fundamental flaw. And the Newton is laughed at in some ways and other ways people are like, oh man, they're sort of a decade ahead of in terms of you'd have a handheld thing in your hand with a touchscreen, but the most obvious problem with the Newton was that something handheld that needs ubiquitous wireless networking. And there wasn't even Wi-Fi at the time, let alone cellular. Palm Pilot was sort of more of a hit, but mostly because it was affordable. And people like me, I had one, I had a handspring visor and I liked it. In hindsight, there's a lot of younger people who probably vaguely have heard of Palm Pilots, but it wasn't that big a deal. At the time, people are like, oh, the Palm Pilot is what Apple should have made with the Newton. No, because even the Palm Pilot really wasn't that big of a hit and it didn't have any staying power because it didn't do networking, it didn't have a connection to the internet, even Wi-Fi, let alone cellular. That's really what a handheld needed. But the other thing about the Newton that was just as important to its failure was it really hardly related to the Macintosh at all. There was a Newton, I forget what it's called, Newton Sink Utility or something, and you connect a serial cable to your Mac and Newton, you could sync some things, but like I said earlier, there was no contact app on the Mac from Apple. So where did your Newton contacts go? The Newton had a contacts app because it was a personal digital assistant and they had all of these things about what comes after the Macintosh when what they should have clearly been thinking of is how do we move the Macintosh forward? And meanwhile, while Apple's core interest and at the top level of the company was interested on these big expensive, all-failed next generation, what comes after the Macintosh? There were people at Apple who were grinding away on the Macintosh, putting out system seven and then system 7.1, system 7.5 and sort of keeping the company alive financially because that's an actual platform that people were using and buying. And I think at the highest level, Apple was looking at that the way that the Macintosh part of the company was looking at the Apple II in the eighties. And for most of those mid to late eighties, Apple was staying alive financially through Apple II sales, not Macintosh sales. And they were thinking, that's what the Macintosh is doing now and we will get pink or Copeland or whatever this thing is. Copeland was a next generation Mac. That was where they started to get it through their head that, oh, what we really need to do is keep the Mac alive and come up with something. They just wasted half a decade of great still explosive new stuff coming out. The whole internet thing happened in the midst of that where there was no internet to speak of. I mean, the internet existed, but it was like a university type thing in 1991 and by 1993, 4, 5, it was like, oh, Netscape is a huge thing. Meanwhile, Microsoft was doing the opposite with Windows where they're like Windows One, nobody used, nobody even heard of Windows Two, nobody used, nobody heard of. Windows Three, now people are using it instead of DOS, but it was really clunky and awful and they're like, let's make a better one. Let's make one that steals interface ideas from Next where the buttons and stuff look 3D and have gray scale. And they were grinding away on making the thing that was sort of a hit just a little better every couple years. And Apple just lost half a decade in that period. And thankfully they had people who were incrementally making the Macintosh better, but then they'd sort of painted themselves in a corner where the Macintosh operating system, not to get too super nerdy, but was still fundamentally based on some assumptions from the mid-eighties about how low level all software worked and the idea of preemptive multitasking where a program crashing couldn't possibly crash the whole computer because it would just be the program. Whereas the Macintosh was so low level and all programs sort of made some low level assumptions where they were, there was no kernel to speak of in computer science terms in that classic macOS. And they were doing things with low level memory where like, hey, if Internet Explorer froze up, your whole computer might just freeze. And then you had to literally use the power button on the hardware to restart it and anything you had open that wasn't saved was gone. In 1984, 85, 86, that's the way a computer like the Macintosh had to work. There was no option to do preemptive multitasking and have memory safe applications in that era because of the constraints of the hardware. But by 1995, 96, that was totally possible and it was obviously the way it should be, but there was no simple way to just say that's how the next version of macOS is going to work. And all of the existing apps like Photoshop and Excel and Microsoft Word will just work. There was no way. It was too incompatible. And that's what you were talking about earlier where Apple was up against it because the only reason the Macintosh was thriving was because of these apps from companies... And the big ones were Adobe and Microsoft, and if their existing apps didn't continue to work, there was no way anybody was going to upgrade to whatever they came up with no matter what its technical capabilities. David Barnard: And so then being back against the wall and Jobs having gone off to Next and built that next iteration, the Next revolution in computing the foundation for everything we do today was what Jobs built at Next, they acquired Next in 96 and Jobs comes back and then that's what leads up to this Microsoft committing to the platform, investing money into Apple. And then I wanted to read a quote, and this is going to be long, and those of you who really care can go back and watch. There's a video of this is that at WWDC in 1997. There's a quote from Jobs. A developer asked about OpenDoc, so I [inaudible 00:55:54] all this, but we can skip over the details of it because I think the details are less important, but Apple decided to kill this technology, OpenDoc and the developer very frustrated, goes up to the mic at WWDC during an open mic session with Steve Jobs at WWDC in 97. Very frustrated, why are you killing this thing? We've invested a lot of money into it and I want to read the quote. I kind of jump around in the quote because it would take 10 minutes to read, but let me read this quote from Steve Jobs because I think it's just so fascinating. "I know some of you spent a lot of time working on stuff that we put a bullet in the head of, I apologize, I feel your pain." I wanted to get that in there because can you imagine Apple in 2025 saying, I apologize, I feel your pain and just the rest of this is so good. John Gruber: I can imagine it, but it would be very surprising and I feel like that's exactly what they could use, but yes. David Barnard: Yeah, that's what we're going to get to and that's why I wanted these quotes. We'll come back to it maybe an hour from now when we get deeper into the iPhone stuff. So continuing, it's skipping around the quote, but "focusing is about saying no. Focusing is about saying no and you've got to say no, no, no. And when you say no, you off people. So you take your lumps and Apple has been taking their share of lumps for the past six months in a very unfair way, and it's been taking them like an adult, and I'm proud of that." Man, Steve Jobs off the cuff. I miss that. I miss that so much. "And the result of that focus is going to be some really great products where the total is much greater than the sum of the parts." So again, that's missing a lot of context. It's missing a lot of the actual quote. You can go back and watch the video. I'll put it in the show notes, but I just thought that was so fascinating that Apple in '97 was at this point that Steve Jobs of all people was there on stage answering this kind of question with a level of kind of humility and self-awareness that, "Hey, developers are so important. I feel your pain. I'm sorry, I apologize. But then also clearly talking to the future of like, hey, this is going to be hard, but we're building towards something." And they included that quote specifically from what you were alluding to is that in this forty-year history with developers, there have been moments like that where you see a more open Apple, a more contrite Apple, and that the success of the iPhone has really changed the way I feel like Apple does relate to developers and Apple has not had to take its lumps in a good 20 or 30 years and has not had that level of forthrightness and humility with developers when things do go sideways, and this is where I think Ben Thompson has said multiple times on different podcasts and articles he's written, I think some people inside Apple view this and maybe those three top execs who've been there this whole time and a lot of people inside Apple, it felt humiliating, not humble. And that this was a period in their history that they were so beholden to third-party developers and they never wanted to be in that position again. They never wanted to have to take lumps again. They never wanted to be on that verge of bankruptcy. They never wanted to feel that pain and be humiliated like that again versus I go back and I read this, I'm like, wow, what a great example of just how much goodwill do you instill in developers in the entire ecosystem by speaking like that to developers? John Gruber: The first thing I'll say to that is that of those three executives you've mentioned, Eddie Kew, Jaws, and Schiller. Schiller's the exception where Schiller, I know you probably know this, actually hasn't been in Apple continuously since 1987 or whatever, and in the early nineties he was, I forget where else, but he ended up at Macromedia, which was the company behind PageMaker, or maybe not... No, I forget, but they had... They were the competitor to Adobe, and so Schiller has been on the other side of that divide making the essential tools for the Mac. That just helps add to that same perspective though of knowing how much leverage those companies had over Apple. And the two things that were scarring to Apple were the near bankruptcy. And so it's made the company institutionally incredibly frugal and more so while Jaws was still alive, it was only after Jaws died and Cook took over that they started doing things like shareholder buybacks and stuff while Jaws was alive. They were just hoarding their profits. They just were putting it into that Braeburn Capital subsidiary and just sitting on an ever-growing mountain of cash because in the same way that my grandparents who had been through the Great Depression would eat, scrape every single bit of food off their plate and thought it was offensive, no matter whether you thought it tasted good or whether you were still hungry, it was offensive not to eat every bit of food offered to you because they remembered not having enough food and the parts of the company that remembered being on the verge of bankruptcy, in some ways it helps focus the company, but in some ways in the long run sort of hurt them. And I think having somebody new like Tim Cook, again, he's been there a long time, but he wasn't there for the near bankruptcy part or came in just after, and so he wasn't as scarred by it. But I think that developer relations part definitely has, now that Apple has gotten big, has hurt them. That they're still so thinking of themselves as underdogs who want to assert not dominance over developers from their perspective, but having at least 51% of the power over developers that they've lost the fact that they've actually got 95% of the power or however you want to assign the power dynamic in the current state. They're so hell-bent on making sure they never fall below 51% of the power between the platform and the developers that they've just lost sight of how overwhelmingly they've already won and how much it would be in their interest to make concessions because of the surplus of power that they have to bolster developer goodwill. I don't think we're putting them on a hypothetical psychiatrist couch, but they do remember it. It's infused their thinking about the company. David Barnard: And we will put a pin in that to come back to as we talk about the more modern era of lawsuits and regulation and everything else like that, but stepping back and walking through the history, you do see a different apple after that. And so Apple does go on to build keynote and pages and numbers and the whole digital hub and they start building more and more of those key pieces of software. I think in part from that scarred time of we want to make sure there's great software for the average user and we're going to bundle it even though that's in conflict with our third party developers. We're going to give things away free or cheap, and you see a different Apple in that early 2000 era of like, we're going to control our destiny. Third party developers are important. We're going to be a platform. We're going to encourage them, but we're going to cover our own bases. We're going to make sure that we're not beholden to these companies in the long run by doing these things. And then kind of the next era as I was going through all of this, and this is where I kind of step into it, is what I was calling the Delicious Era. And there were these at the time, going all the way back to the eighties, kind of smaller passionate developers, but I feel like the heyday of this passionate small developer time was those early 2000s. You had Delicious Monster Building, Delicious Library and Panic and the Omni Group and Rogue Amoeba, and you could probably... Bare Bones, you could probably list another 20 off the top of your head, and there was this kind of renaissance. The iPod started driving more and more people from Windows to the Mac. There were these really passionate kind of fanboy developers building these really cool software for the platform. And as a platform, I feel like there was a bit of a heyday during that time where Apple was kind of... And Sherlocking famously came out of the Watson Sherlock thing in, I think, that was 2020, but there was this kind of heyday leading up to the iPhone of really great independent software creators while at the same time Microsoft and Adobe and others were starting to invest more back into the platform and the Mac becomes this really solid platform in that era. John Gruber: It's a tough thing to strike a balance on. It's almost impossible to just get perfectly right where it's clearly correct for there to be a suite of fundamental apps out of the box in a factory fresh new computer or phone or tablet. And that therefore that 1990 to 1995 Apple mindset of we're hardly going to ship any first party apps and everything will be third party apps because we don't want to step on their toes. And even if we have a subsidiary that makes Mac Write and Mac Draw and stuff like that, or File Maker, we're going to put it in a subsidiary and try to treat it as best we can as an actual third party developer, even though we own the company. That's not the right way to deal with a platform, but obviously Sherlocking every successful app is also not the right mindset. It's a hard balance to strike, and I think they've managed it pretty well, especially... And again, in the early 2000s when Sherlocking first became a term, it was so few years since the era when Apple studiously avoided ever stepping on the toes of third party developers, that it felt like all of this was newly offensive. And here in 2025, that's sort of ancient history. And so people don't think of it that way. So for example, just this month at WWDC, they announced clipboard history management in Sherlock on macOS Tahoe and a sort of more launch bar, Alfred Ray cast style superpowers in Spotlight where you can assign a two letter abbreviation to something to launch a shortcut or something like that. I think that they continue to strike the right balance where I, as a long time launch bar user, I'm glad they're adding those features to Spotlight, but there's 0% chance that I'm switching to Spotlight. I have an example though where here's a market where I feel like they tried to stay away from third parties and I think it bit them and now they're entering late, which is password management. And OnePassword is a great app from a great company that used to make a really great Mac app for passwords, and they're still a good company and the app is still fine. I've never been a user of it, but I see why people are. But the dynamic is the more popular and successful OnePassword came, the more that grew and they grew in interest to want to reach the enterprise market. And that changed the product in a way that made it not so great as a Apple product, an Apple platform product. OnePassword is still a great product, super good at a technical level, super useful in that enterprise context and in terms of some of the family sharing and stuff like that. But it's like if you really want the Mac style interface for password integration and the iPhone style integration and the syncing between the two, it started becoming not as great as it used to be because their interest in growing their market, which is great for the company, were in conflict with making it perfect for the Apple platforms. And so Apple came out with Apple passwords I think last year. I think it's only been a year, maybe it's two years. David Barnard: I don't know. It's been... Well, I mean, the password app, but they've been kind slow rolling into building the password app. John Gruber: It was effectively an app worth more than an app, a serious app worth of capabilities and features, but hidden away in a system settings panel for years, I think out of deference to we don't want to squash this market. But then I think as the market sort of moved into a less and less idiomatic Apple platform style of software, they were like, you know what? We should just make our own app because we could do this in a way that's very Apple-y. And I think now the new passwords app, it's a good introduction to how do you make a modern app for Apple platforms? Any area where they try to stay out of, eventually they find themselves having to enter. David Barnard: Yeah, so this is a huge can of worms that we could spend an hour talking about the balance of Apple, what they ship and what they don't, and what developers' toes they step on and what they don't. Maybe this is a whole nother podcast, but I want to step back and- David Barnard: Maybe this is a whole another podcast. I wanted to step back and see if there was anything else you wanted to share relating to the 2000s in that. I feel like that era did actually set Apple up really well for the iPhone as a platform. The Cocoa frameworks, the passionate developer base, the books that were written. When I started working on iOS, I intended to be the programmer and do it all myself. And so I bought the famous book of the era, Aaron Hillegass, Cocoa frameworks or whatever it was. And so by the time you got to the iPhone, there was this really solid, passionate community. Books being written, conferences being attended. WWDC had grown tremendously, and this era of the 2000s of the Mac becoming this really great platform was a springboard that then propelled the iPhone even faster as a platform than I think it would've otherwise been. Is there anything else you wanted to talk about that era before we jump into the iPhone era? John Gruber: The basic mindset in the late '90s in the industry was a sort of consensus that user interface design doesn't matter that much. Nobody would argue it doesn't matter at all, but that Apple's focus on making it the top priority of their platforms wasn't worth it because, okay, let's just concede that the Mac was a better user interface than Windows. Look at their market share. Obviously it didn't matter. It wasn't an unreasonable conclusion, but I think it was wrong-headed because I think that the problem that people arguing that way didn't see yet was that no computer. Again, it comes back to that argument that the iPhone is truly the first real personal computer, the one that every person would want and would care about. At the time, even in the late '90s, too many people making decisions about what computers to buy or what computers a company should buy weren't the people who care that much about user interface and therefore they were buying Windows PCs based on other criteria. Those early 2000s that built up this skill set in designers and developers and built up these teams of either companies or independents or just hobbyists, but at every level who could make software that was like, oh man, just look at it. Remember the Disco app. It was a DVD burning utility. When it burned the DVD, it actually had smoke come out of the window. Some people were like, well, that's just a complete waste of CPU and GPU resources, and other people were like, where do I buy this? I want to buy this because when I burn a CD or DVD, I want smoke to come out of the window because that's just cool and fun. This whole skill set was there for Apple and in 2008 when the app store opened up to build apps that people would just be like, but just look at it. Just look at this. Oh yeah, where do I get that app? I want to get it. It fueled this consumer fervor for the platform that no other platform could even hope to compete with at the time. There was no other platform. Early Android, they just couldn't do it. Microsoft's mobile, Blackberry, whatever. Nobody had the skill set. It was impossible to make anything that was like, just look at it. Just look at this app. Look how cool it looks. David Barnard: Yeah. I hadn't thought about it from that. The design perspective as well. I mean, that's what brought me to iPhone development. We'll move into the iPhone era now, is that I was that uber passionate Apple fanboy, Mac nerd. I had my, I don't even know what it was at the time, in 2007, some PowerBook that I had at the time. I loved the software, I loved the platform. I was first person, not first person in line. Well, I was first person in line to buy an iPhone. I was in line. Again, if you weren't around and weren't a fanboy at the time, it's laughable to think about this at the time, but I stood in line for, I think it was my iOS, Mac OS Tiger or one of those. There would be lines at the Apple Store and OS Update was a launch event. John Gruber: You had to pay $129 for it. David Barnard: Yes. You would line up to pay $120 to upgrade your operating system. It was that passion about the platform at that time that you had people like me and millions of us around the country who cared so deeply about the platform for all of these reasons is that it wasn't just good hardware, it wasn't just the OS, but it was this combination of OS and fun software and delightful, but it was productive. In 2003, I actually bought that 17 inch PowerBook because I was using Photoshop to manipulate this aerial photography for my dad's commercial real estate business. The Windows laptop I was on kept crashing. I was like, dad, I got to get a Mac if you want me to keep working on this stuff. Went and paid for it. The experience was night and day working on Photoshop on a 17-inch PowerBook than it was whatever crappy Windows machine I was using at the time. And so there was this fervor for the platform in that time that I think was the perfect setup. And also coming into the iPhone, there was enough of that groundswell of people like me. I was in China when Apple announced the iPhone. I went to the internet cafe at a Beijing hotel to watch a live blog of the Macworld keynote that you were at when they announced the original iPhone because there was just that level of fervor. And then six months later, my brother and I go get in line to buy the first iPhone. There was that passion, and then by the time they announced the SDK that next year, I jumped into it because I thought this is going to be something. I saw something different about the platform, and so much of that had been built up through Apple's experience across the decades building platforms of the turnaround of the Mac, of building the foundations with Cocoa and stuff like that. That ended up becoming the iPhone. And then by the time the iPhone App Store was released, there was this groundswell of developers who were just so excited about the platform. They could not build an app for this platform. It wasn't just original Mac developers. That was one of the fascinating things, you alluded to it earlier, is that a lot of the Mac developers didn't really do well on the iPhone because they were maybe a little too caught up in what they had built for the Mac. What we saw happen when the App Store launched with so many new companies being built, new ideas being explored, and just this fervor for building for the platform. John Gruber: There was a skill set that transferred immediately where somebody who is really fluent as a developer in Objective-C and the AppKit APIs on the Mac could immediately jump over, because it was just more limited. It was like AppKit but a lot more limited. But in terms of the syntax and the style of the APIs, they could just jump right in and thrive in a way that a developer who's familiar with Java at the time, which was super popular, or the Windows C++ APIs was like, what the hell's going on here with all the square brackets? But in terms of the concepts for what an app should be and do in the scope of it, it wasn't a mini Mac. It still isn't, but especially in 2008, 2009, it just was so much more limited and the context of where and how people would use it was so different that it just at a conceptual level be thinking in a very different way, not quite as profound. But along the lines of the difference between the purely command line interfaces of the early PC era where you just had text on a screen versus a graphical user interface. It was the same difference where it was like, hey, people are just going to sometimes open your app and want to use it like tap, tap done and get out. You could have Mac apps at the time where you'd launch the app and it would show a splash screen. It was a whole term of art like, Photoshop and Adobe apps famously would take 30, 40 seconds to launch because they were such big apps. Well, that made no sense on the iPhone. If you had that mindset like, I have this idea for an app, but it's going to take 20 seconds to launch, well, people would just be like, nah, screw this. I'm hitting the home button and deleting the app before it finished launching. David Barnard: To bring back the developer relations thread, WWDC 2008, which you were at, one of my big regrets in life is not going to WWDC 2008 because I founded my company April of that year to build iPhone apps. I had borrowed money from my family. I felt this tension of am I spending my family's hard-earned money that they've invested in me to go on a vacation to San Francisco to this developer conference? And so I did not go. What I heard in retrospect was that they were actually signing up developer accounts in person at WWDC that year. Could have been there day one had I gone, but this was the first time WWDC ever sold out. I've heard stories about past WWDC. They would be giving away tickets. They would be begging developers to come, and at WWDC 2008 was the first time it sold out. And then from then on, that groundswell of developer and the platform becoming so powerful, they never again had to ask developers to come. It was sold out every year after that, eventually having to go to a lottery. And then there's one more point I wanted to make was that at WWDC 2008, the slides from the presentations had the email addresses of Apple evangelists on the slide because they're like, hey, email us. We need more feedback. We want to know what's going on. Even as successful as the Mac platform had become, this was still pre iPhone Apple and pre the iPhone platform becoming what it became was such a different Apple. Funny story, because I had not gotten a developer account, I sent an email to five of the people- John Gruber: On the slides. David Barnard: On the slides. John Galenzi of all people responded to the email, gave me a phone call. I mean, to this day I remember he actually just retired from Apple. I had a lovely chat with him a couple of weeks ago at WWDC on the side because he's no longer at Apple anymore. John Gruber: No, he's no longer at Apple, but I saw him at WWDC. David Barnard: Yeah. Such an incredible human. But evangelists would put their email on the slides. It's just hard in 2025 how secretive, how close, how we choose you, you don't choose us. How hard it is to get the attention of Apple for the average developer. That was the era before the iPhone platform became so big. John Gruber: It was clearly a surprise to Apple. The whole idea that jobs had to be talked into opening up an API. I think that's overstated a little to some degree. I was going to say how much of that was just him blustering? Well, the difference is between should there be third-party apps for iPhone versus should the iPod support Windows. Now, Jobs wholeheartedly was against supporting Windows. He really was 100% on board with the iPod as a thing to help sell the Mac. Making it a Mac-only peripheral was in Apple's interest because it would bolster the Mac and every other executive from Schiller to whoever else was like, we're holding back the iPod as a platform by not supporting Windows. There's multiple books that he have written about it where he's like, all right, fine, go do it, but don't bother me. I don't want to know about it. And then he called it the iTunes for Windows, the Glass of ice water in hell. He was happy once it came out and he could see it and he could say that, he was happy, but he was really against it. I don't think he was against opening the iPhone, I just think he thought someday. I do think that maybe it happened a little faster than he thought. I don't think he anticipated announcing it in 2007. In fact, at 2007, WWDC was when they announced their "sweet solution" for third party developers, which was a very small JavaScript library where you could make some web apps that looked like native iPhone apps. They wouldn't have announced that in June on the cusp of the iPhone going on sale if they really thought, hey, we're going to have a native SDK early next year. It was September, October where they just made an announcement like, sure, all right, fine. We heard you. We're going to open an SDK. Give us a couple of months to get it together. We'll get back to you when it's ready. I think he thought it was like, we'll get to it in a couple of years, but I think it already was proving more popular and more resonant than he thought. I think Jobs and everybody at Apple knew this iPhone was a hit. They knew it was a thing. They weren't surprised that it was in sensation when they announced it, but it was even more resonant and more of a hit and bled out to more normal people. The iPhone first came out in 2007, right away in the summer of 2007, I'd be at Whole Foods and I'd have a shopping list in a Web App and Randos would just come up to me and be like, is that an iPhone? Is that an iPhone. All the time. I don't think Apple was anticipating that level of broad consumer appeal and it accelerated that. The WWDC thing is a perfect example. Before the iPhone, they had a whole extra track at WWDC. They called it the IT Track for IT professionals who managed Mac installations in corporate environments. It was because they had room, I don't know, I'm just ball parking, 3000 developers, but then 2000 IT professionals and a whole different track of sessions where instead of talking about APIs for making Mac Apps, it was sessions related to the very serious, a reasonable topic for a conference, but it was almost like two conferences in one. One for developers and one for IT professionals, just because they wanted to fill up Moscone and they had room. With the iPhone, it was like, oh, we got to get rid of that. There was this whole resentment because, it was I think a very good and successful and popular conference for IT professionals, but when the popularity of the iPhone happened, it was like, oh, they got to go. And then it became, even Mac developers felt like, hey, this used to be all about the Mac and now it's session after session after session is just about the iPhone. David Barnard: We've talked about a lot of things that are ultimately almost a fluke of history that things played out the way they did from Bill Gates saving Apple and all those things. I can't help but think. I wish I could remember their names to give them credit for it, but very soon after the iPhone was released, the developers jailbroke the iPhone and started writing native apps for it. Craig Hockenberry is one name I will call out. I wonder if that jailbreak scene and seeing what developers were building under insane constraints. Because when you jailbroke, Apple hadn't documented APIs. It wasn't a real SDK. Developers were having to reverse engineer methods they could call and how things were working. I can't help but think that some of jobs changing his mind so quickly was because of how innovative and how passionate that base was. I mean, I ended up buying it. When I started my company, I bought a second iPhone because I was too nervous to jailbreak my own iPhone. I bought a second iPhone, jailbroke it and installed all these apps for me as a way to study what apps could do. It's like you could study as a developer in 2008 before the App Store was launched and you had 500 apps to poke around to see what people were doing. I jailbroke a phone specifically to understand what could be done and what people were doing and what was going on with the platform. I can't help but think that Hockenberry and Steve Troughton-Smith and some of those other early jailbreak folks had an influence on the SDK actually coming out as quickly as it did. John Gruber: Yeah. I think Jobs appreciated that. Lucas Newman, who was at the Luscious library at the time and then went to Apple. I think it got him hired by Apple. I haven't heard from him in a while. I also know that, I think this is a public story, but Lucas Newman wrote the first game. It was called Lights Off, wholly backwards engineered, entirely. Hockenberry came out with a version of Twitterrific that was a native app before the year was out without any SDK from Apple, but building apps for the iPhone through Xcode. Just bananas to me that this happened. But I think Jobs appreciated that mindset because of all the crazy nonsense him and Woz had done back in the day before they founded was. Before they founded Apple making the little blue boxes that would let you make free long-distance calls on a payphone and stuff. The enthusiasm was just so much stronger where it was like they'd be crazy not to hold it back. David Barnard: Then March 6th, 2008 a date seared into my memory, they announced the iPhone SDK. This is again where I think people in 2025 don't appreciate what a different era that was in terms of what was possible as a developer to build a business. I wrote a business investment thesis that I sent to my dad and mom and uncle who ultimately invested in the company. I specifically wrote in there, what an incredible deal this is that I don't have to host my own store. Because back then, I mean, again, so easy to forget in this era of Stripe and AWS back ends and everything like that, that standing up your own web server to distribute apps, especially if it's a larger app, could get very expensive. Bandwidth was expensive. Working with third-party, payment platforms was a hassle. You needed a whole team to sort all that stuff out. And so when Apple announced the iPhone- John Gruber: Especially on a phone, right? David Barnard: Yeah. John Gruber: Credit card would be even harder. There was no way to scan it, no tap to pay. David Barnard: The only software that was on phones at the time was carrier build. You had to do a deal with a carrier and they took 50% of everything. The App Store was genuinely a revolution in software of a revolution of opportunity for developer. I mean, this is what I built my career on. This is why I have such a soft place in my heart and I'm so obsessed to this day with the App Store because it just fundamentally changed the opportunity you had as a developer to build a business. Of course that's not true anymore in 2025 with Stripe and hosted Back ends and Bandwidth being essentially free and all these third-party SaaS tools that you could spin up a Web App. I mean, geez, now even in Vibe coding where you don't even need a backend or hardly any experience to spin up a Web App that's just hosted on Replit. You can charge for it via built-in payment solutions. It's just crazy how much different the world is today than it was for that original App Store release. I think people today forget just how powerful that was. We were talking about this before we hit record trying to do the math. There are kids today, teenagers releasing apps on the App Store whose parents probably weren't even alive when Schiller and Cue and Joswiak joined Apple in the '80s. You could be a 16-year-old developer with a 40-year-old parent who wasn't even alive when all of this started with the Macintosh in 1984, much less 1976 when Apple was founded. I think there is a little bit of a loss of history and then maybe at Apple a little too much recognition of history of here we are in 2025 and the world has completely changed. The iPhone helped change the world 17 years ago, but now it's been 17 years since the world changed. People today looking from the outside without this history, I don't think appreciate the things that Apple appreciates. They don't have the context and the history. I think when you're trying to understand how Apple operates, why they're so insistent on the App Store fees and other things like that, you have to ignore all of that history, which to people's credit they don't even know. That's why we're doing this podcast. To understand Apple, you have to go back those 40 years and see all of what it took to get to the iPhone and then the iPhone becoming the platform it is and the billions and trillions of dollars that the platform has generated for third-party developers, that's hard not to just appreciate. John Gruber: To some extent at this point, it's becoming clear that Apple itself has fallen into the same trap. I'll exemplify it with a quote. I've been thinking about this a lot. I'm hopefully going to soon turn it into some article on Daring Fireball. There's a Steve Jobs quote. It's actually, Apple's made a big plaque of it, huge. It's, I don't know, 10 feet diagonal. It hangs not at Apple Park, but outside the Town Hall Theatre at the old Infinite Loop campus. The quote is, if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what's next. I think with the App Store in particular, boy that really resonate. It's not that they should forgo all profit and all commissions from the App Store, the whole, well, we started with 70/30. We should stick with 70/30. We've never raised it from 70/30 even when it's become more powerful or more monopoly, whatever you want to call it. David Barnard: As they've increased in control and the platform has increased in importance, they could have increased and squeezed and other things. John Gruber: Right. The people at Apple who are insisting on keeping as much of the commission's and the rules and everything as they have, but especially when it comes to payments and letting people link out to the web and stuff like that. They're thinking, hey, we built this thing that was so much more generous and developer friendly than everything that came before it on handhelds or, especially on phones. That they're still caught up in thinking of what it was in 2008 as opposed to that Jobs's quote, if you build something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. I feel like Apple is dwelling on the success and the innovation, true innovation, profound innovation that absolutely shook up and completely revolutionized the phone industry more than Apple even revolutionized the PC industry, but they're dwelling on it for too long. That they should move on and build something else new and start conceding on that issue. I think it is something that they've lost when they lost Steve Jobs. People think that they lost the ability to make new things, that it was always his ability to drive them to make a new thing. But I think he was good at, okay, fine. Again, I mentioned that whole iPod for Windows thing where he stuck with it for a year or two and then he was like, okay, fine, fine. At some point the people holding onto all of these rules and healing all these decisions about the anti-steering and stuff. Somebody at the top named Tim Cook should probably just say, okay, fine, fine. Let's just give in on a lot of this. We don't have to worry about it anymore. Just clear it off our concerns. I think it would be so good for Apple to just clear it off the table and just clear their time and their energy and their talent from executives down to engineers to just figure out what's next and make something new that would build into something where they have to worry about this again in 10 or 15 years. David Barnard: I want to dig into what I will affectionately call App Store 3.0 because I completely agree, but let's step back one more point in history. I have a bunch of notes. We could go through all of the early iPhone days. It's hard for people who don't even know that there weren't in-app purchases, that you had paid upgrades. That in order to do a paid upgrade, you had to release a whole new app and then transition users to it. There's so many points on the App Store history of just oddities and stubbornness and weird things that Apple did in those early days, even as the platform started taking off. But in 2016, Phil Schiller did a round of interviews. I think the one that most concisely covers it, maybe the one he gave the most access to was Verge. They titled the article App Store 2.0. And so in hindsight now I will give this way more credit than I think I did at the time of, it really was App Store 2.0. It really did fuel what we see as the current era of the platform. They open up subscriptions to all apps, which obviously working at RevenueCat and now all my apps are subscription. I know some users still bulk at it, but from a developer's perspective and being able to fund the creation of great software and continue working on it, that was revolution. That was App Store 2.0 to empower developers to better monetize apps. They sped up app review significantly. Again, if you weren't around a decade ago, you don't remember the days when it was seven days, 14 days to get an app through App Review. As much as you might complain about App Review today, at least you get that rejection in 24 hours to 48 hours instead of seven to 14 business days. They dropped the commission to 15% on year one renewal. If you started a subscription, that first commission would be 30, and then after that would be 15%. They announced App Store search ads as a new way to pay to get users. As much as we can complain about name squatting and having to pay to defend your brand, it's an incredible opportunity to be able to pay and get in front of people right there in the App Store. It's actually the paid acquisition channel that I recommend any App Store with. If you're struggling to get downloads, the first thing you should do is start figuring App Store search ads. That was App Store 2.0. They started removing a lot of these old apps that weren't working or just crappy apps. They started to purge the App Store and curate it a little bit more. That was App Store 2.0 in 2016. Looking back now almost a decade since. It really was a profound shift in the App Store that has led to so much of what we now get to experience as the App Store would not have happened had they not loosened the reins in those ways and made those changes. And so as much as we talk about, I complain on Twitter about Apple being obstinate and not changing and being stuck in the past and everything like that. The App Store 2.0 was them changing. Did they go on an apology tour? Did they, whatever? No. But they made very fundamental changes to the App Store that propelled it for this last decade. To your point, this is what I want to get back to today in 2025, is that it really does feel like we are in need of App Store 3.0, a deeper, more fundamental rethink of the opportunity. I think to your point, get out of the way. Let developers build. I think the Vision Pro is a good example too of the animosity that has started to build up. The frustrations and everything has gotten to a point where developers are way more wary of Apple. You posted some really great posts this spring, Apple, you're killing my vibe, and then another one by John Siracusa, just about developers seeing Apple more and more as a inconvenience to reaching their users versus a partner in building this incredible platform. The iPhone continues to sell like hotcakes. Apps are making money hand over fist. Developers are building apps, new apps every day. From the outside and looking at the numbers, maybe the platform is fine, but I think this sentiment where developer relations are in 2025 with the lawsuits, with the DMA, with all of the things that are going on, it feels like we're due another reset. Personally, I would love to that be a little bit more like the '97 jobs of like, hey, we did some things that we thought were right at the time and the forthrightness to say, here's why we think this. Here's why we did it. We're changing our mind. We're going to focus on building these great platforms moving forward. What does Apple need for the next decade and the decade after a vibrant developer community who's going to jump on the next day AI platform. Meta and Google and OpenAI and others are tromping at the bit and have billions of dollars to invest to not let this next platform play out the way the smartphone platform played out with Apple having so much control and so much power, maybe it's time for a bigger change. John Gruber: It's just proven so lucrative and forms the backbone of their services, "services that they report financially," which has been their growth vector for the last, I don't know, seven or eight years. Not because interest in the iPhone has decreased, but because clearly the iPhone is literally so popular that every single person in the world who lives somewhere where the iPhone is available and they can afford one and they want one has one. It's that popular that it has peaked because they've run out of people to sell it to. To their credit, it's part of the appeal that they build them to last. That's good for the environment. It's good as just a message that they're durable and the silicon is so good that five, six-year-old iPhones are still very credible devices. I'm running iOS 26 on an iPad from 2018, iPad Pro. It is a little slow. That's a seven-year-old device. The "services" has been their growth for the last seven or eight years. A lot of that comes not, they would like you to think that it's from Apple services, from people paying for iCloud and paying for Apple TV+ and whatever else they sell as a service. But a lot of it comes from their commission from the App Store, but they could decrease their cut and they could open up instead of fighting for these anti-steering things, especially going to the web stuff, which I've been against for years and years. I mean, pretty much ever since it became an issue that this is ridiculous. Especially like in the Kindle exemplifies it. That if the terms of the App Store are such that the Kindle App cannot sell app or books in the app without losing money on each book, which is the way the e-book publishing industry works, where there's a 70/30 split between the bookseller and the publisher and therefore if there's a 70/30 split between the publisher and the platform, they literally lose money on each sale that they'd owe. A $10 book, they would owe $3 to Apple, but they would owe $7 to the publisher and therefore at best would make nothing, so why do it? If you can't sell books through the app because of the terms of your store, you should absolutely let them have a button that says, go here to go buy books on the Kindle website. The idea that they fought that is, it's just absurd, and clearly anti-user. It just exemplifies how they've gotten caught up in thinking way too much that the point of the App Store is for Apple to get a commission on all digital content sales for the platform as opposed to what it should be and could be and should remain going forward, which is... John Gruber: ... could be and should remain going forward which is us maintaining control and having approval over the software and the APIs and what can happen in the background and how things are managed and how privacy is managed in the sandbox and everything is the best for the platform long-term and very much the best interest of the users. It should be that thinking. And then, the fact that we make a lot of money but maybe not as much money for all digital content on the platform because we do have and one of the ways you can do in-app purchases should be icing on the cake, which is clearly how they thought of it at the outset and they should just go back to thinking that. And I really do think that if and when they do, and I think it's a big if, but... And not at the point of regulation. Because if it's at the point of regulation, we see it. They're just going to make it convoluted and complex and the only way this knot is going to get untied is for Apple to willingly say, "You know what? We're going to lower the rate to 80-20 for everyone and 90-10 for small business," or something like that, "And we're going to just drop... If you want to send people outside the app to the web to make the purchases, just give them a button and they'll go to the web to do it." If they did that, I honestly think they would not see a significant decrease. And I think we're going to see that proved out in the coming months and quarters as Apple releases their quarterly finance statements after the recent ruling here in the US, their biggest market, that allows stuff like that. I don't think we're going to see a decrease in services revenue, now that they've been forced to open this up. So why not just open it up worldwide and make it easier for everyone and stop hanging the sword of Damocles over everybody that, "Hey, if we win an appeal in a year or two, we're going to revoke this access that you've now gotten at the point of Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers' legal declaration." It's better for the platform. Just make people happy. Make developers happy and users happy and Apple will profit from it. They really will. David Barnard: It does seem like dropping the fee would be a huge change in developer relations, in developer sentiment. I would hope they would go all the way down to 85-15 and I think there's Ben Thompson- John Gruber: And maybe something different for games maybe because- David Barnard: Yeah. That's what I was going to say. Yeah. Maybe games stay at 70-30 because that's what Sony and Nintendo and Steam and everybody else charges. Except for Epic with their App Store, but they obviously have reasons to artificially put that lower. But I can't help but think it would change the tone with the industry more broadly and be more in line with the reality of 2025. Now, you can argue, well, you're not just paying for payment fees. I think that's a disingenuous argument that a lot of people make. It's like, "Oh, Stripe is 3%. Why should we be paying Apple 30% for payments?" Well, you're not paying Apple 30% for payments and this is the argument Apple continues to make is that it's a platform fee. But there's a couple of things in there. One, it's almost a fluke of history that Jobs, in that original iPhone announcement said, "Hey, if you have a free app, we're going to distribute it for free and it doesn't cost you anything." And at the time, that was great and that created companies like Facebook and Uber and others where they might not have been able to make it work. Well, Facebook is a bad example because they were already reasonably profitable, but the iPhone certainly did springboard them even further. John Gruber: Yeah. But I would argue that the company is... It's not just that they adjusted and adapted to mobile. Meta, today, is unrecognizable from the Facebook of 2007. And in hindsight, they were clearly meant for mobile. To the point where they've got products that people use entirely on mobile, right? You can technically use Instagram on the web, but the vast majority of Instagram users have never once used it on the web. David Barnard: But would Instagram exist as it is today if they had to pay 50 cents per download or had to pay per user? John Gruber: Right, right. It is a quirk that Apple... Because Apple was coming at it from the mindset of the way the Mac worked. That there were free apps, but that any company that wanted to run the business from the app would be selling copies of the app. You'd buy the app before you installed it and that was Apple's mindset. And again, they were selling copies of their operating system at the time. If you bought a Mac that had Mac OS 10.2 installed and wanted to upgrade to 10.3, it cost $129 and it cost 100 some dollars or I don't even know what it cost to get Pages and Numbers and Keynote. All of that stuff was for sale for what would, today, strike people as bananas amounts of money and that was their thinking of how software would be sold. And I think the idea of a company and... Meta exemplifies it. That a company, like one of the five biggest companies in the world purely making software... Well, I mean I know they have got the glasses and stuff now too. But like Microsoft, primarily a software company, would be making all their money by giving apps away and only having ads in the app? It just didn't compute at the time and they never foresaw that... It's sort of a loophole. And if it costs them 50 cents a download per user per year, they could afford that very easily. David Barnard: They could. But then, would Instagram have been created? So many companies who have been built on top of it, could they have done it? But in 2025, when you look at the state of the world of Airbnb making billions of dollars, Uber making billions of dollars, Meta making billions of dollars, Google making billions of dollars on the iOS platform and not having to pay a penny other than $100 a year developer account. And here I am, indie developer supporting my family. I've paid Apple over a million dollars. I think closing in on $2 million in my 17-year history. Is that fair? And in the world of 2025, that just seems bananas like, "Why have I paid Apple $2 million for my dinky little indie apps and Meta has paid Apple $100 a year for 17 years?" It's bizarre. If you erase 40 years of history, if you erase all the context that we've built up to this point, and you just look at it as a logical person in 2025, that just seems bananas that I am paying so much to Apple and Meta is paying zero. John Gruber: I do think that was some of the thinking behind the core technology fee for the EU DMA compliance plan where it was sort of like, "What would we do if we did it all over again?" And I think that 50 cents per user per year fee for million plus download apps only was sort of thinking this is what they would do all over again. But the irony of that is that they're even walking away from that now, because the EU has said that the CTF is not compliant with the DMA. So they're switching to a core technology fee or commission which, again, is only on in-app purchases. So again, if you have a super popular app like Instagram that you can use without ever making a digital goods transaction through it, Apple makes nothing but the $100 a year developer fee. I do think they are thinking of it and they tried. The CTF was sort of their attempt but it is sort of a tricky position. But I think the answer to that is, "Hey, maybe you should just be happy that you own this platform and not worry about how much money you make from it," and, again, like that Steve Jobs quote. And just make something else wonderful and go on and really refocus on getting developers to say, "If I didn't have to answer to my boss or what I'm telling my boss and manager, I think we should do is put our efforts into making awesome software for these Apple platforms." To get that developer enthusiasm back I think is worth more to the company than whatever money they're making by breeding pure resentment with the current policy. And I don't want to let it slide, because you mentioned it but I want to emphasize it, that one of those differences between visionOS today and the original Mac in 1984, 1985 at this point based on where we are in visionOS's life, is that even though the Mac wasn't popular in 1985, there was this blossoming ecosystem of Native Mac software, even though the market share wasn't there. Because of the enthusiasm developers had who were like, "Oh my god. People..." It just clicked in their heads like, "This is the computer of the future. I want to make software for it." And we're not seeing that for Vision. We really aren't. There are cool apps and it's not a dead platform but it's nowhere near... visionOS today is nowhere near as vibrant a third party developer ecosystem as the Mac was in 1985 or 1986. And I think that should be the red flag for Apple and I think they might be a little surprised by that. I don't think they're surprised by the number of Vision Pro headsets they've sold, but I think they are a little disappointed and surprised by the lack of developer enthusiasm for the platform. And I think it's entirely because developers are so resentful of the way that Apple has treated them, specifically around finance and payments, that sort of thing. We can argue about the rules on background processing and stuff like that in sandboxing and stuff that apps would like to do. But it's really the resentment... First and foremost, numbers one, two, and three on the list of reasons why developer relations are strained with Apple has to do with money. Anybody who says otherwise is wrong. And Apple doesn't need money. Again, they are not operating on narrow profit margins. Their profit margins have gone up, not down. David Barnard: This is the tricky point though and this is me listening to too much Ben Thompson, but the tricky thing for Apple at this stage though is that the services revenue is so important to the growth narrative around the stock. That even though they don't need the money, they need the money to continue growing the stock at the pace it's growing. And that's the rock and a hard place that they've gotten themselves into is that the services narrative is so strong and that quarter-over-quarter growth in services revenue and services profit when the hardware has kind of started to flatline a little bit- John Gruber: I don't want to interrupt you. But it's like the Exxon Mobil's of the world ran into this problem when they were on top of this market cap lists where it's like, "Well, how many more cars and motorcycles and airplanes consuming fossil fuels could we have, right?" It's like everybody who could have one had one and they're not going to make cars that purposefully consume more fuel. There comes a point where a product or a service or a category really does max out in terms of human population and it's a good place to be. But if your mindset as a Wall Street investor is growth, growth, growth, how much more could they grow, right? David Barnard: Yeah. And maybe this is where we need to go back to this Steve quote from 1997 and maybe the message is as much to Wall Street as it is to developers and Apple saying to Wall Street, "We're going to need to take some lumps, potentially like you and I have said, I mean, if they dropped the fee to 15%, would they lose money? Maybe, but maybe Netflix would come back to the App Store. Maybe... In my job at RevenueCat, I talk to so many developers who are just, "Web, web, web, web, web. We're trying to push as much as we can to the web. We're going to experiment with pushing out of the app into the web now because it's more profitable. We want to save on that 30%." And so, if they drop the fee and it just didn't even make sense to charge on the web. Because at RevenueCat, we did some experiments and Netflix did some experiments with Apple, early in the Epic case, I think it came out that their number was somewhere around that like 12 to 13%. Where if the fee had been dropped that low, it would still be more profitable to operate in the App Store than outside the App Store. And then, there's a lot of complicating factors now too of owning the relationship and would Netflix want Apple to be an intermediary? Well, guess what? If Apple were a more friendly intermediary, maybe they wouldn't mind so much and they would just pick the one that was more profitable on the dollar for dollar basis. John Gruber: We know it's a solvable problem because there are more platforms for signing up customers that give the owner of the service, the newsletter, the streaming service, the music service, whatever it is, more direct relationship with their customers. We've seen them built, so Apple could obviously build one into the App Store. Instead of making all these entitlements over linkouts and stuff like that make it an entitlement where you kind of have to qualify and have these restrictions on, "Well, do you have a customer service department? What's your refund policy? We're going to enforce that you have a customer friendly refund policy where you don't have to call a 1-800 number and listen to somebody try to talk you out of unsubscribing. We're going to test it. That's part of app review, where it has to be as easy to unsubscribe as to subscribe. Otherwise, we will pull your entitlement." But then, if you qualify on those terms and you have those policies in place, you can have more of a direct relationship with your customers. Do whatever it takes to make developers happy to be building for the Apple platforms. Instead, they're clearly focusing on, how can we extract a decent enough portion of the revenue that's conducted on these platforms? David Barnard: Yeah. And so, taking liberties with the Steve Jobs quote from '97, "Apple's going to need to take some lumps in the coming months, but we're going to take it like an adult and I'm proud of that. And the result of that focus, focusing more on developers and building a fantastic platform over extracting as much revenue as we can from that platform, we and third party developers are going to build some really great products where the total is much greater than the sum of the parts." I shitpost on Twitter about Apple all the time and I know a lot of people inside Apple don't like me for some of those posts. But what I care about deeply is this App Store platform- John Gruber: Join the club. David Barnard: Yeah. You recently. It's that you and I care unreasonably about this platform. On an earlier podcast with Ben Thompson, I love this quote from him, he said, "It just breaks my teenage heart to see Apple continuing down this path that it's going on." And I think that you and I both have gotten to this level of frustration with developer relations and what Apple's doing and the way they're operating. Not because we hate Apple and want to see them fail. And not because we're just take joy in ridiculing them or complaining and criticizing them publicly. It's just that we care so deeply and we see the path that they're on and we don't think it's right. And if you take these 40 years of history, you can kind of justify things and you can see how internally they can justify it and see it this way and see it that way. John Gruber: Somehow, they've gotten attached to this income that they've extracted from commissions in the App Store in a way that they've never been attached to other things. I mean, you and I mentioned this during this podcast about the upgrade charge they used to charge for operating systems, $129 to go from Mac OS 10.3 to 10.4. They used to charge $5 to upgrade iOS. They clearly, at that time, were trying to get away from it, but they thought the accounting rules they were trying to follow required them to do it. They've given up on that knowing that it was better for them overall. In theory, you think, "Well, why would you ever... If people were doing it and lining up outside Apple stores to buy boxed versions of the software for $129 to upgrade their existing Mac, why would you ever do away with that if it was so popular that they were lining up?" But in the grand scheme of things, it clearly was the right decision to just make the operating system upgrades free to encourage all users to upgrade and to sort of steer them towards automatic updates, because they can do that because they're not charging. They couldn't do the automatic OS updates that most people, with their default settings on a Mac or iPad or iPhone, just at some point a couple months after the dot O, there's a version they think is stable enough. And overnight, while your phone's charging, you get the new... You're going to have iOS 26 in November or December this year. And they can only do that because they're not charging for it and it's better for them overall. Obviously, they've never made more money, their profits and revenue are at record highs. I think the same thing is true of the commissions in the App Store that, yes, at some level, if you're the CFO at Apple, you're like, "Well, why in the world would we ever decrease this? If we don't legally have to, why would we ever give up a penny of it? It's a lot of money." But it'll all work out in the end in terms of... And Joz himself has mentioned this in multiple of the interviews he did do last month at WWDC. He said the same thing to me and it was an off the record briefing I had with him and it was very cordial and nice. I am sure he won't mind me repeating it because he mentioned it on the record with Joanna Stern and multiple people where one of the things Steve Jobs often said, "If we make great products and tell people about them," that's the marketing part from his perspective, "tell them why they're great, it'll all work out in the end." That's just as true of the App Store as anything else, but it's this one area where they've got a compulsive institutional obsession with squeezing it that they do not need. David Barnard: And speaking of flukes of history, one of the... I think it was an epic case found an email from Schiller to Jobs saying, "What if we cap App Store revenue to Apple at $100 dollars?" Which at the time seemed- John Gruber: No, I think it was a billion. I think it was a billion- David Barnard: Was a billion? Okay. John Gruber: I think it was a billion. David Barnard: Or even a billion. It was like at the point in time when he wrote that, it probably sounded crazy like, "How will we ever make that much money on the App Store?" But then now, in hindsight it's like, "Oh my gosh. That's such a tiny amount to what they're making now." But had Jobs been convinced of that and had they announced publicly, "We're going to cap Apple's revenue on the App Store-" John Gruber: Or even if they never announced it publicly, David Barnard: Right. It became internal policy. John Gruber: Yeah. And that once it hit a billion, they dropped it to 75-25 and it stayed at a billion and it was growing some more and then they could drop it to 80-20. Then eventually, 85-15. Who knows? By now, they'd probably be at 90-10 or 93-7 or something like that. And at certain level then without ever having announced that, they could stop. If it had ever gotten even to 90-10, they could stop and say, "Well, now, we can just sort of let it grow because 10 is pretty fair." And yes, it's not the 2.7% Stripe takes or whatever, but 7% is arguably pretty good deal for everything the App Store offers. David Barnard: And imagine how different the last decade of developer relations would have been had Apple capped it at that. And then, the incentive wasn't for the financial side of things. The incentive was to build a fantastic platform for developers and empower them to serve our customers and keep innovating. John Gruber: And encourage developers and designers and even the companies and managers at those... Who aren't nerds and are into the platform, but just to encourage as much as they can, the mindset of, "Maybe we should build this for Apple platforms exclusively, because of the great APIs and capabilities and... Why even bother with these other platforms? We don't make any money on them. We're doing so great iOS only." They've really gotten away from that. It's to Apple's benefit in obvious ways to have as many developers as possible making Apple platform exclusive software. And at this point, there's such a resentment that to so many people, whether they're managers or executives or developers or just users who are like, "Well, you'd be crazy to build for Apple only because they're sort of against you in terms of trying to just take your money." David Barnard: As a long-term Apple watcher and being friends with so many developers. What do you think it would take? Is a reset even in the cards for Apple at this point? Would it take Phil Schiller on stage at the iPhone 18 whatever- John Gruber: They don't do anything on stage- David Barnard: ... keynote. Well, you're right. But what would it take to get a reset? Above the... I mean- John Gruber: I don't know. David Barnard: ... the money would probably go a long way like, "Okay. We're just going to drop the rate." But it does almost feel like there needs to be some level of that 1997 Jobs' humility of like, "Hey, we made some mistakes. You're going to see a new Apple moving forward." John Gruber: Yeah. But I think you don't have to do it... I don't think it's within Apple to say, "We made some mistakes and we're going to change," even though that's sort of how he addressed. He was willing to say that at WWDC 1997 because what they were scrapping were things that weren't under him, right? OpenDoc and Newton and everything else they scrapped. They weren't Jobs-led post next reunification projects. The Apple way of doing it would be to act like, "We've come up with this amazing new idea that only Apple could do and it's totally innovative and nobody else has ever suggested it before. And it's called taking less money from the App Store," right? And not apologizing and not saying... Presenting it as a new opportunity in the same way that they're pitching the liquid glass of iOS 26 as, "Hey, the capabilities of the hardware and the GPU and the screen display technology with HDR is such that we're able to present this interface that we couldn't have done before." Just present it as the market opportunities and the success of the iPhone are such that we're able to have a new financial set of rules around the App Store that we couldn't have done before, even though they could have. But just say that they couldn't. David Barnard: It's just frustrating on a human level. It's like at work, when I do something stupid or whatever, you apologize. There's just humanity in that level of humility that it is just frustrating to me on a human level. John Gruber: But that would count as an apology, right? It would. Because we'd know. David Barnard: For us as Apple followers, it would. But I think in 2025, the press would have a field day with that and just call BS in a way that I don't know that it would work. And this is kind of something I've been thinking more and more is that Apple needs to do some things on Apple, like to adjust to the realities of 2025 and to set themselves up for the next decade as a platform for developers as a consumer brand and everything else. For example, the small business program was so freaking Apple-like. Instead of just saying, "Hey, 15% for the first million, 30% for everything after," there was all these rules. You got to get into the program and then you get kicked out of the program and they created all these weird... To me, that's just the perfect example of how Apple over does things. And so, to usher in an App Store 3.0, I think we need to see them do things un-Apple-like. And I think that... Again, it's the fanboy in me just wanting to see a new version of Apple. Not that I hate Apple, not that I think they're idiots inside Apple, not that I think anything poor of them as a company, I want to see them succeed. I want to wear Apple glasses, not Meta glasses with a camera on them. And I think there's aspects of what they're building and the trust they've built with consumers and everything else that is setting them up for potentially being that next human computing platform. But having developers on your side and enthusiastic about it is going to be a huge, huge, huge boon. And given how competitive Meta and Google and OpenAI and others are and will be in the coming years, maybe it does require a bit deeper of a reset and doing some things that aren't traditionally how Apple operates. I think even this WWDC was a little bit of a reckoning in that Ben Thompson got it, you got it. Some people got it like, "Hey, this is Apple not overpromising so that they can overdeliver." But the press had a field day with like, "Oh, it's a boring..." They're so far behind on AI and all that kind of stuff. John Gruber: Nobody remembers that though. I mean, it's news for a week and here we are a month out and I think it's already forgotten. And I think Apple should have the fortitude, and the wisdom and you've mentioned at the outset, that their leadership's been there for so long. They remember this, they know how it goes, and they should just be confident in themselves in that way. The other thing about the fact that so many of the senior leaders have been there for so long, it means that most of them are nearing retirement. Schiller has stepped down and is in a different position as an Apple fellow. He still runs events, he still runs the App Store. Tim Cook is... I forget how many. What year? 64 or something like that? Or 63. Eddy Cue and Joz are in their 60s. And I'm not saying any of them are leaving soon. I mean, I'm sure none of them are going to pre-announce their retirements. But in terms of setting things up for the next generation of senior leadership at Apple, which is coming sooner rather than later, right? It's coming over the next decade, across the board, I think that they need to reset the institutional priorities of the company, because the new generation won't have that experience from the '90s that you brought up on this show to explain this. And instead if they took over right now, will just have the mindset of, "Oh, the way Apple works is they expect 30% of all the money on the platform." That's just the way it is and that they don't have any history behind it or why, but that they think that. As opposed to thinking that the most important thing Apple should do is encourage stoke and keep going in an ongoing relationship developer enthusiasm for building exclusive software for our platforms. And making it as great as possible and thinking, "Some of the best software experiences on our platforms are going to come from our third party developers, not from Apple." And that that's the way it should be. And we shouldn't be thinking that all of the best software comes from Apple and it's an afterthought what third parties make. David Barnard: And to your point, I hadn't thought of this until you've brought it up, that in setting things up for the future, I think there is onus on the current executives to not hold on to the past for the next decade when it's then too late. They're in the position, today, and having been at Apple 40 years... But one of the impressive things about Meta these past decade is that as a founder-led company, Zuckerberg put $100 billion into Reality Labs and is force of will and telling shareholders, "Hey, we're making these massive investments and they're going to pay off." And now, he's doing the same with AI, $100 million checks to lure AI talent. That's not something the stock market normally would reward, but he is out there pitching the world that, "Hey, this is an investment worth making and we're going to make it." And I think these Apple executives who've been there 40 years are the best people to say and convince the world, "Hey, we need to make some investments on the developer front and that's going to involve less services revenue," or whatever it has to be. But it's going to pay off in spades in the long run with the innovation that's going to happen with the renewed developer sentiment and everything else. That they're going to need for this next big platform in the coming 5 to 10 years. And it may be too late if they hold on. John Gruber: Well, I agree. David Barnard: Well, I think that's a fantastic place to wrap it up. And really, what I wanted to say on this podcast and hopefully people have gotten that depth of history of when you're frustrated with Apple about this policy or that, there's a lot more going on behind the scenes than... And I mean even, again, as much as I complain on Twitter, I'll acknowledge that I lack a ton of context and I lack a lot of insight. And I'm sure I can understand why people inside Apple are frustrated at the way I frame things sometimes. But when you take all of that history and everything else into account, something needs to change. I'm not sure exactly what that is and me lobbying is me just throwing out ideas. Happy to be wrong about any of this, anything I'm suggesting. But I hope it's helpful to folks to better understand Apple in these ways. John Gruber: If there's one other point that I'll close with, it would be that I mentioned earlier that the problem Apple found itself in the early '90s when Jobs was exiled was this they were caught in this '80s mindset of every couple years, a new platform replaces the old platform and the old platform goes away. When, in fact, the Macintosh was here to stay and they just weren't treating it that way. I'd say Apple's come full circle now and views its platforms as institutions that are there to last decades, including, well, all of the platforms that they have. Including the Mac, which started in 1984. But the iPhone certainly, iPad, even the lesser ones like Watch and tvOS And I think visionOS are things that they intend to last for decades which, at this point, will last well past the careers of the senior leadership at the company. And I think they have that mindset. But I think they're currently doing some things and, again, related to money, just the goddamn money, that are contrary to fostering that. But it's this long-term mindset that the company has that these platforms are institutions and that Apple at a whole is an institution that is meant to be here for a very long time. David Barnard: And if they don't change... Or maybe they don't have to change, I don't even know. John Gruber: But I think if they don't change, then when new things come, they become legacy only. They're not going to disappear. The iPhone is not going anywhere. But the risk to the company is that they become legacy only maybe like Microsoft would be if they hadn't moved to the cloud, right? If Microsoft was still just about Windows and Office and stuff like that, where they would be? They would miss out on the next thing. That their next thing isn't going to hit unless they have developer buy-in. And that you can easily disguise that with the ongoing revenue and profits from those legacy things. In the same way that Microsoft would still be a very big healthy company, even if they hadn't shifted under Satya Nadella, but they wouldn't be number two or number one in the world right now. David Barnard: Yeah. All right. Well, it's been two and a half hours. I think we do need to wrap up but fascinating conversation. Thank you so much for your time, John, and this was- John Gruber: Thanks for having me. David Barnard: Glad to have you. John Gruber: This was fun.

On the podcast I talk with John about the fascinating 40-year history of Apple’s developer relations, how almost going bankrupt in the 1990s shaped today’s control-focused approach, and why we might need an ‘App Store 3.0’ reset. Top Takeaways: 🕹️ The 1980s: Apple’s developer DNA was born Apple’s earliest wins came from nurturing third-party developers, even spinning off its own apps to avoid competing with outsiders. 💸 Microsoft saved Apple (literally) Apple’s near-bankruptcy in the ’90s made them both humble and wary—forever shaping how they deal with developers and competition. 🍎 From “please build for us” to “we choose you” WWDC 2008 saw Apple begging for apps and evangelist emails on slides; today, it’s the other way around. 🖥️ The “Delicious Era” fueled iPhone success Mac indie devs (Panic, Delicious Monster, Bare Bones) built a design-obsessed, passionate community—setting the stage for the iPhone App Store boom. 🚪 App Store 1.0: A new world for indies For the first time, solo developers could launch businesses from home. No server costs, no payments hassle—just build, submit, and sell. 🏦 Apple’s rules got stricter as the App Store grew As the App Store became a services giant, the partnership vibe faded. Developers went from partners to “users” of Apple’s marketplace. 📉 App Store math now feels upside down Today, indie devs can pay Apple millions, while giants like Meta pay almost nothing. The fee logic and incentives don’t fit 2025. ⏳ The platform needs an “App Store 3.0” reset John and David call for a new era: lower fees, clearer rules, and Apple acting as a true platform partner—not just a toll booth. 🔄 Developer enthusiasm is Apple’s long-term moat Apple risks becoming a “legacy only” giant if it loses developer goodwill. The most important apps are still built by outsiders. 👥 A generational handoff is coming With Apple’s senior leadership nearing retirement, now is the time to set new priorities: empower developers, invest in the ecosystem, and ensure Apple’s platforms stay vibrant for decades to come.

My guest today is John Gruber, Raconteur, Apple aficionado, podcast host and sole proprietor of Daring Fireball. On the podcast, I talk with John about the fascinating 40-year history of Apple's developer relations, how almost going bankrupt in the '90s shaped today's control-focused approach and why we might need an App Store 3.0 reset. Hey, John, thanks so much for coming back on the podcast. John Gruber: Well, you've been on my show. I hope to have you on my show again soon, so it's the least I can do. I'm happy to be here. David Barnard: So today, I want to talk Apple Kremlinology, which I think is maybe a great term. I just threw it out there. Apple is such a unique organization that... And for most developers, it's like our most important partner. And I'm doing air quotes for those listening on the podcast. And I don't think a lot of people understand Apple, and I think a lot of how people interact with Apple, what they think of Apple is shaped by just not understanding them, which is maybe on Apple. But that's what I wanted to talk about today was better understanding Apple. And I think of all the people to have this conversation with, it's going to be really fun to have it with you. John Gruber: I appreciate that and only because, and I hate to flatter myself. I really do. I really do. I try to stay as humble as possible. I feel like that's what keeps me in the game. But understanding Apple to me is maybe one of the top three things I have. I really.... David Barnard: Yeah. Yeah, totally. John Gruber: And there's always been an intuitive, oh, I love this company vibe fit and some other rolls of the dice of the way my life could have worked out surely on many of the other rolls of the dice. I end up working at Apple for some amount of time, possibly a very short amount of time, because every time I've ever had a job in my life where I actually am not self-employed has not lasted all that long. So probably not long, but one of my earliest memories, I think it was either fifth or sixth grade, which was early '80s, probably like 1983, '84, I just remember reading a story about Apple Computer and I knew at the time that I liked Apple Computers better than other company's computers, and I loved computers. But I remember reading a story about the company and reading that all of the employees just show up to work in sneakers and jeans and T-shirts and that they wear clever T-shirts and they make. Every time they start a new project, the first job is to print up T-shirts for the team for the new project, and then they wear them to work. And I remember thinking, that's awesome because I don't want to wear a freaking suit and tie to work. And I remember telling my dad this and my dad telling me, "John, there is no way that a major computer company lets the people show up to work in jeans and T-shirts." And I was like, "No, I'm telling you, dad, I read it in a magazine. It's true." David Barnard: That's awesome. And then not to flutter myself, but while we're... We should have scripted this, and I should have done this for you and you should have done this for me, but I relied on ChatGPT pretty heavily to do research for the show because I wanted to go really in-depth in the history of Apple and their relationships with developers. And last night, I'm getting through my notes and ChatGPT says, "Three of the prominent voices in App Store related topics are John Gruber, Ben Thompson and David Barnard." And I don't know if it knew it was me and was freaking trying to flatter me or whatever, but I mean, similar to you in a way that the App Store is something I'm unreasonably passionate about. I have an emotional attachment to the App Store and care so deeply about it. And in part, and you know I've discussed this, I was a recording engineer and I knew that was kind of a dead end as far as having a family and being able to provide and stuff like that. But I was a huge Apple nerd, so I got a 17-inch PowerBook in 2003. So my Apple journey begins a little later. I mean, I used them in college and I played with a original Mac in the '80s, but my real Apple fanboyism started in 2002, 2003. So I jumped right into the App Store in 2008 thinking, "Okay, this is an opportunity to build a real career that's going to provide for my family." And it did. I'm 17 years into owning an app business and I care so deeply about the store and then also care so deeply about Apple. And so everything we're going to talk about today, it's like you being one of the people who cares the most about Apple, who's outside Apple, and me, one of the people who cares the most about the App Store outside of Apple, I think is the two right people to have this kind of conversation. And maybe we should have had Ben on and to have a third voice, but... John Gruber: There are certain things that I just remember which years they were, and I just remember that 2007 iPhone no App Store, 2008 App Store comes out. 2009, it really takes off and coincides really with the go-go years of Twitter. And that's absolutely 100%, there's no confusion. I mean, maybe you sent me an email at daringfireball.net or something, but where I remember getting to know you was on Twitter, and I just remember like it's one of the great privileges of my position doing what I do with Daring Fireball where it's like, "Oh, I'm going to get to know this guy," and we'd at each other on Twitter about App Store issues, but I was like, "This guy," I could sense both your profound enthusiasm for it and the way that it was making you... It wasn't making a fanboy of the App Store where no matter what you wanted to say, "Oh, I love the App Store. So no matter what, I'm going to make my conclusion, whatever changes they make are great." Your enthusiasm was such that you're like, "I want to understand every single thing about this to the deepest degree." And again, it's sort of like a laziness where I'm like, "Oh, if I become friends with this guy," and I've got a Rolodex of people who are experts on whatever, it could be AppKit, could be UIKit, could be the App Store, could be... And you're at the top of the list for the App store and have been since 2009 and probably should have been since 2008. But I just remember, 2009, you were just a key follow on Twitter for App Store related stuff, and it was such a fascinating time, explosive, just an explosive time. David Barnard: Well, and I was a Gruber fanboy, and you linking to my app in the fall of 2008, I think wasn't part of turning point. I mean, they were key people who helped me along the way, including people inside Apple. And I remember vividly... John Gruber: It was the Launcher app, right? What was it called? David Barnard: No, no, no, this was 2008. You linked to my mileage logging app. When the App Store launched, there was this terrible Windows phone ish, horrible user interface, no kind of Mac or iOS interface paradigm, a mileage log. They got there first, which is still eats me to this day. 17 years later, I missed the launch of the App Store because Apple did not approve my developer account. And so a month later, I release a mileage log, it was like we follow the iOS paradigms, I mean, looking back, I don't ever feel like I had the best taste, but I didn't have... It was brown and it was not the prettiest or most, but it was iOS. We used the paradigms of iOS. We built a native app. And so you link to that in the fall of 2008, and it was a turning point. John Gruber: Well, I'm happy, I remember that. And that was the other thing that I remember about you is it wasn't just that you were obsessive about the App Store, is that you actually had skin in the game, and that you clearly... Again, I'm not just trying to butter you up here, but no, but there was at that time, at the very highest level when they first announced the iPhone and said, "Hey," and underneath it was one of the... It wasn't called a Bento box at the time. They did the slides in a different style. But at Steve Jobs original introduction, they had a bunch of things on a slide and they said Cocoa, that everything Apple had done for the original iPhone, before the iPhone, before the App Store, and before they announced, famously took them several months before they said, "Okay, we're going to do an SDK," but they said that they were using Cocoa. There's like a five-minute podcast Merlin Mann did at Macworld Expo talking to me and Jason Snell, the day of the keynote on the floor, it was like a five-minute interview with me and Snell by Merlin Mann. And Snell and I were like, "Apple didn't say much about this Cocoa thing, but presumably at some point, it's just probably not ready yet. They're going to open up APIs and this is going to be huge." I mean, this was hours after the keynote when we were still euphoric about the whole thing because everybody was sort of looking forward to just an iPod phone, right? David Barnard: Right. John Gruber: And it was so much more, it felt like my mind had gotten significantly bigger during the keynote. My brain had grown because the realm of possibility of personal computing was suddenly much larger than I thought. But in that initial moment, most developers were thinking was, "Well, that's fantastic if they're Xocoa APIs," and UIKits slightly different than AppKit, but every single AppKit going back to next developer I know looked at the initial UIKit APIs and was like, "Oh, all right, this is different, but I know this, this is very familiar." But the idea that developers had was how do you take ideas that are good Mac apps and put them on the phone? And for many apps, that was a great idea and Apple itself did that, right? Safari, mail, how do you take mail and make a version that fits on the phone? But the opportunity that I think Mac developers didn't think of right away is what sort of ideas only make sense for a phone, a little pocket, 3.5 inch screen device that's with you all the time. That wouldn't make sense on a Mac and a mileage tracker is exactly that sort of idea. That's what I remember hitting me about that app in 2008. Like, oh, this would be stupid on the Mac. What are you going to do? Take your MacBook or PowerBook? I forget what, I guess they were MacBook set by 2008, but what are you going to do? Take a laptop with you in your car everywhere and log your gas and mileage? No, but for something that would replace what you would've done in a pocket notebook, that's a perfect idea. Obviously, people want this. And that's where I feel like you were ahead of me and I'm like, "I got to follow this guy because he's thinking about things that are phone first." David Barnard: Right. Yeah. Well, enough navel-gazing. I'm blushing. But I appreciate all of that. And again, just the perfect person to have this kind of conversation with, which I've wanted to have this conversation for a while in service of the community of... In my day job at RevenueCat, and I do still build apps on the side, so I'm still an indie developer, I was looking at my LinkedIn the other day and 17 years at Contrast and still going strong, still running my weather app on the side and stuff. So at my day job at RevenueCat, I interface with a ton of developers and a lot of them don't care one lick about Apple, in fact, I mean, the growing hostility, people who've never built an app before will book an office hours call with me and say, "Screw Apple, screw them in their 30%." There's no care for Apple as a company or the products or anything like that. And so I wanted to do this podcast to give some of that history. I was actually thinking as I was preparing these notes, it's almost a book at some point, the history of the App Store and how it shaped the world. I mean, so many decisions that Apple made, big and small, literally did shape how things happen, and we'll get into some of that. But I wanted to step all the way back, and again, in doing the research for this over the weekend, I saw something that really surprised me, and I think I knew this, but I hadn't seen the numbers. And that is that the three top executives at Apple whose teams work on the app store. So I think maybe, and Apple is famously secretive about who does what and who reports to who and those kinds of things. But from my understanding... John Gruber: They're secretive about everything, David. David Barnard: Everything, yeah. Yeah. Something like 90% of the people who interface with developers in the App Store who work on the App Store report up to three executives. Greg Joswiak, who joined Apple in 1986. John Gruber: Yeah, I think right out of college. He went to University of Michigan and went right to Apple. David Barnard: Phil Schiller, who joined Apple in 1987, and Eddy Cue who joined Apple in 1989. And so to really understand Apple and how they interact with developers and how they receive the developer community, you really do have to go all the way back to the 1980s when these three key executives joined and started, and each of them have their different role in developer relations over time. But going back to that 1984 release of the Mac and these early days of developer relations between Apple and developers, I think is so fascinating, and one of the things, again, I didn't eve... I knew, but seeing it again in black and white, just how instrumental Microsoft was in those early days to Apple that two years ahead of the 1984 release of the Mac, Microsoft had agreed to build products for this new platform. And then specifically, and again, never heard this before, but Bill Gates was kind of an Apple fanboy in some of the early days before they got really contentious. And I read this history piece about the history of Apple that said Gates would show up to events, Macworld and other events with Macintosh shirts, he would wear a Macintosh. I mean, can you even imagine Bill Gates in the '80s wearing Macintosh T-shirt? It was just such a different era. But then over time, developer relations started to get a bit contentious. What do you remember? I mean, you were, gosh, like 6, 8, 10 at the time when all this happened. And I was five. But we both read a lot about the history. So what do you recall? And then what do you remember from having read upon all this. John Gruber: Too young to have experienced those years extemporaneously, but from what I've read, one of the key superpowers that Gates had, and I think it's true, I think this is not an original observation, but no matter how big, and no matter even... I mean, I guess eventually after, when you get closer to 50 years, which Apple and Microsoft are at, but maybe closer to a century after entire original generations have clearly all died off, it fades away. But all companies in all fields are just infused with the personalities of their founders. And one of the things that Gates infused in Microsoft was an amazing willingness or just natural ability. I don't even think it was something he did purposefully. I think it's just the way his mind worked is he was always thinking what could be and was not attached to the way things were. The whole name Microsoft, the whole idea that revolution of the company was, "Hey, we could make a company." This was him and Paul Allen that just focuses on software and had no plans in those early days to make their own computer. And all of the action in the late '70s at that moment of the PC revolution, the late '70s and the early '80s was on the company's making computers, Apple and Commodore and Texas Instruments, you name it, IBM, once they made the PC and Microsoft's key insight was, "Hey, software is incredibly valuable." And at the time, that idea alone was revolutionary. It was absolutely revolutionary because everybody else thought the only thing that matters is computers and computers were all absurdly expensive. Just look at the memory that was in those computers. The Commodore 64 was called the 64, not because it was 64 bit, but because it had 64 kilobytes of RAM, right? That was the 64, and it wasn't cheap, cheap. And the idea was software, you just copy, it was just ones and zeros. You could just make copies. And the idea that no, no software is worth paying for was a revolution. And I think that's why Gates could have such incredible enthusiasm for something like some other company's computer because everything they did was for somebody else's computer. They didn't make computers and they didn't really have a platform. And so I think Gates recognized early that Apple made better computers and that they were onto something. And he clearly, from the outset, had the mindset of the complete opposite of, I forget his name, but the 1960s era, IBM CEO who said, "I think there's a market in the world for six or seven computers." Because the thinking in that era was, well, the US military will want one, maybe like the US IRS, and there'll be one great supercomputer for universities to share. Whereas Gates was really thinking early on, "Oh no, there should be computers in every house." But he wasn't thinking that Microsoft would own a platform. But then when the opportunity came with DOS and they saw the opportunity they had by owning MS-DOS and being the company that provided it, it changed their thinking completely to instead of, oh, we'll make software for anybody's computer. We're going to make a platform and we'll still make some software for other platforms, but we really want to steer everybody to our platform even though we don't make the computers. David Barnard: One of the interesting footnotes in this as well is that Apple had a similar idea of we're building this platform, we need to make sure there's software on it. And so they built Mac, right? MacPaint, MacDraw, and a bunch of other apps. And again, something I didn't realize until doing all this research was that in 1986, they stopped bundling those because it was competitive with third-party developers. And man, I mean, these days with sherlocking and Apple building an app for everything, I mean, even most recently building an invite app like building a sports app, Apple has over the last 17 years of the App Store gone deeper and deeper and further and further into competing directly with third-party developers. But back here in the '80s, they were like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We don't want to squash the potential for third-party developers to build for this platform that we have. So these apps that we built for our own platform that we have previously bundled," I mean, again, at some point maybe when Schiller or Jos or one of these guys retires, we'll do this again and get the inside scoop on some of the deeper thinking behind this. But they stopped bundling, and then in 1987, they spun all those apps off into Claris, a subsidiary of Apple to have them at little bit more of an arm's length. It's specifically to not interfere with third-party developers. And it's still fascinating to go all the way back to the '80s and see such a different Apple that they recognized the power of developers in the platform and were actively doing things at that time to make sure they didn't compete. They didn't make it a non-starter for people to build these kind of apps for the Macintosh platform, which is just fascinating. John Gruber: And it was about a decade, I would say maybe '86, '87, and those are the years where I was there as a teenager into college, and '86 to '95, '96 or so was the decade where Apple was very hands-off about first-party apps and it made sense. And one of the areas of contention, it's sort of like a heartbreak, and I forget the exact details. I know Andy Hertzfeld's wonderful, wonderful... I think there's a story about it on Folklore.org, but you can look it up. But there were two basics, the basic programming language for the Mac in the very early '80s and Apple Basic was much better and could let you do Macintosh-like things like pop open a dialog box, which you think like, well, of course, why would you want to have a programming environment for the Mac that couldn't pop open a dialog box? But that was revolutionary at the time, and Microsoft had their basic, and as like a, let's keep Microsoft happy, Apple sort of squashed their own in-house basic, which was a much better programming environment for the Macintosh. So as not to step on the toes of Microsoft Basic, which was more of a oh, character based sort of text interface basic, where you could write the same Microsoft Basic program and run it on the Mac and run it on any other computer that had Microsoft Basic. And that's just one example of that sort of thinking and this sort of thing that led them to spin off the initial, which they had to do again because nobody knew how to write these graphical user interface programs. It often comes up and people, you have to Google the images to believe it, but the original Macintosh keyboard didn't have arrow keys because they wanted to force developers and users to use the mouse as opposed to almost all other computers at the time didn't even have mice. So there was the Macintosh, which had a mouse and other computers which had no pointer interface, just a keyboard interface. So you'd be like, "What do you want to do in the computer?" And it would present a text menu and you'd use arrow keys to go up and down. I want to open existing file down. I want to create a new file down. I want to manage my files up, down, left, right. So to force developers to make programs that were mouse driven, mouse pointer driven. Apple didn't even put arrow keys on the original Macintosh keyboard, which imagine the frustration editing text now. So if you wanted to, you could backspace, there was a delete key, but if you wanted to go back a word or two, you had to go take your hands off the keyboard, go to the mouse and click where you wanted to go. But I understand why that didn't last, but I also understand the thinking at the time to break people's habits because as much as they thought this is a computer for the rest of us, which was their slogan, and this will be the way that most people in the future learn to use computers. Right now, the market is people who already know how to use computers, but what they know from the existing computers isn't the way this computer works. And so they had to make apps like MacWrite and MacPaint and MacDraw, and then two years in, they're like, "Ah, we're kind of squashing the market. What we really need is a thriving third party market, so let's go hands off." And then for the next decade, the Mac really didn't have many first party programs. If you just went to the store and bought a brand new Macintosh in 1991 or '92, you got TextEdit or it was called SimpleText at the time. There were very few apps that were built in. There was no built-in Contacts app. You didn't have all these things that you would think, "Oh, how do you have a computer without an address book?" Well, the idea was that whole thing was a third party opportunity. David Barnard: And this is a great example of why I wanted to have this conversation, and maybe we'll pull on some of these threads as we go through. One thing to understand about Apple and how they operate today is that they've had success in doing those sorts of things. And so when you look at Apple TV that famously launched, and Apple tried to get people to develop games for it, but you could only use the Apple remote, and it was Apple as with the keyboard not having arrow keys, it was, we don't want people to require a gaming controller to build games, so we're going to force them to use remote. And games sucked, and I was so pissed at Apple, it took them, what, three or four years to finally enable controller support. And by that time, it was just so clear that Apple TV was not going to be a gaming platform, maybe could have been more of a gaming platform had they done it, maybe it was the right choice, whatever. And then look at the Vision Pro. Two years ago, I was so frustrated that Apple didn't release motion track controllers like what you have on the Meta Quest, but why did they do that? It goes all the way back to 1984 and not having the arrow keys, it was, "Hey, we're introducing a new user interface paradigm, a new user experience, and we want to force developers to build apps that use hand gestures and eye tracking and not controllers." Now, two years later, they just announced at WABC that PlayStation VR controller support in Vision Pro, but this is two years after the fact, and I was so frustrated two years ago. But this is one of those things when you look back, you better understand why they make the decisions they make. They have a long history of making those kinds of decisions going all the way back to the '80s and forcing developers into the path that they think is best for the platform is just so fascinating. John Gruber: I keep repeating it. I'm more bullish on visionOS as a platform than most commentators, and I keep drawing the analogy to the original Macintosh, the original Macintosh in 1984, I know the number off the top of my head because I bring it up all the time. It was $2,500, which inflation adjusted is give or take right now, like $7,200. There was only one config. There was no option to get more RAM. There was no storage, you used floppy drives. So $2,500, it was 7,200 equivalent today about twice the cost of a Vision Pro, very expensive. It's sold so poorly and so under their expectations that it was the impetus for driving jobs out of the company. And in the whole, people don't know the history, like how in the world did Apple kick Steve Jobs out of the company? The real reasons were mostly personality conflicts, and that yes, of course, he did not work well when there was somebody else, John Sculley from Pepsi as the CEO who Jobs, the founder, ostensibly reported to, of course, Jobs did not work well as anything but the CEO, and that's ultimately the reason. But in terms of going to the board and having reasons other than this guy's a pain in my ass, to force him out, the sales of the Mac were the... And again, it was expensive and Apple couldn't really afford the fact that it was a bit of a flop in 1984, 1985, but the PC press of the time took it as, "Hey, this whole graphical user interface thing, it's clever, but it's a gimmick. This isn't how real computer users want to use a computer. Nobody wants to take their hands off the keyboard and use a mouse all the time. It's a waste of memory to be drawing all these windows and stuff like this." That was all proven wrong. The Mac was the right idea for the future of personal computing, but it needed at least four or five years before you're like, "Holy, shit, this is like a thriving platform that's revolutionizing certain industries like desktop publishing." David Barnard: Yeah. And as a 40, almost 50-year-old company, I guess next year it's 50 years, somewhere around there. Apple's patience is remarkable. This is another thing that I continually get wrong, and I think a lot of people get wrong. 100% agree on the Vision Pro. It is a phenomenal piece of hardware. It is an incredible platform for experimenting with the future, even if it's flawed and even if there are problems. But Apple's patient, and clearly they have AR stuff in the labs that Cook and others have played with. There's been reporting recently about all Tim Cook thinks about is getting to this AR glasses future or whatever it might be. And the Vision Pro is that first step along the way, and Apple is very patient, as much as people pan it as few units as they sold, even if it's been less successful as they internally hope for, they are nothing if not a patient company that's going to keep plugging away at these things. Because look how it turned out for the Mac, like you said, it took four or five years. Well, I mean, we're two years into the Vision Pro. They've got time and they've got cash to wait around and they've got the experience of building these platforms over decades, not making sure something is a hit in months and days. John Gruber: This is only based on observation, but I think I almost see how can somebody refute this is that their thinking is basically if their projection of where a hit AR/VR, let's just put aside whether the first hit product in the category will be AR or VR, but it'll probably be AR, right? VR is just too weird where my definition of the difference, the broad difference here is if the device is off, powered off, can you see anything or do you see through glasses, right? If it's glasses that when the device is at 0% battery powered off, you still see through the lenses, that's AR. And if it's like Vision Pro where it's off, it's like blindfolds, that's VR, it's probably AR, but let's just say it doesn't matter. Put that aside, that it'll take till around 2030 to have a product at a price and a feature set and a battery life that's compelling to explode in popularity and that people will be like, "I got to get one of those." If it's 2030, when that's going to come out, what's the right way to approach the market? And I think the people who are laughing at Vision Pro and saying, "It's $3,500, nobody's bought one. They've only sold hundreds of thousands, not even a million, whatever." Apple should have waited until then to release a product, and then boom, here's the first thing. And the iPhone was sort of like that, right? And the iPhone was right out of the gate. Yes, it was a little more expensive, but the first iPhone was incredibly useful, totally credible device. And I know it didn't sell in great quantities compared to today's numbers, but as somebody who bought one, it was like, "Yeah, this is real." And it's not like I'm buying a product that hints at a future. The Vision Pro is not like that. The Vision Pro is not the iPhone in 2007. The Vision Pro today, I don't like calling it a dev kit, but it's like an enthusiast kit, which includes developers, but it's an enthusiast kit that you spend a ridiculous amount of money compared to a MacBook Air. You get a really good MacBook Air for $1,000, or you could get a really good MacBook Air for 1,300, $1,400. This is three times, four times more expensive and it's less essential to people's lives than their iPhone, which you can get a really good iPhone for seven, $800. It's different than that, but is the right strategy to wait until that hardware is out in 2030 and then start there with building a platform or is the right strategy to start building a platform around 2023, 2024, and when that hardware is finally available and there's a breakthrough in the technology and the price and the capabilities in the battery life that you've got five years of ecosystem and content behind it. All these complaints, again, I've complained too and I'm a little surprised, but they're getting there, just in terms of having entertaining immersive content, the things like the Bono video and the adventure climbing mountains and all this stuff. They've got some stuff, you would think with their budget that they could have more, but the idea of, hey, if they're going to sell this thing for all this money, shouldn't they have more content available? Well, if 2030 is when they think this is going to explode, think of how much content they're going to have in the library by then. And I think that's what they know. There are so many similarities between this and the Macintosh in 1984, but there are also so many profound differences because Apple is so big and so pervasive in popular culture and people's lives. And it breeds a different sentiment towards the company, which I think we're going to continue talking about with developer relations. But then on the other hand, their profound, almost unfathomable financial success gives them the liberty of saying, "We're going to make a seven-year bet that costs a lot of money," just in terms of this thousand or so software engineers who work on Vision stuff inside the company. We're going to make a profound bet to build this out over half a decade so that when the hardware's really there for a mass-market thing, we've got it. We've already got the platform, we've already got the UI paradigms nailed down, we've got the input, we've got the sensors. We're going to be... John Gruber: ... nailed down. We've got the input, we've got the sensors. We're going to be there five years ahead of time. It's a very different way of thinking than a company that is sweating it out. Are we still going to be in business two quarters from now? David Barnard: Yeah, and I think that's part of the pushback is that too many people, especially in the press, continue to expect every product Apple releases to be the next iPhone. And the iPhone is just singular in history as a consumer electronic device that it was able to come out of the gate as such an incredible useful day one thing. Because even, and again, I mean, this is why we're having this conversation. You go back to 1984, the $2,500, which is $7,200 a day or whatever it is, was not a daily driver, this is changing my life, most productive thing in the world. It was a nice to have, it was an enthusiast, it was something to tinker with and maybe you find a few productivity things here and there that it benefits. Apple has done this decade after decade after decade, and they have that long vision. And again, going back to these execs who've been around through it all, it's like they've seen it happen and they know it will happen and they know it can happen. And to your point, they're not under that pressure of the Vision Pro has to be the iPhone. It doesn't have to be the iPhone. We've done this 10 times before with different products with transitioning from Power PC to Intel, with early days of iMac and it becoming a consumer hit that wasn't even the massive smash hit compared to the iPhone. And so it's like they know how to build platforms over decades and not over months and years that everybody else expects it to happen. John Gruber: So the one difference, and it is almost the same thing but along a different vector where I said about Gates and the way that Gates instilled in Microsoft a sort of flexibility in thinking like, hey, what's the opportunities right now? I think Satya Nadella's era as CEO embodies that where I feel like he came in and was like, you know what? We don't have to be all about Windows, Windows, Windows. We can go to more of a cloud first mindset and look at where they are financially and in cloud services and stuff. It's been a great deal for them, but that they got their institutional fortitude is once we have a hit, we will latch onto it and try to stick with it and ride it all the way down. And that was the whole mindset with Windows. Windows everywhere and they're going to put Windows on your TV set-top box and Windows phone, right? And they were trying to make smartphones years before the iPhone and literally they had a start menu in the lower left corner. It looked like Windows 95 but on a phone and it wasn't running Windows apps, but it was a mindset of bringing Windows mentality. Whereas Apple's mindset led by Steve Jobs was let's start from scratch. And as much as they wound up using the Cocoa APIs and made UI kit, it was only not because that was a starting point. It was like, okay, if we're going to do this, maybe we could fit a small version of the Mac kernel onto this device and we'll build it, but we're not going to have any compatibility. It's not going to be called the Mac phone. We're not going to have an Apple menu up in the upper left corner. We're going to rethink this whole thing from scratch. Apple has this sort of, if it's a new form factor, we're going to start with a new platform and that's a very different thinking, but at another level, just in terms of its capabilities, the reason the iPhone could debut in 2007 as a totally credible, you could buy one right now, the first one totally useful is that it's ultimately, and this is the unifying theme of the last five years of dithering with me and Ben Thompson, is that the biggest marketing shame of the entire industry is that we wasted the term personal computer on desktop and laptop computers in 1980 because the phone is ultimately the personal computer. And that's where everything was heading from the Apple One in 1977 until 2007. Everything was heading towards building something under $1,000 that fit in your pocket and had an interface that anybody could just use and that the input was just poking at it with your finger and it was all visual and it had wireless connection to a network that connected to the entire world. It was so science fiction from the perspective of 1978, 79, but within 30 years, that's where everything in those 30 years was heading. So when it launched, it was really the culmination of what we've called personal computers for 30 years, whereas Vision Pro is sort of like, let's do something all new and we have to sort of start from scratch. It's going to be way too expensive and heavy and limited and the battery's going to be a pain in the ass, but it's a totally new vector. David Barnard: Yeah, well, we've kind of gotten ahead of ourselves. I want to go all the way back to the eighties again. It's important to step through the history of these developer relations of what brought us even to the iPhone. So I'll speed through this. You and I could talk for five hours, but I don't think we should turn this into a five-hour podcast, so I'll speed through a little bit of this. But going all the way back to the eighties, PageMaker was a huge turning point. Third party app, some people have credited it as saving the Mac platform. That it was so important to digital publishing and this is where as a platform apps can revolutionize your platform. When you've built a and hardware and third party developers go nuts on it, they build new things and do things that you would've never done as a first party software closed ecosystem, it's only Apple and the Mac and we're the only ones building for it. You get this entire ecosystem of people building new things and PageMaker was one of those things that became so integral to the digital publishing world that it's credited as a third party app for saving the whole Apple Mac platform and then you get Illustrator for Mac in 87, you get Photoshop in 1990 and during this time I think Apple really recognizes that power of developers. Guy Kawasaki joined around that time. I forget exactly, I think he may have joined before the 1984 Mac, but he was the first software evangelist and developer evangelist. Again, in doing research for this and reading up on some of the history of this, I realized just how much a debt of gratitude in some ways I owe to Guy Kawasaki for me having a job today at Revenue is that he... This whole developer advocacy and people who aren't technical or... I mean, I'm mildly technical but really can promote these platforms. It goes all the way back to the eighties and Guy Kawasaki and Apple being so enthusiastic for third party developers. John Gruber: I know Guy a little, I feel like I should know him better. I feel like he sort of left this racket right around the time that I was becoming more prominent in this industry, but I've met him a few times, but I've read his books and the Macintosh Way, it's a great book if you can find a copy of it. When I joined Barebone Software, I worked at Bare Bones, the BB edit company from 2000 to 2002. It was the only mandatory reading before. It was like the entire employee onboarding process was you have to read Guy Kawasaki's the Macintosh Way, but arguably it was the Apple way and at the time though, because it was the only successful platform Apple had, the Macintosh and Apple were easily conflated, but I think that what Guy Kawasaki really crystallized was the intersection of developers, users, and the platform maker and that combined the three could form a cohesive whole that everything... And formed a flywheel where it just kept benefiting everybody where users are happy and they're buying the devices, which helps the platform maker and that the more devices the platform maker makes, the bigger the market is for third party developers. And so third party developers make more and invest more in the platform and make more innovative software that makes users like, oh my God, look what PageMaker can do. Holy crap. And then the users buy more of the... And it just keeps going and going. David Barnard: Sounds a lot like the iPhone. John Gruber: Yeah, I think that the other thing that Guy Kawasaki really crystallized was the idea that you could be an important serious player professionally in this field without being a programmer or a designer even. You could be a professional user. I'm a writer and I have a computer science degree from college from long ago, so more technical than most users, but I get that mindset where kind of what I wanted to be was a professional user, by being an enthusiast and learning how everything works. And that was his evangelism. It wasn't evangelism in the sense of evangelizing a religion based on faith. It was more like a religion based on practical advantages, like hey, learn how to do these things, learn how the actual system works and you're going to have superpowers compared to people who do the same thing as you who don't understand how these computers work. One person can do the work of 10 people with a Macintosh, and it was true. David Barnard: I saw that guy has been doing the rounds on podcasts. You should definitely have them on your podcast at some point. That'd be one I would love to listen to, you and Guy talking through this for two hours. We're kind of breezing over it in five minutes here, but I think it would be a fascinating listen for you and Guy to kind of talk through that in more detail. But we did want to keep moving. So that was the kind of eighties and into the early nineties. But then what happened in the nineties I think is kind of pivotal to Apple's relationship with developers is that in the nineties, and you know this better than I, so you can fill in the details here, but hardware sales started to tank. Things started to get really rocky for Apple and they got to this point where third-party developers had so much power over Apple that if Adobe wasn't updating their apps on the Mac platform and simultaneously the Windows platform had taken off at that point where they were probably, I assume making way more money on the Windows platform. It was kind of the platform to be on during that time, but Apple desperately needed those third-party developers to continue building for the platform to keep the platform sustainable. And that all kind of culminated in 1997 with the famous Steve Jobs standing in an auditorium with a giant screen of Bill Gates behind him and Microsoft saving Apple. And again, people who haven't studied the history or been around or not old men like you and I couldn't even fathom that Microsoft saved Apple. Had Microsoft not done that, Apple would've gone bankrupt. So fill in some of the gaps there. What happened in the nineties and how did Apple get into this desperate point where third-party developers had so much power over them needing Microsoft to save the company. John Gruber: I think point one that gets overlooked a lot in the years where Jobs was exiled from Apple, who knows what would've happened. Maybe that was for the best that he went and founded... It worked out well for him to go found Next, struggle to make next a thing and then have Next in Apple. I always call it a reunification rather than an acquisition because it really is so obvious. I mean, Craig Federighi's first job out of college was at Next and it's like he left for a while, right? Scott Forstall, but where Apple got lost in those years, one of the ways, and I think I haven't seen a lot of people or a lot of books focus on it, was the sort of mindset in the early PC years, a company would come out with a new computer and the computer was the platform effectively, and there wasn't really this idea, there wasn't so much of you'd make the Commodore 64 and then when Commodore came out with the Commodore 128, I forget if you could run Commodore 64 programs, but it was sort of a new computer. It was like, ah, this is a different computer. And then Commodore came out with Amiga is sort of an overlooked thing in history and I know the panic guys were big Amiga fans and the Amiga had the video toaster was doing digital video editing way before any other computer platform. It had some amazing capabilities, but Commodore just exemplifies it. Commodore 64 was a hit, then the 128 not so much of a hit, then the Amiga, which was way more capable. But that every couple of years the idea was there'd be like a new thing and backwards compatibility was like a maybe and it would be like a mode, but basically you'd sort of come out with an all new thing every couple years as opposed to evolving a platform over decades. It just didn't enter Apple's mind. And so Apple had all of these failed next generation, what's going to come after the Macintosh things in the late eighties and especially the early nineties, Pink and Taligent, and it's all confusing and it would take forever to explain as opposed to what was an operating system and what was a company and what was a cross-platform like? Taligent was sort of a cross company thing with IBM where it was in addition to an operating system, they'd make a new platform and the power PC chip architecture sort of came out of that. And so it wasn't totally futile, but the idea wasn't to how do we keep evolving the Macintosh? It was what comes after the Macintosh. That's the fundamental flaw. And the Newton is laughed at in some ways and other ways people are like, oh man, they're sort of a decade ahead of in terms of you'd have a handheld thing in your hand with a touchscreen, but the most obvious problem with the Newton was that something handheld that needs ubiquitous wireless networking. And there wasn't even Wi-Fi at the time, let alone cellular. Palm Pilot was sort of more of a hit, but mostly because it was affordable. And people like me, I had one, I had a handspring visor and I liked it. In hindsight, there's a lot of younger people who probably vaguely have heard of Palm Pilots, but it wasn't that big a deal. At the time, people are like, oh, the Palm Pilot is what Apple should have made with the Newton. No, because even the Palm Pilot really wasn't that big of a hit and it didn't have any staying power because it didn't do networking, it didn't have a connection to the internet, even Wi-Fi, let alone cellular. That's really what a handheld needed. But the other thing about the Newton that was just as important to its failure was it really hardly related to the Macintosh at all. There was a Newton, I forget what it's called, Newton Sink Utility or something, and you connect a serial cable to your Mac and Newton, you could sync some things, but like I said earlier, there was no contact app on the Mac from Apple. So where did your Newton contacts go? The Newton had a contacts app because it was a personal digital assistant and they had all of these things about what comes after the Macintosh when what they should have clearly been thinking of is how do we move the Macintosh forward? And meanwhile, while Apple's core interest and at the top level of the company was interested on these big expensive, all-failed next generation, what comes after the Macintosh? There were people at Apple who were grinding away on the Macintosh, putting out system seven and then system 7.1, system 7.5 and sort of keeping the company alive financially because that's an actual platform that people were using and buying. And I think at the highest level, Apple was looking at that the way that the Macintosh part of the company was looking at the Apple II in the eighties. And for most of those mid to late eighties, Apple was staying alive financially through Apple II sales, not Macintosh sales. And they were thinking, that's what the Macintosh is doing now and we will get pink or Copeland or whatever this thing is. Copeland was a next generation Mac. That was where they started to get it through their head that, oh, what we really need to do is keep the Mac alive and come up with something. They just wasted half a decade of great still explosive new stuff coming out. The whole internet thing happened in the midst of that where there was no internet to speak of. I mean, the internet existed, but it was like a university type thing in 1991 and by 1993, 4, 5, it was like, oh, Netscape is a huge thing. Meanwhile, Microsoft was doing the opposite with Windows where they're like Windows One, nobody used, nobody even heard of Windows Two, nobody used, nobody heard of. Windows Three, now people are using it instead of DOS, but it was really clunky and awful and they're like, let's make a better one. Let's make one that steals interface ideas from Next where the buttons and stuff look 3D and have gray scale. And they were grinding away on making the thing that was sort of a hit just a little better every couple years. And Apple just lost half a decade in that period. And thankfully they had people who were incrementally making the Macintosh better, but then they'd sort of painted themselves in a corner where the Macintosh operating system, not to get too super nerdy, but was still fundamentally based on some assumptions from the mid-eighties about how low level all software worked and the idea of preemptive multitasking where a program crashing couldn't possibly crash the whole computer because it would just be the program. Whereas the Macintosh was so low level and all programs sort of made some low level assumptions where they were, there was no kernel to speak of in computer science terms in that classic macOS. And they were doing things with low level memory where like, hey, if Internet Explorer froze up, your whole computer might just freeze. And then you had to literally use the power button on the hardware to restart it and anything you had open that wasn't saved was gone. In 1984, 85, 86, that's the way a computer like the Macintosh had to work. There was no option to do preemptive multitasking and have memory safe applications in that era because of the constraints of the hardware. But by 1995, 96, that was totally possible and it was obviously the way it should be, but there was no simple way to just say that's how the next version of macOS is going to work. And all of the existing apps like Photoshop and Excel and Microsoft Word will just work. There was no way. It was too incompatible. And that's what you were talking about earlier where Apple was up against it because the only reason the Macintosh was thriving was because of these apps from companies... And the big ones were Adobe and Microsoft, and if their existing apps didn't continue to work, there was no way anybody was going to upgrade to whatever they came up with no matter what its technical capabilities. David Barnard: And so then being back against the wall and Jobs having gone off to Next and built that next iteration, the Next revolution in computing the foundation for everything we do today was what Jobs built at Next, they acquired Next in 96 and Jobs comes back and then that's what leads up to this Microsoft committing to the platform, investing money into Apple. And then I wanted to read a quote, and this is going to be long, and those of you who really care can go back and watch. There's a video of this is that at WWDC in 1997. There's a quote from Jobs. A developer asked about OpenDoc, so I [inaudible 00:55:54] all this, but we can skip over the details of it because I think the details are less important, but Apple decided to kill this technology, OpenDoc and the developer very frustrated, goes up to the mic at WWDC during an open mic session with Steve Jobs at WWDC in 97. Very frustrated, why are you killing this thing? We've invested a lot of money into it and I want to read the quote. I kind of jump around in the quote because it would take 10 minutes to read, but let me read this quote from Steve Jobs because I think it's just so fascinating. "I know some of you spent a lot of time working on stuff that we put a bullet in the head of, I apologize, I feel your pain." I wanted to get that in there because can you imagine Apple in 2025 saying, I apologize, I feel your pain and just the rest of this is so good. John Gruber: I can imagine it, but it would be very surprising and I feel like that's exactly what they could use, but yes. David Barnard: Yeah, that's what we're going to get to and that's why I wanted these quotes. We'll come back to it maybe an hour from now when we get deeper into the iPhone stuff. So continuing, it's skipping around the quote, but "focusing is about saying no. Focusing is about saying no and you've got to say no, no, no. And when you say no, you off people. So you take your lumps and Apple has been taking their share of lumps for the past six months in a very unfair way, and it's been taking them like an adult, and I'm proud of that." Man, Steve Jobs off the cuff. I miss that. I miss that so much. "And the result of that focus is going to be some really great products where the total is much greater than the sum of the parts." So again, that's missing a lot of context. It's missing a lot of the actual quote. You can go back and watch the video. I'll put it in the show notes, but I just thought that was so fascinating that Apple in '97 was at this point that Steve Jobs of all people was there on stage answering this kind of question with a level of kind of humility and self-awareness that, "Hey, developers are so important. I feel your pain. I'm sorry, I apologize. But then also clearly talking to the future of like, hey, this is going to be hard, but we're building towards something." And they included that quote specifically from what you were alluding to is that in this forty-year history with developers, there have been moments like that where you see a more open Apple, a more contrite Apple, and that the success of the iPhone has really changed the way I feel like Apple does relate to developers and Apple has not had to take its lumps in a good 20 or 30 years and has not had that level of forthrightness and humility with developers when things do go sideways, and this is where I think Ben Thompson has said multiple times on different podcasts and articles he's written, I think some people inside Apple view this and maybe those three top execs who've been there this whole time and a lot of people inside Apple, it felt humiliating, not humble. And that this was a period in their history that they were so beholden to third-party developers and they never wanted to be in that position again. They never wanted to have to take lumps again. They never wanted to be on that verge of bankruptcy. They never wanted to feel that pain and be humiliated like that again versus I go back and I read this, I'm like, wow, what a great example of just how much goodwill do you instill in developers in the entire ecosystem by speaking like that to developers? John Gruber: The first thing I'll say to that is that of those three executives you've mentioned, Eddie Kew, Jaws, and Schiller. Schiller's the exception where Schiller, I know you probably know this, actually hasn't been in Apple continuously since 1987 or whatever, and in the early nineties he was, I forget where else, but he ended up at Macromedia, which was the company behind PageMaker, or maybe not... No, I forget, but they had... They were the competitor to Adobe, and so Schiller has been on the other side of that divide making the essential tools for the Mac. That just helps add to that same perspective though of knowing how much leverage those companies had over Apple. And the two things that were scarring to Apple were the near bankruptcy. And so it's made the company institutionally incredibly frugal and more so while Jaws was still alive, it was only after Jaws died and Cook took over that they started doing things like shareholder buybacks and stuff while Jaws was alive. They were just hoarding their profits. They just were putting it into that Braeburn Capital subsidiary and just sitting on an ever-growing mountain of cash because in the same way that my grandparents who had been through the Great Depression would eat, scrape every single bit of food off their plate and thought it was offensive, no matter whether you thought it tasted good or whether you were still hungry, it was offensive not to eat every bit of food offered to you because they remembered not having enough food and the parts of the company that remembered being on the verge of bankruptcy, in some ways it helps focus the company, but in some ways in the long run sort of hurt them. And I think having somebody new like Tim Cook, again, he's been there a long time, but he wasn't there for the near bankruptcy part or came in just after, and so he wasn't as scarred by it. But I think that developer relations part definitely has, now that Apple has gotten big, has hurt them. That they're still so thinking of themselves as underdogs who want to assert not dominance over developers from their perspective, but having at least 51% of the power over developers that they've lost the fact that they've actually got 95% of the power or however you want to assign the power dynamic in the current state. They're so hell-bent on making sure they never fall below 51% of the power between the platform and the developers that they've just lost sight of how overwhelmingly they've already won and how much it would be in their interest to make concessions because of the surplus of power that they have to bolster developer goodwill. I don't think we're putting them on a hypothetical psychiatrist couch, but they do remember it. It's infused their thinking about the company. David Barnard: And we will put a pin in that to come back to as we talk about the more modern era of lawsuits and regulation and everything else like that, but stepping back and walking through the history, you do see a different apple after that. And so Apple does go on to build keynote and pages and numbers and the whole digital hub and they start building more and more of those key pieces of software. I think in part from that scarred time of we want to make sure there's great software for the average user and we're going to bundle it even though that's in conflict with our third party developers. We're going to give things away free or cheap, and you see a different Apple in that early 2000 era of like, we're going to control our destiny. Third party developers are important. We're going to be a platform. We're going to encourage them, but we're going to cover our own bases. We're going to make sure that we're not beholden to these companies in the long run by doing these things. And then kind of the next era as I was going through all of this, and this is where I kind of step into it, is what I was calling the Delicious Era. And there were these at the time, going all the way back to the eighties, kind of smaller passionate developers, but I feel like the heyday of this passionate small developer time was those early 2000s. You had Delicious Monster Building, Delicious Library and Panic and the Omni Group and Rogue Amoeba, and you could probably... Bare Bones, you could probably list another 20 off the top of your head, and there was this kind of renaissance. The iPod started driving more and more people from Windows to the Mac. There were these really passionate kind of fanboy developers building these really cool software for the platform. And as a platform, I feel like there was a bit of a heyday during that time where Apple was kind of... And Sherlocking famously came out of the Watson Sherlock thing in, I think, that was 2020, but there was this kind of heyday leading up to the iPhone of really great independent software creators while at the same time Microsoft and Adobe and others were starting to invest more back into the platform and the Mac becomes this really solid platform in that era. John Gruber: It's a tough thing to strike a balance on. It's almost impossible to just get perfectly right where it's clearly correct for there to be a suite of fundamental apps out of the box in a factory fresh new computer or phone or tablet. And that therefore that 1990 to 1995 Apple mindset of we're hardly going to ship any first party apps and everything will be third party apps because we don't want to step on their toes. And even if we have a subsidiary that makes Mac Write and Mac Draw and stuff like that, or File Maker, we're going to put it in a subsidiary and try to treat it as best we can as an actual third party developer, even though we own the company. That's not the right way to deal with a platform, but obviously Sherlocking every successful app is also not the right mindset. It's a hard balance to strike, and I think they've managed it pretty well, especially... And again, in the early 2000s when Sherlocking first became a term, it was so few years since the era when Apple studiously avoided ever stepping on the toes of third party developers, that it felt like all of this was newly offensive. And here in 2025, that's sort of ancient history. And so people don't think of it that way. So for example, just this month at WWDC, they announced clipboard history management in Sherlock on macOS Tahoe and a sort of more launch bar, Alfred Ray cast style superpowers in Spotlight where you can assign a two letter abbreviation to something to launch a shortcut or something like that. I think that they continue to strike the right balance where I, as a long time launch bar user, I'm glad they're adding those features to Spotlight, but there's 0% chance that I'm switching to Spotlight. I have an example though where here's a market where I feel like they tried to stay away from third parties and I think it bit them and now they're entering late, which is password management. And OnePassword is a great app from a great company that used to make a really great Mac app for passwords, and they're still a good company and the app is still fine. I've never been a user of it, but I see why people are. But the dynamic is the more popular and successful OnePassword came, the more that grew and they grew in interest to want to reach the enterprise market. And that changed the product in a way that made it not so great as a Apple product, an Apple platform product. OnePassword is still a great product, super good at a technical level, super useful in that enterprise context and in terms of some of the family sharing and stuff like that. But it's like if you really want the Mac style interface for password integration and the iPhone style integration and the syncing between the two, it started becoming not as great as it used to be because their interest in growing their market, which is great for the company, were in conflict with making it perfect for the Apple platforms. And so Apple came out with Apple passwords I think last year. I think it's only been a year, maybe it's two years. David Barnard: I don't know. It's been... Well, I mean, the password app, but they've been kind slow rolling into building the password app. John Gruber: It was effectively an app worth more than an app, a serious app worth of capabilities and features, but hidden away in a system settings panel for years, I think out of deference to we don't want to squash this market. But then I think as the market sort of moved into a less and less idiomatic Apple platform style of software, they were like, you know what? We should just make our own app because we could do this in a way that's very Apple-y. And I think now the new passwords app, it's a good introduction to how do you make a modern app for Apple platforms? Any area where they try to stay out of, eventually they find themselves having to enter. David Barnard: Yeah, so this is a huge can of worms that we could spend an hour talking about the balance of Apple, what they ship and what they don't, and what developers' toes they step on and what they don't. Maybe this is a whole nother podcast, but I want to step back and- David Barnard: Maybe this is a whole another podcast. I wanted to step back and see if there was anything else you wanted to share relating to the 2000s in that. I feel like that era did actually set Apple up really well for the iPhone as a platform. The Cocoa frameworks, the passionate developer base, the books that were written. When I started working on iOS, I intended to be the programmer and do it all myself. And so I bought the famous book of the era, Aaron Hillegass, Cocoa frameworks or whatever it was. And so by the time you got to the iPhone, there was this really solid, passionate community. Books being written, conferences being attended. WWDC had grown tremendously, and this era of the 2000s of the Mac becoming this really great platform was a springboard that then propelled the iPhone even faster as a platform than I think it would've otherwise been. Is there anything else you wanted to talk about that era before we jump into the iPhone era? John Gruber: The basic mindset in the late '90s in the industry was a sort of consensus that user interface design doesn't matter that much. Nobody would argue it doesn't matter at all, but that Apple's focus on making it the top priority of their platforms wasn't worth it because, okay, let's just concede that the Mac was a better user interface than Windows. Look at their market share. Obviously it didn't matter. It wasn't an unreasonable conclusion, but I think it was wrong-headed because I think that the problem that people arguing that way didn't see yet was that no computer. Again, it comes back to that argument that the iPhone is truly the first real personal computer, the one that every person would want and would care about. At the time, even in the late '90s, too many people making decisions about what computers to buy or what computers a company should buy weren't the people who care that much about user interface and therefore they were buying Windows PCs based on other criteria. Those early 2000s that built up this skill set in designers and developers and built up these teams of either companies or independents or just hobbyists, but at every level who could make software that was like, oh man, just look at it. Remember the Disco app. It was a DVD burning utility. When it burned the DVD, it actually had smoke come out of the window. Some people were like, well, that's just a complete waste of CPU and GPU resources, and other people were like, where do I buy this? I want to buy this because when I burn a CD or DVD, I want smoke to come out of the window because that's just cool and fun. This whole skill set was there for Apple and in 2008 when the app store opened up to build apps that people would just be like, but just look at it. Just look at this. Oh yeah, where do I get that app? I want to get it. It fueled this consumer fervor for the platform that no other platform could even hope to compete with at the time. There was no other platform. Early Android, they just couldn't do it. Microsoft's mobile, Blackberry, whatever. Nobody had the skill set. It was impossible to make anything that was like, just look at it. Just look at this app. Look how cool it looks. David Barnard: Yeah. I hadn't thought about it from that. The design perspective as well. I mean, that's what brought me to iPhone development. We'll move into the iPhone era now, is that I was that uber passionate Apple fanboy, Mac nerd. I had my, I don't even know what it was at the time, in 2007, some PowerBook that I had at the time. I loved the software, I loved the platform. I was first person, not first person in line. Well, I was first person in line to buy an iPhone. I was in line. Again, if you weren't around and weren't a fanboy at the time, it's laughable to think about this at the time, but I stood in line for, I think it was my iOS, Mac OS Tiger or one of those. There would be lines at the Apple Store and OS Update was a launch event. John Gruber: You had to pay $129 for it. David Barnard: Yes. You would line up to pay $120 to upgrade your operating system. It was that passion about the platform at that time that you had people like me and millions of us around the country who cared so deeply about the platform for all of these reasons is that it wasn't just good hardware, it wasn't just the OS, but it was this combination of OS and fun software and delightful, but it was productive. In 2003, I actually bought that 17 inch PowerBook because I was using Photoshop to manipulate this aerial photography for my dad's commercial real estate business. The Windows laptop I was on kept crashing. I was like, dad, I got to get a Mac if you want me to keep working on this stuff. Went and paid for it. The experience was night and day working on Photoshop on a 17-inch PowerBook than it was whatever crappy Windows machine I was using at the time. And so there was this fervor for the platform in that time that I think was the perfect setup. And also coming into the iPhone, there was enough of that groundswell of people like me. I was in China when Apple announced the iPhone. I went to the internet cafe at a Beijing hotel to watch a live blog of the Macworld keynote that you were at when they announced the original iPhone because there was just that level of fervor. And then six months later, my brother and I go get in line to buy the first iPhone. There was that passion, and then by the time they announced the SDK that next year, I jumped into it because I thought this is going to be something. I saw something different about the platform, and so much of that had been built up through Apple's experience across the decades building platforms of the turnaround of the Mac, of building the foundations with Cocoa and stuff like that. That ended up becoming the iPhone. And then by the time the iPhone App Store was released, there was this groundswell of developers who were just so excited about the platform. They could not build an app for this platform. It wasn't just original Mac developers. That was one of the fascinating things, you alluded to it earlier, is that a lot of the Mac developers didn't really do well on the iPhone because they were maybe a little too caught up in what they had built for the Mac. What we saw happen when the App Store launched with so many new companies being built, new ideas being explored, and just this fervor for building for the platform. John Gruber: There was a skill set that transferred immediately where somebody who is really fluent as a developer in Objective-C and the AppKit APIs on the Mac could immediately jump over, because it was just more limited. It was like AppKit but a lot more limited. But in terms of the syntax and the style of the APIs, they could just jump right in and thrive in a way that a developer who's familiar with Java at the time, which was super popular, or the Windows C++ APIs was like, what the hell's going on here with all the square brackets? But in terms of the concepts for what an app should be and do in the scope of it, it wasn't a mini Mac. It still isn't, but especially in 2008, 2009, it just was so much more limited and the context of where and how people would use it was so different that it just at a conceptual level be thinking in a very different way, not quite as profound. But along the lines of the difference between the purely command line interfaces of the early PC era where you just had text on a screen versus a graphical user interface. It was the same difference where it was like, hey, people are just going to sometimes open your app and want to use it like tap, tap done and get out. You could have Mac apps at the time where you'd launch the app and it would show a splash screen. It was a whole term of art like, Photoshop and Adobe apps famously would take 30, 40 seconds to launch because they were such big apps. Well, that made no sense on the iPhone. If you had that mindset like, I have this idea for an app, but it's going to take 20 seconds to launch, well, people would just be like, nah, screw this. I'm hitting the home button and deleting the app before it finished launching. David Barnard: To bring back the developer relations thread, WWDC 2008, which you were at, one of my big regrets in life is not going to WWDC 2008 because I founded my company April of that year to build iPhone apps. I had borrowed money from my family. I felt this tension of am I spending my family's hard-earned money that they've invested in me to go on a vacation to San Francisco to this developer conference? And so I did not go. What I heard in retrospect was that they were actually signing up developer accounts in person at WWDC that year. Could have been there day one had I gone, but this was the first time WWDC ever sold out. I've heard stories about past WWDC. They would be giving away tickets. They would be begging developers to come, and at WWDC 2008 was the first time it sold out. And then from then on, that groundswell of developer and the platform becoming so powerful, they never again had to ask developers to come. It was sold out every year after that, eventually having to go to a lottery. And then there's one more point I wanted to make was that at WWDC 2008, the slides from the presentations had the email addresses of Apple evangelists on the slide because they're like, hey, email us. We need more feedback. We want to know what's going on. Even as successful as the Mac platform had become, this was still pre iPhone Apple and pre the iPhone platform becoming what it became was such a different Apple. Funny story, because I had not gotten a developer account, I sent an email to five of the people- John Gruber: On the slides. David Barnard: On the slides. John Galenzi of all people responded to the email, gave me a phone call. I mean, to this day I remember he actually just retired from Apple. I had a lovely chat with him a couple of weeks ago at WWDC on the side because he's no longer at Apple anymore. John Gruber: No, he's no longer at Apple, but I saw him at WWDC. David Barnard: Yeah. Such an incredible human. But evangelists would put their email on the slides. It's just hard in 2025 how secretive, how close, how we choose you, you don't choose us. How hard it is to get the attention of Apple for the average developer. That was the era before the iPhone platform became so big. John Gruber: It was clearly a surprise to Apple. The whole idea that jobs had to be talked into opening up an API. I think that's overstated a little to some degree. I was going to say how much of that was just him blustering? Well, the difference is between should there be third-party apps for iPhone versus should the iPod support Windows. Now, Jobs wholeheartedly was against supporting Windows. He really was 100% on board with the iPod as a thing to help sell the Mac. Making it a Mac-only peripheral was in Apple's interest because it would bolster the Mac and every other executive from Schiller to whoever else was like, we're holding back the iPod as a platform by not supporting Windows. There's multiple books that he have written about it where he's like, all right, fine, go do it, but don't bother me. I don't want to know about it. And then he called it the iTunes for Windows, the Glass of ice water in hell. He was happy once it came out and he could see it and he could say that, he was happy, but he was really against it. I don't think he was against opening the iPhone, I just think he thought someday. I do think that maybe it happened a little faster than he thought. I don't think he anticipated announcing it in 2007. In fact, at 2007, WWDC was when they announced their "sweet solution" for third party developers, which was a very small JavaScript library where you could make some web apps that looked like native iPhone apps. They wouldn't have announced that in June on the cusp of the iPhone going on sale if they really thought, hey, we're going to have a native SDK early next year. It was September, October where they just made an announcement like, sure, all right, fine. We heard you. We're going to open an SDK. Give us a couple of months to get it together. We'll get back to you when it's ready. I think he thought it was like, we'll get to it in a couple of years, but I think it already was proving more popular and more resonant than he thought. I think Jobs and everybody at Apple knew this iPhone was a hit. They knew it was a thing. They weren't surprised that it was in sensation when they announced it, but it was even more resonant and more of a hit and bled out to more normal people. The iPhone first came out in 2007, right away in the summer of 2007, I'd be at Whole Foods and I'd have a shopping list in a Web App and Randos would just come up to me and be like, is that an iPhone? Is that an iPhone. All the time. I don't think Apple was anticipating that level of broad consumer appeal and it accelerated that. The WWDC thing is a perfect example. Before the iPhone, they had a whole extra track at WWDC. They called it the IT Track for IT professionals who managed Mac installations in corporate environments. It was because they had room, I don't know, I'm just ball parking, 3000 developers, but then 2000 IT professionals and a whole different track of sessions where instead of talking about APIs for making Mac Apps, it was sessions related to the very serious, a reasonable topic for a conference, but it was almost like two conferences in one. One for developers and one for IT professionals, just because they wanted to fill up Moscone and they had room. With the iPhone, it was like, oh, we got to get rid of that. There was this whole resentment because, it was I think a very good and successful and popular conference for IT professionals, but when the popularity of the iPhone happened, it was like, oh, they got to go. And then it became, even Mac developers felt like, hey, this used to be all about the Mac and now it's session after session after session is just about the iPhone. David Barnard: We've talked about a lot of things that are ultimately almost a fluke of history that things played out the way they did from Bill Gates saving Apple and all those things. I can't help but think. I wish I could remember their names to give them credit for it, but very soon after the iPhone was released, the developers jailbroke the iPhone and started writing native apps for it. Craig Hockenberry is one name I will call out. I wonder if that jailbreak scene and seeing what developers were building under insane constraints. Because when you jailbroke, Apple hadn't documented APIs. It wasn't a real SDK. Developers were having to reverse engineer methods they could call and how things were working. I can't help but think that some of jobs changing his mind so quickly was because of how innovative and how passionate that base was. I mean, I ended up buying it. When I started my company, I bought a second iPhone because I was too nervous to jailbreak my own iPhone. I bought a second iPhone, jailbroke it and installed all these apps for me as a way to study what apps could do. It's like you could study as a developer in 2008 before the App Store was launched and you had 500 apps to poke around to see what people were doing. I jailbroke a phone specifically to understand what could be done and what people were doing and what was going on with the platform. I can't help but think that Hockenberry and Steve Troughton-Smith and some of those other early jailbreak folks had an influence on the SDK actually coming out as quickly as it did. John Gruber: Yeah. I think Jobs appreciated that. Lucas Newman, who was at the Luscious library at the time and then went to Apple. I think it got him hired by Apple. I haven't heard from him in a while. I also know that, I think this is a public story, but Lucas Newman wrote the first game. It was called Lights Off, wholly backwards engineered, entirely. Hockenberry came out with a version of Twitterrific that was a native app before the year was out without any SDK from Apple, but building apps for the iPhone through Xcode. Just bananas to me that this happened. But I think Jobs appreciated that mindset because of all the crazy nonsense him and Woz had done back in the day before they founded was. Before they founded Apple making the little blue boxes that would let you make free long-distance calls on a payphone and stuff. The enthusiasm was just so much stronger where it was like they'd be crazy not to hold it back. David Barnard: Then March 6th, 2008 a date seared into my memory, they announced the iPhone SDK. This is again where I think people in 2025 don't appreciate what a different era that was in terms of what was possible as a developer to build a business. I wrote a business investment thesis that I sent to my dad and mom and uncle who ultimately invested in the company. I specifically wrote in there, what an incredible deal this is that I don't have to host my own store. Because back then, I mean, again, so easy to forget in this era of Stripe and AWS back ends and everything like that, that standing up your own web server to distribute apps, especially if it's a larger app, could get very expensive. Bandwidth was expensive. Working with third-party, payment platforms was a hassle. You needed a whole team to sort all that stuff out. And so when Apple announced the iPhone- John Gruber: Especially on a phone, right? David Barnard: Yeah. John Gruber: Credit card would be even harder. There was no way to scan it, no tap to pay. David Barnard: The only software that was on phones at the time was carrier build. You had to do a deal with a carrier and they took 50% of everything. The App Store was genuinely a revolution in software of a revolution of opportunity for developer. I mean, this is what I built my career on. This is why I have such a soft place in my heart and I'm so obsessed to this day with the App Store because it just fundamentally changed the opportunity you had as a developer to build a business. Of course that's not true anymore in 2025 with Stripe and hosted Back ends and Bandwidth being essentially free and all these third-party SaaS tools that you could spin up a Web App. I mean, geez, now even in Vibe coding where you don't even need a backend or hardly any experience to spin up a Web App that's just hosted on Replit. You can charge for it via built-in payment solutions. It's just crazy how much different the world is today than it was for that original App Store release. I think people today forget just how powerful that was. We were talking about this before we hit record trying to do the math. There are kids today, teenagers releasing apps on the App Store whose parents probably weren't even alive when Schiller and Cue and Joswiak joined Apple in the '80s. You could be a 16-year-old developer with a 40-year-old parent who wasn't even alive when all of this started with the Macintosh in 1984, much less 1976 when Apple was founded. I think there is a little bit of a loss of history and then maybe at Apple a little too much recognition of history of here we are in 2025 and the world has completely changed. The iPhone helped change the world 17 years ago, but now it's been 17 years since the world changed. People today looking from the outside without this history, I don't think appreciate the things that Apple appreciates. They don't have the context and the history. I think when you're trying to understand how Apple operates, why they're so insistent on the App Store fees and other things like that, you have to ignore all of that history, which to people's credit they don't even know. That's why we're doing this podcast. To understand Apple, you have to go back those 40 years and see all of what it took to get to the iPhone and then the iPhone becoming the platform it is and the billions and trillions of dollars that the platform has generated for third-party developers, that's hard not to just appreciate. John Gruber: To some extent at this point, it's becoming clear that Apple itself has fallen into the same trap. I'll exemplify it with a quote. I've been thinking about this a lot. I'm hopefully going to soon turn it into some article on Daring Fireball. There's a Steve Jobs quote. It's actually, Apple's made a big plaque of it, huge. It's, I don't know, 10 feet diagonal. It hangs not at Apple Park, but outside the Town Hall Theatre at the old Infinite Loop campus. The quote is, if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what's next. I think with the App Store in particular, boy that really resonate. It's not that they should forgo all profit and all commissions from the App Store, the whole, well, we started with 70/30. We should stick with 70/30. We've never raised it from 70/30 even when it's become more powerful or more monopoly, whatever you want to call it. David Barnard: As they've increased in control and the platform has increased in importance, they could have increased and squeezed and other things. John Gruber: Right. The people at Apple who are insisting on keeping as much of the commission's and the rules and everything as they have, but especially when it comes to payments and letting people link out to the web and stuff like that. They're thinking, hey, we built this thing that was so much more generous and developer friendly than everything that came before it on handhelds or, especially on phones. That they're still caught up in thinking of what it was in 2008 as opposed to that Jobs's quote, if you build something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. I feel like Apple is dwelling on the success and the innovation, true innovation, profound innovation that absolutely shook up and completely revolutionized the phone industry more than Apple even revolutionized the PC industry, but they're dwelling on it for too long. That they should move on and build something else new and start conceding on that issue. I think it is something that they've lost when they lost Steve Jobs. People think that they lost the ability to make new things, that it was always his ability to drive them to make a new thing. But I think he was good at, okay, fine. Again, I mentioned that whole iPod for Windows thing where he stuck with it for a year or two and then he was like, okay, fine, fine. At some point the people holding onto all of these rules and healing all these decisions about the anti-steering and stuff. Somebody at the top named Tim Cook should probably just say, okay, fine, fine. Let's just give in on a lot of this. We don't have to worry about it anymore. Just clear it off our concerns. I think it would be so good for Apple to just clear it off the table and just clear their time and their energy and their talent from executives down to engineers to just figure out what's next and make something new that would build into something where they have to worry about this again in 10 or 15 years. David Barnard: I want to dig into what I will affectionately call App Store 3.0 because I completely agree, but let's step back one more point in history. I have a bunch of notes. We could go through all of the early iPhone days. It's hard for people who don't even know that there weren't in-app purchases, that you had paid upgrades. That in order to do a paid upgrade, you had to release a whole new app and then transition users to it. There's so many points on the App Store history of just oddities and stubbornness and weird things that Apple did in those early days, even as the platform started taking off. But in 2016, Phil Schiller did a round of interviews. I think the one that most concisely covers it, maybe the one he gave the most access to was Verge. They titled the article App Store 2.0. And so in hindsight now I will give this way more credit than I think I did at the time of, it really was App Store 2.0. It really did fuel what we see as the current era of the platform. They open up subscriptions to all apps, which obviously working at RevenueCat and now all my apps are subscription. I know some users still bulk at it, but from a developer's perspective and being able to fund the creation of great software and continue working on it, that was revolution. That was App Store 2.0 to empower developers to better monetize apps. They sped up app review significantly. Again, if you weren't around a decade ago, you don't remember the days when it was seven days, 14 days to get an app through App Review. As much as you might complain about App Review today, at least you get that rejection in 24 hours to 48 hours instead of seven to 14 business days. They dropped the commission to 15% on year one renewal. If you started a subscription, that first commission would be 30, and then after that would be 15%. They announced App Store search ads as a new way to pay to get users. As much as we can complain about name squatting and having to pay to defend your brand, it's an incredible opportunity to be able to pay and get in front of people right there in the App Store. It's actually the paid acquisition channel that I recommend any App Store with. If you're struggling to get downloads, the first thing you should do is start figuring App Store search ads. That was App Store 2.0. They started removing a lot of these old apps that weren't working or just crappy apps. They started to purge the App Store and curate it a little bit more. That was App Store 2.0 in 2016. Looking back now almost a decade since. It really was a profound shift in the App Store that has led to so much of what we now get to experience as the App Store would not have happened had they not loosened the reins in those ways and made those changes. And so as much as we talk about, I complain on Twitter about Apple being obstinate and not changing and being stuck in the past and everything like that. The App Store 2.0 was them changing. Did they go on an apology tour? Did they, whatever? No. But they made very fundamental changes to the App Store that propelled it for this last decade. To your point, this is what I want to get back to today in 2025, is that it really does feel like we are in need of App Store 3.0, a deeper, more fundamental rethink of the opportunity. I think to your point, get out of the way. Let developers build. I think the Vision Pro is a good example too of the animosity that has started to build up. The frustrations and everything has gotten to a point where developers are way more wary of Apple. You posted some really great posts this spring, Apple, you're killing my vibe, and then another one by John Siracusa, just about developers seeing Apple more and more as a inconvenience to reaching their users versus a partner in building this incredible platform. The iPhone continues to sell like hotcakes. Apps are making money hand over fist. Developers are building apps, new apps every day. From the outside and looking at the numbers, maybe the platform is fine, but I think this sentiment where developer relations are in 2025 with the lawsuits, with the DMA, with all of the things that are going on, it feels like we're due another reset. Personally, I would love to that be a little bit more like the '97 jobs of like, hey, we did some things that we thought were right at the time and the forthrightness to say, here's why we think this. Here's why we did it. We're changing our mind. We're going to focus on building these great platforms moving forward. What does Apple need for the next decade and the decade after a vibrant developer community who's going to jump on the next day AI platform. Meta and Google and OpenAI and others are tromping at the bit and have billions of dollars to invest to not let this next platform play out the way the smartphone platform played out with Apple having so much control and so much power, maybe it's time for a bigger change. John Gruber: It's just proven so lucrative and forms the backbone of their services, "services that they report financially," which has been their growth vector for the last, I don't know, seven or eight years. Not because interest in the iPhone has decreased, but because clearly the iPhone is literally so popular that every single person in the world who lives somewhere where the iPhone is available and they can afford one and they want one has one. It's that popular that it has peaked because they've run out of people to sell it to. To their credit, it's part of the appeal that they build them to last. That's good for the environment. It's good as just a message that they're durable and the silicon is so good that five, six-year-old iPhones are still very credible devices. I'm running iOS 26 on an iPad from 2018, iPad Pro. It is a little slow. That's a seven-year-old device. The "services" has been their growth for the last seven or eight years. A lot of that comes not, they would like you to think that it's from Apple services, from people paying for iCloud and paying for Apple TV+ and whatever else they sell as a service. But a lot of it comes from their commission from the App Store, but they could decrease their cut and they could open up instead of fighting for these anti-steering things, especially going to the web stuff, which I've been against for years and years. I mean, pretty much ever since it became an issue that this is ridiculous. Especially like in the Kindle exemplifies it. That if the terms of the App Store are such that the Kindle App cannot sell app or books in the app without losing money on each book, which is the way the e-book publishing industry works, where there's a 70/30 split between the bookseller and the publisher and therefore if there's a 70/30 split between the publisher and the platform, they literally lose money on each sale that they'd owe. A $10 book, they would owe $3 to Apple, but they would owe $7 to the publisher and therefore at best would make nothing, so why do it? If you can't sell books through the app because of the terms of your store, you should absolutely let them have a button that says, go here to go buy books on the Kindle website. The idea that they fought that is, it's just absurd, and clearly anti-user. It just exemplifies how they've gotten caught up in thinking way too much that the point of the App Store is for Apple to get a commission on all digital content sales for the platform as opposed to what it should be and could be and should remain going forward, which is... John Gruber: ... could be and should remain going forward which is us maintaining control and having approval over the software and the APIs and what can happen in the background and how things are managed and how privacy is managed in the sandbox and everything is the best for the platform long-term and very much the best interest of the users. It should be that thinking. And then, the fact that we make a lot of money but maybe not as much money for all digital content on the platform because we do have and one of the ways you can do in-app purchases should be icing on the cake, which is clearly how they thought of it at the outset and they should just go back to thinking that. And I really do think that if and when they do, and I think it's a big if, but... And not at the point of regulation. Because if it's at the point of regulation, we see it. They're just going to make it convoluted and complex and the only way this knot is going to get untied is for Apple to willingly say, "You know what? We're going to lower the rate to 80-20 for everyone and 90-10 for small business," or something like that, "And we're going to just drop... If you want to send people outside the app to the web to make the purchases, just give them a button and they'll go to the web to do it." If they did that, I honestly think they would not see a significant decrease. And I think we're going to see that proved out in the coming months and quarters as Apple releases their quarterly finance statements after the recent ruling here in the US, their biggest market, that allows stuff like that. I don't think we're going to see a decrease in services revenue, now that they've been forced to open this up. So why not just open it up worldwide and make it easier for everyone and stop hanging the sword of Damocles over everybody that, "Hey, if we win an appeal in a year or two, we're going to revoke this access that you've now gotten at the point of Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers' legal declaration." It's better for the platform. Just make people happy. Make developers happy and users happy and Apple will profit from it. They really will. David Barnard: It does seem like dropping the fee would be a huge change in developer relations, in developer sentiment. I would hope they would go all the way down to 85-15 and I think there's Ben Thompson- John Gruber: And maybe something different for games maybe because- David Barnard: Yeah. That's what I was going to say. Yeah. Maybe games stay at 70-30 because that's what Sony and Nintendo and Steam and everybody else charges. Except for Epic with their App Store, but they obviously have reasons to artificially put that lower. But I can't help but think it would change the tone with the industry more broadly and be more in line with the reality of 2025. Now, you can argue, well, you're not just paying for payment fees. I think that's a disingenuous argument that a lot of people make. It's like, "Oh, Stripe is 3%. Why should we be paying Apple 30% for payments?" Well, you're not paying Apple 30% for payments and this is the argument Apple continues to make is that it's a platform fee. But there's a couple of things in there. One, it's almost a fluke of history that Jobs, in that original iPhone announcement said, "Hey, if you have a free app, we're going to distribute it for free and it doesn't cost you anything." And at the time, that was great and that created companies like Facebook and Uber and others where they might not have been able to make it work. Well, Facebook is a bad example because they were already reasonably profitable, but the iPhone certainly did springboard them even further. John Gruber: Yeah. But I would argue that the company is... It's not just that they adjusted and adapted to mobile. Meta, today, is unrecognizable from the Facebook of 2007. And in hindsight, they were clearly meant for mobile. To the point where they've got products that people use entirely on mobile, right? You can technically use Instagram on the web, but the vast majority of Instagram users have never once used it on the web. David Barnard: But would Instagram exist as it is today if they had to pay 50 cents per download or had to pay per user? John Gruber: Right, right. It is a quirk that Apple... Because Apple was coming at it from the mindset of the way the Mac worked. That there were free apps, but that any company that wanted to run the business from the app would be selling copies of the app. You'd buy the app before you installed it and that was Apple's mindset. And again, they were selling copies of their operating system at the time. If you bought a Mac that had Mac OS 10.2 installed and wanted to upgrade to 10.3, it cost $129 and it cost 100 some dollars or I don't even know what it cost to get Pages and Numbers and Keynote. All of that stuff was for sale for what would, today, strike people as bananas amounts of money and that was their thinking of how software would be sold. And I think the idea of a company and... Meta exemplifies it. That a company, like one of the five biggest companies in the world purely making software... Well, I mean I know they have got the glasses and stuff now too. But like Microsoft, primarily a software company, would be making all their money by giving apps away and only having ads in the app? It just didn't compute at the time and they never foresaw that... It's sort of a loophole. And if it costs them 50 cents a download per user per year, they could afford that very easily. David Barnard: They could. But then, would Instagram have been created? So many companies who have been built on top of it, could they have done it? But in 2025, when you look at the state of the world of Airbnb making billions of dollars, Uber making billions of dollars, Meta making billions of dollars, Google making billions of dollars on the iOS platform and not having to pay a penny other than $100 a year developer account. And here I am, indie developer supporting my family. I've paid Apple over a million dollars. I think closing in on $2 million in my 17-year history. Is that fair? And in the world of 2025, that just seems bananas like, "Why have I paid Apple $2 million for my dinky little indie apps and Meta has paid Apple $100 a year for 17 years?" It's bizarre. If you erase 40 years of history, if you erase all the context that we've built up to this point, and you just look at it as a logical person in 2025, that just seems bananas that I am paying so much to Apple and Meta is paying zero. John Gruber: I do think that was some of the thinking behind the core technology fee for the EU DMA compliance plan where it was sort of like, "What would we do if we did it all over again?" And I think that 50 cents per user per year fee for million plus download apps only was sort of thinking this is what they would do all over again. But the irony of that is that they're even walking away from that now, because the EU has said that the CTF is not compliant with the DMA. So they're switching to a core technology fee or commission which, again, is only on in-app purchases. So again, if you have a super popular app like Instagram that you can use without ever making a digital goods transaction through it, Apple makes nothing but the $100 a year developer fee. I do think they are thinking of it and they tried. The CTF was sort of their attempt but it is sort of a tricky position. But I think the answer to that is, "Hey, maybe you should just be happy that you own this platform and not worry about how much money you make from it," and, again, like that Steve Jobs quote. And just make something else wonderful and go on and really refocus on getting developers to say, "If I didn't have to answer to my boss or what I'm telling my boss and manager, I think we should do is put our efforts into making awesome software for these Apple platforms." To get that developer enthusiasm back I think is worth more to the company than whatever money they're making by breeding pure resentment with the current policy. And I don't want to let it slide, because you mentioned it but I want to emphasize it, that one of those differences between visionOS today and the original Mac in 1984, 1985 at this point based on where we are in visionOS's life, is that even though the Mac wasn't popular in 1985, there was this blossoming ecosystem of Native Mac software, even though the market share wasn't there. Because of the enthusiasm developers had who were like, "Oh my god. People..." It just clicked in their heads like, "This is the computer of the future. I want to make software for it." And we're not seeing that for Vision. We really aren't. There are cool apps and it's not a dead platform but it's nowhere near... visionOS today is nowhere near as vibrant a third party developer ecosystem as the Mac was in 1985 or 1986. And I think that should be the red flag for Apple and I think they might be a little surprised by that. I don't think they're surprised by the number of Vision Pro headsets they've sold, but I think they are a little disappointed and surprised by the lack of developer enthusiasm for the platform. And I think it's entirely because developers are so resentful of the way that Apple has treated them, specifically around finance and payments, that sort of thing. We can argue about the rules on background processing and stuff like that in sandboxing and stuff that apps would like to do. But it's really the resentment... First and foremost, numbers one, two, and three on the list of reasons why developer relations are strained with Apple has to do with money. Anybody who says otherwise is wrong. And Apple doesn't need money. Again, they are not operating on narrow profit margins. Their profit margins have gone up, not down. David Barnard: This is the tricky point though and this is me listening to too much Ben Thompson, but the tricky thing for Apple at this stage though is that the services revenue is so important to the growth narrative around the stock. That even though they don't need the money, they need the money to continue growing the stock at the pace it's growing. And that's the rock and a hard place that they've gotten themselves into is that the services narrative is so strong and that quarter-over-quarter growth in services revenue and services profit when the hardware has kind of started to flatline a little bit- John Gruber: I don't want to interrupt you. But it's like the Exxon Mobil's of the world ran into this problem when they were on top of this market cap lists where it's like, "Well, how many more cars and motorcycles and airplanes consuming fossil fuels could we have, right?" It's like everybody who could have one had one and they're not going to make cars that purposefully consume more fuel. There comes a point where a product or a service or a category really does max out in terms of human population and it's a good place to be. But if your mindset as a Wall Street investor is growth, growth, growth, how much more could they grow, right? David Barnard: Yeah. And maybe this is where we need to go back to this Steve quote from 1997 and maybe the message is as much to Wall Street as it is to developers and Apple saying to Wall Street, "We're going to need to take some lumps, potentially like you and I have said, I mean, if they dropped the fee to 15%, would they lose money? Maybe, but maybe Netflix would come back to the App Store. Maybe... In my job at RevenueCat, I talk to so many developers who are just, "Web, web, web, web, web. We're trying to push as much as we can to the web. We're going to experiment with pushing out of the app into the web now because it's more profitable. We want to save on that 30%." And so, if they drop the fee and it just didn't even make sense to charge on the web. Because at RevenueCat, we did some experiments and Netflix did some experiments with Apple, early in the Epic case, I think it came out that their number was somewhere around that like 12 to 13%. Where if the fee had been dropped that low, it would still be more profitable to operate in the App Store than outside the App Store. And then, there's a lot of complicating factors now too of owning the relationship and would Netflix want Apple to be an intermediary? Well, guess what? If Apple were a more friendly intermediary, maybe they wouldn't mind so much and they would just pick the one that was more profitable on the dollar for dollar basis. John Gruber: We know it's a solvable problem because there are more platforms for signing up customers that give the owner of the service, the newsletter, the streaming service, the music service, whatever it is, more direct relationship with their customers. We've seen them built, so Apple could obviously build one into the App Store. Instead of making all these entitlements over linkouts and stuff like that make it an entitlement where you kind of have to qualify and have these restrictions on, "Well, do you have a customer service department? What's your refund policy? We're going to enforce that you have a customer friendly refund policy where you don't have to call a 1-800 number and listen to somebody try to talk you out of unsubscribing. We're going to test it. That's part of app review, where it has to be as easy to unsubscribe as to subscribe. Otherwise, we will pull your entitlement." But then, if you qualify on those terms and you have those policies in place, you can have more of a direct relationship with your customers. Do whatever it takes to make developers happy to be building for the Apple platforms. Instead, they're clearly focusing on, how can we extract a decent enough portion of the revenue that's conducted on these platforms? David Barnard: Yeah. And so, taking liberties with the Steve Jobs quote from '97, "Apple's going to need to take some lumps in the coming months, but we're going to take it like an adult and I'm proud of that. And the result of that focus, focusing more on developers and building a fantastic platform over extracting as much revenue as we can from that platform, we and third party developers are going to build some really great products where the total is much greater than the sum of the parts." I shitpost on Twitter about Apple all the time and I know a lot of people inside Apple don't like me for some of those posts. But what I care about deeply is this App Store platform- John Gruber: Join the club. David Barnard: Yeah. You recently. It's that you and I care unreasonably about this platform. On an earlier podcast with Ben Thompson, I love this quote from him, he said, "It just breaks my teenage heart to see Apple continuing down this path that it's going on." And I think that you and I both have gotten to this level of frustration with developer relations and what Apple's doing and the way they're operating. Not because we hate Apple and want to see them fail. And not because we're just take joy in ridiculing them or complaining and criticizing them publicly. It's just that we care so deeply and we see the path that they're on and we don't think it's right. And if you take these 40 years of history, you can kind of justify things and you can see how internally they can justify it and see it this way and see it that way. John Gruber: Somehow, they've gotten attached to this income that they've extracted from commissions in the App Store in a way that they've never been attached to other things. I mean, you and I mentioned this during this podcast about the upgrade charge they used to charge for operating systems, $129 to go from Mac OS 10.3 to 10.4. They used to charge $5 to upgrade iOS. They clearly, at that time, were trying to get away from it, but they thought the accounting rules they were trying to follow required them to do it. They've given up on that knowing that it was better for them overall. In theory, you think, "Well, why would you ever... If people were doing it and lining up outside Apple stores to buy boxed versions of the software for $129 to upgrade their existing Mac, why would you ever do away with that if it was so popular that they were lining up?" But in the grand scheme of things, it clearly was the right decision to just make the operating system upgrades free to encourage all users to upgrade and to sort of steer them towards automatic updates, because they can do that because they're not charging. They couldn't do the automatic OS updates that most people, with their default settings on a Mac or iPad or iPhone, just at some point a couple months after the dot O, there's a version they think is stable enough. And overnight, while your phone's charging, you get the new... You're going to have iOS 26 in November or December this year. And they can only do that because they're not charging for it and it's better for them overall. Obviously, they've never made more money, their profits and revenue are at record highs. I think the same thing is true of the commissions in the App Store that, yes, at some level, if you're the CFO at Apple, you're like, "Well, why in the world would we ever decrease this? If we don't legally have to, why would we ever give up a penny of it? It's a lot of money." But it'll all work out in the end in terms of... And Joz himself has mentioned this in multiple of the interviews he did do last month at WWDC. He said the same thing to me and it was an off the record briefing I had with him and it was very cordial and nice. I am sure he won't mind me repeating it because he mentioned it on the record with Joanna Stern and multiple people where one of the things Steve Jobs often said, "If we make great products and tell people about them," that's the marketing part from his perspective, "tell them why they're great, it'll all work out in the end." That's just as true of the App Store as anything else, but it's this one area where they've got a compulsive institutional obsession with squeezing it that they do not need. David Barnard: And speaking of flukes of history, one of the... I think it was an epic case found an email from Schiller to Jobs saying, "What if we cap App Store revenue to Apple at $100 dollars?" Which at the time seemed- John Gruber: No, I think it was a billion. I think it was a billion- David Barnard: Was a billion? Okay. John Gruber: I think it was a billion. David Barnard: Or even a billion. It was like at the point in time when he wrote that, it probably sounded crazy like, "How will we ever make that much money on the App Store?" But then now, in hindsight it's like, "Oh my gosh. That's such a tiny amount to what they're making now." But had Jobs been convinced of that and had they announced publicly, "We're going to cap Apple's revenue on the App Store-" John Gruber: Or even if they never announced it publicly, David Barnard: Right. It became internal policy. John Gruber: Yeah. And that once it hit a billion, they dropped it to 75-25 and it stayed at a billion and it was growing some more and then they could drop it to 80-20. Then eventually, 85-15. Who knows? By now, they'd probably be at 90-10 or 93-7 or something like that. And at certain level then without ever having announced that, they could stop. If it had ever gotten even to 90-10, they could stop and say, "Well, now, we can just sort of let it grow because 10 is pretty fair." And yes, it's not the 2.7% Stripe takes or whatever, but 7% is arguably pretty good deal for everything the App Store offers. David Barnard: And imagine how different the last decade of developer relations would have been had Apple capped it at that. And then, the incentive wasn't for the financial side of things. The incentive was to build a fantastic platform for developers and empower them to serve our customers and keep innovating. John Gruber: And encourage developers and designers and even the companies and managers at those... Who aren't nerds and are into the platform, but just to encourage as much as they can, the mindset of, "Maybe we should build this for Apple platforms exclusively, because of the great APIs and capabilities and... Why even bother with these other platforms? We don't make any money on them. We're doing so great iOS only." They've really gotten away from that. It's to Apple's benefit in obvious ways to have as many developers as possible making Apple platform exclusive software. And at this point, there's such a resentment that to so many people, whether they're managers or executives or developers or just users who are like, "Well, you'd be crazy to build for Apple only because they're sort of against you in terms of trying to just take your money." David Barnard: As a long-term Apple watcher and being friends with so many developers. What do you think it would take? Is a reset even in the cards for Apple at this point? Would it take Phil Schiller on stage at the iPhone 18 whatever- John Gruber: They don't do anything on stage- David Barnard: ... keynote. Well, you're right. But what would it take to get a reset? Above the... I mean- John Gruber: I don't know. David Barnard: ... the money would probably go a long way like, "Okay. We're just going to drop the rate." But it does almost feel like there needs to be some level of that 1997 Jobs' humility of like, "Hey, we made some mistakes. You're going to see a new Apple moving forward." John Gruber: Yeah. But I think you don't have to do it... I don't think it's within Apple to say, "We made some mistakes and we're going to change," even though that's sort of how he addressed. He was willing to say that at WWDC 1997 because what they were scrapping were things that weren't under him, right? OpenDoc and Newton and everything else they scrapped. They weren't Jobs-led post next reunification projects. The Apple way of doing it would be to act like, "We've come up with this amazing new idea that only Apple could do and it's totally innovative and nobody else has ever suggested it before. And it's called taking less money from the App Store," right? And not apologizing and not saying... Presenting it as a new opportunity in the same way that they're pitching the liquid glass of iOS 26 as, "Hey, the capabilities of the hardware and the GPU and the screen display technology with HDR is such that we're able to present this interface that we couldn't have done before." Just present it as the market opportunities and the success of the iPhone are such that we're able to have a new financial set of rules around the App Store that we couldn't have done before, even though they could have. But just say that they couldn't. David Barnard: It's just frustrating on a human level. It's like at work, when I do something stupid or whatever, you apologize. There's just humanity in that level of humility that it is just frustrating to me on a human level. John Gruber: But that would count as an apology, right? It would. Because we'd know. David Barnard: For us as Apple followers, it would. But I think in 2025, the press would have a field day with that and just call BS in a way that I don't know that it would work. And this is kind of something I've been thinking more and more is that Apple needs to do some things on Apple, like to adjust to the realities of 2025 and to set themselves up for the next decade as a platform for developers as a consumer brand and everything else. For example, the small business program was so freaking Apple-like. Instead of just saying, "Hey, 15% for the first million, 30% for everything after," there was all these rules. You got to get into the program and then you get kicked out of the program and they created all these weird... To me, that's just the perfect example of how Apple over does things. And so, to usher in an App Store 3.0, I think we need to see them do things un-Apple-like. And I think that... Again, it's the fanboy in me just wanting to see a new version of Apple. Not that I hate Apple, not that I think they're idiots inside Apple, not that I think anything poor of them as a company, I want to see them succeed. I want to wear Apple glasses, not Meta glasses with a camera on them. And I think there's aspects of what they're building and the trust they've built with consumers and everything else that is setting them up for potentially being that next human computing platform. But having developers on your side and enthusiastic about it is going to be a huge, huge, huge boon. And given how competitive Meta and Google and OpenAI and others are and will be in the coming years, maybe it does require a bit deeper of a reset and doing some things that aren't traditionally how Apple operates. I think even this WWDC was a little bit of a reckoning in that Ben Thompson got it, you got it. Some people got it like, "Hey, this is Apple not overpromising so that they can overdeliver." But the press had a field day with like, "Oh, it's a boring..." They're so far behind on AI and all that kind of stuff. John Gruber: Nobody remembers that though. I mean, it's news for a week and here we are a month out and I think it's already forgotten. And I think Apple should have the fortitude, and the wisdom and you've mentioned at the outset, that their leadership's been there for so long. They remember this, they know how it goes, and they should just be confident in themselves in that way. The other thing about the fact that so many of the senior leaders have been there for so long, it means that most of them are nearing retirement. Schiller has stepped down and is in a different position as an Apple fellow. He still runs events, he still runs the App Store. Tim Cook is... I forget how many. What year? 64 or something like that? Or 63. Eddy Cue and Joz are in their 60s. And I'm not saying any of them are leaving soon. I mean, I'm sure none of them are going to pre-announce their retirements. But in terms of setting things up for the next generation of senior leadership at Apple, which is coming sooner rather than later, right? It's coming over the next decade, across the board, I think that they need to reset the institutional priorities of the company, because the new generation won't have that experience from the '90s that you brought up on this show to explain this. And instead if they took over right now, will just have the mindset of, "Oh, the way Apple works is they expect 30% of all the money on the platform." That's just the way it is and that they don't have any history behind it or why, but that they think that. As opposed to thinking that the most important thing Apple should do is encourage stoke and keep going in an ongoing relationship developer enthusiasm for building exclusive software for our platforms. And making it as great as possible and thinking, "Some of the best software experiences on our platforms are going to come from our third party developers, not from Apple." And that that's the way it should be. And we shouldn't be thinking that all of the best software comes from Apple and it's an afterthought what third parties make. David Barnard: And to your point, I hadn't thought of this until you've brought it up, that in setting things up for the future, I think there is onus on the current executives to not hold on to the past for the next decade when it's then too late. They're in the position, today, and having been at Apple 40 years... But one of the impressive things about Meta these past decade is that as a founder-led company, Zuckerberg put $100 billion into Reality Labs and is force of will and telling shareholders, "Hey, we're making these massive investments and they're going to pay off." And now, he's doing the same with AI, $100 million checks to lure AI talent. That's not something the stock market normally would reward, but he is out there pitching the world that, "Hey, this is an investment worth making and we're going to make it." And I think these Apple executives who've been there 40 years are the best people to say and convince the world, "Hey, we need to make some investments on the developer front and that's going to involve less services revenue," or whatever it has to be. But it's going to pay off in spades in the long run with the innovation that's going to happen with the renewed developer sentiment and everything else. That they're going to need for this next big platform in the coming 5 to 10 years. And it may be too late if they hold on. John Gruber: Well, I agree. David Barnard: Well, I think that's a fantastic place to wrap it up. And really, what I wanted to say on this podcast and hopefully people have gotten that depth of history of when you're frustrated with Apple about this policy or that, there's a lot more going on behind the scenes than... And I mean even, again, as much as I complain on Twitter, I'll acknowledge that I lack a ton of context and I lack a lot of insight. And I'm sure I can understand why people inside Apple are frustrated at the way I frame things sometimes. But when you take all of that history and everything else into account, something needs to change. I'm not sure exactly what that is and me lobbying is me just throwing out ideas. Happy to be wrong about any of this, anything I'm suggesting. But I hope it's helpful to folks to better understand Apple in these ways. John Gruber: If there's one other point that I'll close with, it would be that I mentioned earlier that the problem Apple found itself in the early '90s when Jobs was exiled was this they were caught in this '80s mindset of every couple years, a new platform replaces the old platform and the old platform goes away. When, in fact, the Macintosh was here to stay and they just weren't treating it that way. I'd say Apple's come full circle now and views its platforms as institutions that are there to last decades, including, well, all of the platforms that they have. Including the Mac, which started in 1984. But the iPhone certainly, iPad, even the lesser ones like Watch and tvOS And I think visionOS are things that they intend to last for decades which, at this point, will last well past the careers of the senior leadership at the company. And I think they have that mindset. But I think they're currently doing some things and, again, related to money, just the goddamn money, that are contrary to fostering that. But it's this long-term mindset that the company has that these platforms are institutions and that Apple at a whole is an institution that is meant to be here for a very long time. David Barnard: And if they don't change... Or maybe they don't have to change, I don't even know. John Gruber: But I think if they don't change, then when new things come, they become legacy only. They're not going to disappear. The iPhone is not going anywhere. But the risk to the company is that they become legacy only maybe like Microsoft would be if they hadn't moved to the cloud, right? If Microsoft was still just about Windows and Office and stuff like that, where they would be? They would miss out on the next thing. That their next thing isn't going to hit unless they have developer buy-in. And that you can easily disguise that with the ongoing revenue and profits from those legacy things. In the same way that Microsoft would still be a very big healthy company, even if they hadn't shifted under Satya Nadella, but they wouldn't be number two or number one in the world right now. David Barnard: Yeah. All right. Well, it's been two and a half hours. I think we do need to wrap up but fascinating conversation. Thank you so much for your time, John, and this was- John Gruber: Thanks for having me. David Barnard: Glad to have you. John Gruber: This was fun. David Barnard: I really enjoyed it and I hope it's useful to folks. John Gruber: I won't feel so bad the next time you're on my show for two hours. David Barnard: Thanks so much for listening.

When a company issues a token representing a real-world asset, such as a stock, but it doesn’t have any right to the underlying, “what you’re really doing is taking away from the integrity of investing and moving towards a gambling mindset,” he told Decrypt in a recent interview. “This is the meme-coin-ification of equities,” he added. In 2023, Kaplan testified before lawmakers on Capitol Hill that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had clearly laid out a path to compliance for crypto firms, provoking scrutiny from Republicans and crypto advocates who argued the status quo is unworkable. With tokenization gaining traction under a crypto-friendly SEC following the reelection of U.S. President Donald Trump, Prometheum is trying to reposition itself as a firm specializing in on-chain securities, reprising a familiar tune, but in a slightly different way. “It’s not really a pivot,” Kaplan said. “We've been working with issuers for a long time, and we're very excited for more and more products to come on-chain.” Through a panoply of licenses and subsidiaries, Kaplan said Prometheum can service the “entire lifecycle of a digital asset,” using its transfer agent, alternative trading system, and a special-purpose broker dealer, which also serves as a custodian. Kaplan said Prometheum can currently safeguard a handful of tokens but on-chain securities are coming next. From the beginning, Kaplan said that Prometheum’s goal has been to “to integrate blockchain technology into market infrastructure to just create a better apple cart,” following the same rules but “eliminating the drag that occurs from legacy systems.” The vision parallels BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who predicted tokenization would become the “next generation of markets” by making markets more efficient in 2022. Citadel Securities, one of the world’s largest market makers, urged the SEC in a letter earlier this week to treat tokenized equities in a similar manner to traditional counterparts. “Simply put, while we strongly support technological innovations designed to address market inefficiencies, seeking to exploit regulatory arbitrage for ‘look-a-like’ securities is not innovation,” it argued, calling on the SEC to “resist self-serving requests for broad exemptions.” In a statement weeks ago, SEC Commissioner and crypto task force boss Hester Peirce told firms structuring tokenized offerings to consider meeting with the regulator, noting that tokenization does not provide an exemption from existing rules and regulations. In recent months, crypto exchange Kraken has backed xStocks on Solana, while trading platform Robinhood has introduced “stocks tokens” on the Ethereum scaling network Arbitrum. Robinhood clarified, following criticism from OpenAI, that its tokens represent contracts, and in the case of the ChatGPT maker, they give “indirect exposure to public markets.” Earlier this month, Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo argued to Decrypt that the only true form of tokenization is “native,” meaning the asset itself is issued on-chain, as opposed to representing an asset that’s held, managed, and recorded somewhere else. Kaplan agrees, but he thinks not all companies are getting the compliance element. “I think people have started to view tokenization as an alternative to regulation,” he said. “It might be a derivative, but it's a security, and therefore it still has to follow the rules.” CORRECTION (JULY 23, 2025, 4:40 p.m.): Fixes title in headline to Co-CEO.

Editor Crypto Bitcoin Magazine, Oscar Zarraga Perez The executive order, expected this week, aims to unlock the $9 trillion retirement market by allowing 401(k) plans to invest in alternative assets. Financial Times reported today that President Trump is preparing to sign an executive order that would allow 401(k) retirement plans to invest in alternative assets such as gold, private equity, and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. “Donald Trump is preparing to open the $9tn US retirement market to cryptocurrency investments, gold, and private equity in a move that would spur a radical shift in the way Americans’ savings are managed,” reported the Financial Times. According to Financial Times, the order is expected this week and will direct federal regulators to remove barriers preventing 401(k) plans from including these non-traditional investments in managed funds. This includes digital assets, metals, private loans, infrastructure deals, and corporate buyout funds. “President Trump is committed to restoring prosperity for everyday Americans and safeguarding their economic future,” said the White House in a statement to the Financial Times. “No decisions should be deemed official, however, unless they come from President Trump himself.” Trump’s move builds on his administration’s earlier efforts to ease bitcoin and crypto regulations. In May, the Department of Labor reversed a rule that discouraged bitcoin and other crypto in retirement plans. Trump has also supported recent bitcoin and other crypto related bills passed by the House and credited the industry with helping him win the 2024 election. The executive order could benefit major private investment firms such as Blackstone, Apollo, and BlackRock, reported the Financial Times, which have all pinned much of their future growth on investing money on behalf of retirement savers. “Blackstone has struck a partnership with Vanguard, while Apollo and Partners Group are among firms that will offer investments to Empower, a large 401k plan sponsor. BlackRock has already begun working with Great Gray Trust, a third-party manger of retirement savings plans,” stated Financial Times.

Title: Rocket Lab Stock Is Up 800% In A Year. Is Now The Time To Buy?

Time Published: 2025-07-23T18:34:07Z
Full Content:
BySasirekha Subramanian BySasirekha Subramanian, Contributor. A lot hinges on Rocket Lab’s ability to evolve its revenue model and reach sustained profitability. Rocket Lab stock is in the stratosphere — skyrocketing 800% over the past year, propelled by a potent mix of explosive launch cadence, major contract wins and mounting anticipation around its upcoming Neutron rocket. Beyond fundamental strength, broader investor rotation into tariff-insulated aerospace names, and SpaceX-related political headwinds have turbocharged the rally. With sentiment now sky-high, the real question is: Can Rocket Lab keep climbing? Let’s break down the key drivers, risks and whether it’s still a buy. Rocket Lab has been feeding off investor excitement around the burgeoning space economy. Beyond offering reliable launch services for small satellites — significant in itself — Rocket Lab is deepening its moat by building an end-to-end space infrastructure platform. With its Electron rocket for small satellite launches, spacecraft platform, satellite components and on-orbit management solutions, Rocket Lab is targeting the full spectrum of the space value chain. This integrated approach strengthens its appeal for procuring large scale government and commercial contracts. Rocket Lab operates through two core segments: launch services and space systems. For the recent first quarter of 2025, space systems represented $87 million, or 70% of revenues, while launch services $35.6 million or 30%. Rocket Lab’s revenue has grown at a stellar pace of 7x, from $62.2 million in 2021 to $436.2 million in 2024, and is estimated to grow to $573.3 million in 2025, representing 31% year-on-year growth. The company is not yet profitable and cash flows are negative. Cash and equivalents at the end of Q1 2025 was $517 million. Backlog as of Q1 2025 was $1.067 billion with 60% attributed to the space systems segment and 40% to launch services. Commercial customers represented 54% of the backlog, while Government customers represented 46%. Rocket Lab expects about 56% of this backlog to be recognized within 12 months. Rocket Lab’s 800% stock surge reflects a blend of recent execution and future potential. Neutron is the main narrative investors are buying into now, even if Rocket Lab’s current fundamentals are still tied to Electron. At the heart of Rocket Lab’s next growth chapter is Neutron, its upcoming next-gen satellite launch vehicle that is central to its shift from small satellite missions to heavier payloads and high-value national security contracts. Neutron builds on the success of Electron, which has logged 3x more successful launches than all other American small launch providers combined over the past decade. If successful, Neutron could emerge as the first credible challenger to SpaceX’s Falcon 9 in the medium-lift launch market, breaking into a near-monopoly space and significantly expanding Rocket Lab’s total addressable market. Investors already have a reason to be optimistic: The U.S. Space Force selected Rocket Lab to compete for high-priority, national security missions under its $5.6 billion National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program. Rocket Lab’s launch vehicle for this program will be Neutron. Meanwhile, Electron, which is the second most frequently launched U.S. rocket, remains Rocket Lab’s workhorse. The company successfully launched its 68th Electron rocket (as of June 28) and also set a new launch turnaround record, with the mission being the second of two launches from the same launch site in less than 48 hours. In the first quarter of 2025, Electron achieved a 100% mission success rate, including an impressive, rapid turnaround of three launches in 13 days. This operational excellence continues to win trust and contracts for Electron missions. Rocket Lab sees commercial and government demand for 20+ Electron launches in 2025. Rocket Lab’s hypersonic test vehicle — HASTE (Hypersonic Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron) is seeing strong demand in the U.S., and beginning to gain traction internationally. Regular hypersonic flight tests are vital to advancing a nation’s defense capabilities, and HASTE is playing a central role. Both The U.S and The United Kingdom have picked HASTE to develop sovereign hypersonic technology for their multibillion dollar defense programs. Rocket Lab is also a key subcontractor under Kratos Defense’s flagship DoD program MACH‑TB 2.0, a $1.45 billion, five-year project to boost the U.S.’s hypersonic testing capabilities. With the latest launch award, Rocket Lab has now secured a total of seven HASTE missions for MACH-TB, underscoring its reliable launch cadence. Critically, Rocket Lab’s U.S.-based, non-China-linked ecosystem is a major asset in an era where national security, tech sovereignty and supply-chain resilience are top priorities. Although there is remarkable progress in the U.S.-China relations, geopolitical setups are never fully reliable and remain a wildcard. So, it is reassuring for investors to know that Rocket Lab is well aligned with Western defense and aerospace priorities. The company sees its current backlog for Electron and HASTE to support a higher average selling price for missions for through 2025 vs. 2024, powering continued gross margin expansion. Non GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 33.4%, above its guidance of 30% to 32%, and is seen expanding to 34% to 36% for the second quarter. On June 30, 2025, Rocket Lab joined the Russell 1000 Growth Index, prompting a wave of passive fund rebalancing worth $200 billion as index-tracking ETFs snapped up RKLB shares. The stock is up 30% from its June 30, closing price of $35.77. Whether Rocket Lab stock will continue to rise, hinges on a successful Neutron launch, and seamless execution of its end-to-end space platform strategy. So far, everything seems to be going right with Neutron. Neutron’s inclusion in the Pentagon’s $5.6 billion National Security Space Launch program is a validation of its strategic alignment with U.S. defense and space priorities, and a potential springboard into high-value defense missions. Neutron is being designed for reuse and frequent launches, which is a critical advancement in space tech that the Department of Defense (DOD) appears highly supportive of. As an endorsement for Neutron’s return-to-Earth capabilities, the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) has selected Neutron for a mission that supports its broader initiative to explore point-to-point cargo transportation using commercial launch vehicles. The mission will focus on returning payloads to Earth, and is scheduled to fly no earlier than 2026. Rocket Lab has signed a multi-launch agreement with an unnamed commercial satellite constellation operator, under which it will launch two dedicated missions on Neutron starting from mid-2026. The deal marks the start of what could become a larger collaboration, with Neutron likely to play a central role in launching the full constellation. All this interest in Neutron from Government and private customers, while it is still in the pre-launch phase - ups the ante significantly. Neutron has successfully completed its second stage qualification campaign — a major milestone that validates its design, operations and launch readiness for later this year. Rocket Lab said it conducted launch-like operations across the full stack, including flight software, hardware, avionics, and guidance, navigation and control systems. The stage was also proof-tested to more than 25% of its design load, including applying more than 1.3 million pounds of force and tension across the carbon composite structure. Neutron’s Stage 2 is a novel design compared to traditional rockets. Instead of being supported from the bottom, Stage 2 is suspended from the top of Stage 1’s tank, enabling a very lightweight structure. Retiring the risk associated with this novel configuration early on was a strategic priority. Stage 2’s structural design closely mirrors that of Stage 1, so this successful test campaign also helped de-risk critical elements of the first stage. Per Rocket Lab’s earnings call in May, Neutron Stage 2 is now going through final assembly and will be shipped to the launch site in the next few months in preparation for stage testing with the engine. Neutron’s Stage 1 upper module is also nearing completion. It integrates some of the most complex mechanical systems on the rocket, all of which are expected to perform seamlessly in testing. While most of Neutron is assembled at Rocket Lab’s facilities, the vehicle is shipped in segments to the Launch Complex 3 in Virginia, where it is integrated as a full rocket. The good news is construction at Launch Complex 3 is on schedule and nearing completion. The challenge is the launch site — the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) on Wallops Island, Virginia — has limited maritime infrastructure, and access through the shallow Sloop Gut channel is possible only during favorable tides. Rocket Lab is exploring a workaround with plans for dredging the channel so barges can deliver the segments more reliably. And yes, Rocket Lab still expects to launch Neutron in the second half of this year. Rocket Lab’s plan to build an end-to-end space company is key to its ability to win large-value contracts, so it is imperative that the plans succeed. A key part of this strategy is its pending acquisition of Mynaric, a German company specializing in laser-based satellite communication systems. The deal expands Rocket Lab’s footprint into Europe, and provides access to European programs and growth opportunities. The acquisition is a natural fit: Mynaric already supplies CONDOR Mk3 optical communication terminals to Rocket Lab under its $515 million Space Development Agency (SDA) contract to produce 18 satellites for the Tranche 2 Transport Layer-Beta. Mynaric is also involved in other SDA contracts and shares many clients with Rocket Lab spanning commercial constellation operators, prime contractors and defense and civil government agencies. Rocket Lab plans to scale production and improve efficiencies within Mynaric’s manufacturing process, bolstering its ability to deliver optical terminals on time and on budget. The move should position Rocket Lab to support a broader range of future SDA and defense initiatives. On the spacecraft side, Rocket Lab’s Pioneer spacecraft has already launched three missions for Varda Space Industries, supporting in-space pharmaceutical manufacturing and rapid reentry operations. The third mission for Varda was launched within 15 days after the successful return of Varda’s second mission, demonstrating Rocket Lab’s ability to maintain high-cadence launch and reentry space missions. Meanwhile, integration and testing for a fourth and final Pioneer spacecraft is in the works. New product launches like STARRAY, a plug and play, low-cost line of modular solar arrays to meet the power needs of satellites operating in any orbital conditions, are gaining traction with customers. Rocket Lab has also expanded its suite of Frontier satellite radios that are compatible with the industry’s most important global ground stations. The company has also launched the next generation versions of its popular MAX software packages for satellite guidance and control. Rocket Lab’s MAX software supported the successful Moon landing of Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost Mission 1 earlier this year. The MAX software suite is also utilized in both NASA's CAPSTONE mission and DARPA's Blackjack program, as well as in Rocket Lab’s own Pioneer spacecraft for its Varda missions. So, the vertical integration plan appears to be proceeding smoothly. As Rocket Lab gears up to compete on a larger scale, comparisons with industry giant SpaceX are inevitable. SpaceX claims that it represents approximately 80% of the payload mass launched in orbit. Rocket Lab, by contrast, has focused on launching smaller satellites and payloads, but is aiming to facilitate bigger payloads with Neutron. Neutron will be a few tons below the payload capacity of Space X’s Falcon 9, but a Neutron launch is estimated to cost customers an estimated $50-55 million compared to the $67 million price tag for a Falcon 9 launch. On a per-kilogram basis, the cost is more-or-less the same for both. The company expects Neutron launch margins of approximately 50%, with the cost per Neutron launch estimated between $20 million and $25 million. Rocket Lab anticipates flying each reusable Neutron booster 10 to 20 times, comparable with the reuse cadence of a Falcon 9 booster. For long-term, growth-oriented investors, Rocket Lab offers strong upside, subject to achieving key milestones. Some catalysts include: Steep valuation vs. opportunity: Bloomberg recently reported that SpaceX is preparing for an insider share sale that would value the company at around $400 billion, which is nearly 20x bigger than Rocket Lab’s $22.5 billion market cap. Even with a modest narrowing of this enormous valuation gap, the potential upside for Rocket Lab stock could be substantial. Neutron could unlock a larger total addressable market: If Neutron succeeds in the medium lift segment, Rocket Lab could unlock a sizable, multi-billion total addressable market over the next decade, paving the path to profitability and leaving room for further stock upside. Minimal tariff exposure: Rocket Lab’s Electron rockets are made in New Zealand and launched from there. Very few of its Electron launches happen outside of New Zealand. So, the tariff exposure is minimal in its Electron launch business. Rocket Lab’s Space Systems business is intensively domestically sourced. Most manufacturing happens in the U.S., and what is not manufactured in the U.S. still entails high U.S. involvement. Rocket Lab has its manufacturing intensity largely aligned to geographies with minimal tariff exposure. This factor is also key to procuring defense contracts ruled by national security concerns. Increasing launch cadence, a clear path to government-aligned revenue streams, a bold yet calculated bet on the Neutron rocket, strategic vertical integration and a growing backlog give Rocket Lab a foundation that many other space stocks still lack. This suggests that RKLB’s 800% rally over the past year is not merely rooted in hype. That said, the stock’s current valuation, with much of the investor optimism already priced in, leaves little room for missteps. A lot hinges on Rocket Lab’s ability to evolve its revenue model and reach sustained profitability. At current levels, the stock has already hit the upper range of analyst price targets, making it more of a Hold than a Buy for now.

BySasirekha Subramanian BySasirekha Subramanian, Contributor. A lot hinges on Rocket Lab’s ability to evolve its revenue model and reach sustained profitability. Rocket Lab stock is in the stratosphere — skyrocketing 800% over the past year, propelled by a potent mix of explosive launch cadence, major contract wins and mounting anticipation around its upcoming Neutron rocket. Beyond fundamental strength, broader investor rotation into tariff-insulated aerospace names, and SpaceX-related political headwinds have turbocharged the rally. With sentiment now sky-high, the real question is: Can Rocket Lab keep climbing? Let’s break down the key drivers, risks and whether it’s still a buy. Rocket Lab has been feeding off investor excitement around the burgeoning space economy. Beyond offering reliable launch services for small satellites — significant in itself — Rocket Lab is deepening its moat by building an end-to-end space infrastructure platform. With its Electron rocket for small satellite launches, spacecraft platform, satellite components and on-orbit management solutions, Rocket Lab is targeting the full spectrum of the space value chain. This integrated approach strengthens its appeal for procuring large scale government and commercial contracts. Rocket Lab operates through two core segments: launch services and space systems. For the recent first quarter of 2025, space systems represented $87 million, or 70% of revenues, while launch services $35.6 million or 30%. Rocket Lab’s revenue has grown at a stellar pace of 7x, from $62.2 million in 2021 to $436.2 million in 2024, and is estimated to grow to $573.3 million in 2025, representing 31% year-on-year growth. The company is not yet profitable and cash flows are negative. Cash and equivalents at the end of Q1 2025 was $517 million. Backlog as of Q1 2025 was $1.067 billion with 60% attributed to the space systems segment and 40% to launch services. Commercial customers represented 54% of the backlog, while Government customers represented 46%. Rocket Lab expects about 56% of this backlog to be recognized within 12 months. Rocket Lab’s 800% stock surge reflects a blend of recent execution and future potential. Neutron is the main narrative investors are buying into now, even if Rocket Lab’s current fundamentals are still tied to Electron. At the heart of Rocket Lab’s next growth chapter is Neutron, its upcoming next-gen satellite launch vehicle that is central to its shift from small satellite missions to heavier payloads and high-value national security contracts. Neutron builds on the success of Electron, which has logged 3x more successful launches than all other American small launch providers combined over the past decade. If successful, Neutron could emerge as the first credible challenger to SpaceX’s Falcon 9 in the medium-lift launch market, breaking into a near-monopoly space and significantly expanding Rocket Lab’s total addressable market. Investors already have a reason to be optimistic: The U.S. Space Force selected Rocket Lab to compete for high-priority, national security missions under its $5.6 billion National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program. Rocket Lab’s launch vehicle for this program will be Neutron. Meanwhile, Electron, which is the second most frequently launched U.S. rocket, remains Rocket Lab’s workhorse. The company successfully launched its 68th Electron rocket (as of June 28) and also set a new launch turnaround record, with the mission being the second of two launches from the same launch site in less than 48 hours. In the first quarter of 2025, Electron achieved a 100% mission success rate, including an impressive, rapid turnaround of three launches in 13 days. This operational excellence continues to win trust and contracts for Electron missions. Rocket Lab sees commercial and government demand for 20+ Electron launches in 2025. Rocket Lab’s hypersonic test vehicle — HASTE (Hypersonic Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron) is seeing strong demand in the U.S., and beginning to gain traction internationally. Regular hypersonic flight tests are vital to advancing a nation’s defense capabilities, and HASTE is playing a central role. Both The U.S and The United Kingdom have picked HASTE to develop sovereign hypersonic technology for their multibillion dollar defense programs. Rocket Lab is also a key subcontractor under Kratos Defense’s flagship DoD program MACH‑TB 2.0, a $1.45 billion, five-year project to boost the U.S.’s hypersonic testing capabilities. With the latest launch award, Rocket Lab has now secured a total of seven HASTE missions for MACH-TB, underscoring its reliable launch cadence. Critically, Rocket Lab’s U.S.-based, non-China-linked ecosystem is a major asset in an era where national security, tech sovereignty and supply-chain resilience are top priorities. Although there is remarkable progress in the U.S.-China relations, geopolitical setups are never fully reliable and remain a wildcard. So, it is reassuring for investors to know that Rocket Lab is well aligned with Western defense and aerospace priorities. The company sees its current backlog for Electron and HASTE to support a higher average selling price for missions for through 2025 vs. 2024, powering continued gross margin expansion. Non GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 33.4%, above its guidance of 30% to 32%, and is seen expanding to 34% to 36% for the second quarter. On June 30, 2025, Rocket Lab joined the Russell 1000 Growth Index, prompting a wave of passive fund rebalancing worth $200 billion as index-tracking ETFs snapped up RKLB shares. The stock is up 30% from its June 30, closing price of $35.77. Whether Rocket Lab stock will continue to rise, hinges on a successful Neutron launch, and seamless execution of its end-to-end space platform strategy. So far, everything seems to be going right with Neutron. Neutron’s inclusion in the Pentagon’s $5.6 billion National Security Space Launch program is a validation of its strategic alignment with U.S. defense and space priorities, and a potential springboard into high-value defense missions. Neutron is being designed for reuse and frequent launches, which is a critical advancement in space tech that the Department of Defense (DOD) appears highly supportive of. As an endorsement for Neutron’s return-to-Earth capabilities, the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) has selected Neutron for a mission that supports its broader initiative to explore point-to-point cargo transportation using commercial launch vehicles. The mission will focus on returning payloads to Earth, and is scheduled to fly no earlier than 2026. Rocket Lab has signed a multi-launch agreement with an unnamed commercial satellite constellation operator, under which it will launch two dedicated missions on Neutron starting from mid-2026. The deal marks the start of what could become a larger collaboration, with Neutron likely to play a central role in launching the full constellation. All this interest in Neutron from Government and private customers, while it is still in the pre-launch phase - ups the ante significantly. Neutron has successfully completed its second stage qualification campaign — a major milestone that validates its design, operations and launch readiness for later this year. Rocket Lab said it conducted launch-like operations across the full stack, including flight software, hardware, avionics, and guidance, navigation and control systems. The stage was also proof-tested to more than 25% of its design load, including applying more than 1.3 million pounds of force and tension across the carbon composite structure. Neutron’s Stage 2 is a novel design compared to traditional rockets. Instead of being supported from the bottom, Stage 2 is suspended from the top of Stage 1’s tank, enabling a very lightweight structure. Retiring the risk associated with this novel configuration early on was a strategic priority. Stage 2’s structural design closely mirrors that of Stage 1, so this successful test campaign also helped de-risk critical elements of the first stage. Per Rocket Lab’s earnings call in May, Neutron Stage 2 is now going through final assembly and will be shipped to the launch site in the next few months in preparation for stage testing with the engine. Neutron’s Stage 1 upper module is also nearing completion. It integrates some of the most complex mechanical systems on the rocket, all of which are expected to perform seamlessly in testing. While most of Neutron is assembled at Rocket Lab’s facilities, the vehicle is shipped in segments to the Launch Complex 3 in Virginia, where it is integrated as a full rocket. The good news is construction at Launch Complex 3 is on schedule and nearing completion. The challenge is the launch site — the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) on Wallops Island, Virginia — has limited maritime infrastructure, and access through the shallow Sloop Gut channel is possible only during favorable tides. Rocket Lab is exploring a workaround with plans for dredging the channel so barges can deliver the segments more reliably. And yes, Rocket Lab still expects to launch Neutron in the second half of this year. Rocket Lab’s plan to build an end-to-end space company is key to its ability to win large-value contracts, so it is imperative that the plans succeed. A key part of this strategy is its pending acquisition of Mynaric, a German company specializing in laser-based satellite communication systems. The deal expands Rocket Lab’s footprint into Europe, and provides access to European programs and growth opportunities. The acquisition is a natural fit: Mynaric already supplies CONDOR Mk3 optical communication terminals to Rocket Lab under its $515 million Space Development Agency (SDA) contract to produce 18 satellites for the Tranche 2 Transport Layer-Beta. Mynaric is also involved in other SDA contracts and shares many clients with Rocket Lab spanning commercial constellation operators, prime contractors and defense and civil government agencies. Rocket Lab plans to scale production and improve efficiencies within Mynaric’s manufacturing process, bolstering its ability to deliver optical terminals on time and on budget. The move should position Rocket Lab to support a broader range of future SDA and defense initiatives. On the spacecraft side, Rocket Lab’s Pioneer spacecraft has already launched three missions for Varda Space Industries, supporting in-space pharmaceutical manufacturing and rapid reentry operations. The third mission for Varda was launched within 15 days after the successful return of Varda’s second mission, demonstrating Rocket Lab’s ability to maintain high-cadence launch and reentry space missions. Meanwhile, integration and testing for a fourth and final Pioneer spacecraft is in the works. New product launches like STARRAY, a plug and play, low-cost line of modular solar arrays to meet the power needs of satellites operating in any orbital conditions, are gaining traction with customers. Rocket Lab has also expanded its suite of Frontier satellite radios that are compatible with the industry’s most important global ground stations. The company has also launched the next generation versions of its popular MAX software packages for satellite guidance and control. Rocket Lab’s MAX software supported the successful Moon landing of Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost Mission 1 earlier this year. The MAX software suite is also utilized in both NASA's CAPSTONE mission and DARPA's Blackjack program, as well as in Rocket Lab’s own Pioneer spacecraft for its Varda missions. So, the vertical integration plan appears to be proceeding smoothly. As Rocket Lab gears up to compete on a larger scale, comparisons with industry giant SpaceX are inevitable. SpaceX claims that it represents approximately 80% of the payload mass launched in orbit. Rocket Lab, by contrast, has focused on launching smaller satellites and payloads, but is aiming to facilitate bigger payloads with Neutron. Neutron will be a few tons below the payload capacity of Space X’s Falcon 9, but a Neutron launch is estimated to cost customers an estimated $50-55 million compared to the $67 million price tag for a Falcon 9 launch. On a per-kilogram basis, the cost is more-or-less the same for both. The company expects Neutron launch margins of approximately 50%, with the cost per Neutron launch estimated between $20 million and $25 million. Rocket Lab anticipates flying each reusable Neutron booster 10 to 20 times, comparable with the reuse cadence of a Falcon 9 booster. For long-term, growth-oriented investors, Rocket Lab offers strong upside, subject to achieving key milestones. Some catalysts include: Steep valuation vs. opportunity: Bloomberg recently reported that SpaceX is preparing for an insider share sale that would value the company at around $400 billion, which is nearly 20x bigger than Rocket Lab’s $22.5 billion market cap. Even with a modest narrowing of this enormous valuation gap, the potential upside for Rocket Lab stock could be substantial. Neutron could unlock a larger total addressable market: If Neutron succeeds in the medium lift segment, Rocket Lab could unlock a sizable, multi-billion total addressable market over the next decade, paving the path to profitability and leaving room for further stock upside. Minimal tariff exposure: Rocket Lab’s Electron rockets are made in New Zealand and launched from there. Very few of its Electron launches happen outside of New Zealand. So, the tariff exposure is minimal in its Electron launch business. Rocket Lab’s Space Systems business is intensively domestically sourced. Most manufacturing happens in the U.S., and what is not manufactured in the U.S. still entails high U.S. involvement. Rocket Lab has its manufacturing intensity largely aligned to geographies with minimal tariff exposure. This factor is also key to procuring defense contracts ruled by national security concerns. Increasing launch cadence, a clear path to government-aligned revenue streams, a bold yet calculated bet on the Neutron rocket, strategic vertical integration and a growing backlog give Rocket Lab a foundation that many other space stocks still lack.

Title: AFL-CIO Executive Paywatch: CEOs of America’s largest public companies made 285 times more than workers last year

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Starbucks’ coffee isn’t the only thing at the company that’s amped up. Its CEO, Brian Niccol, made a whopping 6,666 times more than the company’s typical employee last year, according to the AFL-CIO’s annual Executive Paywatch report, released Wednesday. It was the widest pay gap by far between the top executive and median worker among the nation’s 500 largest public companies listed in the report. Niccol, who took over the company’s helm last September, received nearly $98 million in compensation, compared to the typical Starbucks worker’s pay of less than $15,000, according to the report, which drew from corporate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Starbucks is but one example of the hefty pay gap between America’s corporate leaders and their workers, which grew even larger in 2024. CEOs at the largest public companies took home $18.9 million last year, or 285 times as much as the typical US worker’s paycheck of $49,500. That’s up from a ratio of 268 to 1 a year earlier, according to the AFL-CIO, a powerful federation of labor unions representing 15 million workers. The typical employee would have had to start working in 1740 to earn what the average CEO received in 2024, the report noted. CEO pay at S&P 500 companies increased 7% in 2024 from the prior year. It topped the prior peak of $18.3 million in 2021, though the ratio was 324 to 1 that year. The typical private sector worker’s raise last year was 3%, the AFL-CIO said, citing Bureau of Labor Statistics data. At Starbucks, the typical worker is a part-time barista in the US, the company said in its SEC filing. It noted that many of its employees work in part-time, flexible positions, which has the effect of lowering the compensation level of its median employee. Also, the calculation includes its global workforce of about 361,000 staffers, not just the roughly 210,000 US-based workers. Some staffers at the coffee retailer have formed a union, Starbucks Workers United, and have staged strikes at various locations in recent years. Among their demands is a wage increase. It’s “no wonder why the workers there at Starbucks are fighting to form a union with the Starbucks Workers Union to improve their pay and working conditions,” Fred Redmond, AFL-CIO’s secretary-treasurer, told reporters. “And these numbers only begin to scratch the surface of how runaway executive pay is fueling economic inequality.” Starbucks did not immediately return a request for comment. In its report this year, the AFL-CIO highlighted that the sweeping tax and spending cuts package that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4 will provide CEOs with far bigger tax breaks than workers. The average CEO will receive a tax cut of nearly $490,000 from the permanent extension of the lower individual income tax rates, which were initially reduced in Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the report found. That compares to a $765 tax break for the typical US worker. Unlike workers, salaries are not the largest component of CEOs’ compensation. Nearly half of the top executives’ total pay was restricted stock awards, and another $4 million were bonuses. The highest-paid CEO of an S&P 500 company was Patrick Smith of Axon Enterprise, which manufactures Tasers and other weapons for law enforcement and the military. He received a package of nearly $165 million. Most stock quote data provided by BATS. US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

Title: Is It Too Late To Buy MicroStrategy Stock Now After Soaring Over 100% In A Year?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/is-it-too-late-buy-microstrategy-mstr-stock/
Time Published: 2025-07-23T18:30:37Z

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. Rather than timing the market, focus on whether MicroStrategy's leveraged bitcoin strategy aligns ... More with your investment goals and risk capacity. MicroStrategy (MSTR) has become one of the most polarizing stocks on Wall Street, delivering explosive returns that have left investors wondering whether they've missed the boat. With gains ranging from 58% to 176% over the past year, depending on the measurement period, and year-to-date performance soaring between 140-143%, the company's transformation from a traditional business intelligence firm into what Executive Chairman Michael Saylor calls a "Bitcoin Treasury Company" has created unprecedented volatility and opportunity. The question facing investors today isn't whether MicroStrategy has been successful – the numbers speak for themselves. Instead, the question is whether the stock's meteoric rise has created an unsustainable bubble or if there's still room for growth. With shares trading at $435.60 and a market capitalization approaching $122 billion, MicroStrategy now commands a valuation that dwarfs many established tech giants, making this decision all the more critical for potential investors. MicroStrategy's extraordinary performance is directly attributed to its bold bet on bitcoin, which has fundamentally altered the company's risk-return profile. The company now holds approximately 592,000 bitcoin worth roughly $70 billion, making it a leveraged play on cryptocurrency rather than a traditional software business. This massive bitcoin treasury has created a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.93 with bitcoin returns, meaning the stock moves almost in lockstep with the world's largest cryptocurrency. The stock's recent surge has been amplified by MicroStrategy's aggressive acquisition strategy, including a July 2025 purchase of 4,225 additional bitcoin that brought total holdings above 600,000 coins. Each bitcoin purchase serves as a catalyst, often triggering immediate stock price reactions from investors who view these moves as validation of the company's strategy and a sign of confidence in bitcoin's long-term prospects. Today's MicroStrategy operates as a hybrid entity that straddles two vastly different business models. While the company still maintains its original business intelligence and analytics software operations, these traditional revenue streams have been overshadowed by the massive bitcoin holdings that now define the company's value proposition. The original software business continues generating revenue, but investors largely ignore these fundamentals in favor of bitcoin exposure. The company's financial structure reflects this transformation, with a beta of approximately 3.7 indicating extreme volatility compared to the broader market. MicroStrategy has funded its bitcoin acquisitions through a combination of debt financing and equity issuance, with outstanding shares increasing 42% year-over-year to roughly 279 million. This aggressive capital-raising approach has enabled continued bitcoin accumulation but has also introduced significant dilution risk for existing shareholders. Determining MicroStrategy's fair value has become increasingly complex as traditional valuation metrics have become less reliable. The company trades at a significant premium to the net asset value of its bitcoin holdings, with a $122 billion market cap exceeding the $70 billion value of its cryptocurrency treasury by a substantial margin. Critics argue that this premium creates a dangerous bubble, particularly considering the company's lack of profitability, with earnings per share ranging from a negative $22.22 to negative $25. The valuation challenge is compounded by MicroStrategy's transformation into what's essentially a bitcoin investment vehicle with software revenue on the side. Investors are paying not just for bitcoin exposure but for Michael Saylor's ability to continue acquiring cryptocurrency through creative financing structures. Whether this premium is justified depends primarily on one's view of bitcoin's future trajectory and MicroStrategy's ability to execute effectively in leveraging traditional capital markets for cryptocurrency accumulation. Wall Street analysts remain divided on MicroStrategy's prospects, reflecting the broader uncertainty surrounding both the company's unique business model and the future of bitcoin. The stock's extreme volatility and unconventional structure make it challenging for traditional equity analysts to apply standard valuation frameworks. Many analysts focus more on bitcoin price targets and MicroStrategy's ability to continue its accumulation strategy rather than conventional metrics, such as revenue growth or profit margins. The upcoming July 31, 2025, earnings announcement, after the market close, represents a key catalyst that could provide clarity on the company's financial health and future bitcoin acquisition plans. Recent moves, including the issuance of $1 billion in preferred shares with 10% annual non-cumulative dividends, have been viewed as accretive by some analysts, who see it as a creative way to fund further bitcoin purchases while providing yield to income-focused investors. Supporters argue that MicroStrategy remains undervalued relative to its long-term potential, particularly if bitcoin continues its adoption trajectory among institutional investors and potentially governments. The company's first-mover advantage in corporate bitcoin adoption has created a unique position that would be difficult for competitors to replicate, especially given the regulatory uncertainties and board-level resistance typically found at most traditional corporations. The bull case also emphasizes MicroStrategy's innovative financing strategies, which have allowed the company to accumulate bitcoin without selling existing holdings. The recent preferred shares offering demonstrates management's creativity in accessing capital markets, potentially providing a sustainable model for continued accumulation. Technical indicators support this optimism, with the stock trading above all major moving averages and an RSI of approximately 58 suggesting room for further gains. Furthermore, MicroStrategy's massive bitcoin treasury creates inherent optionality value. As bitcoin gains wider acceptance or regulatory clarity improves, the company's holdings could benefit from multiple expansion beyond just cryptocurrency price appreciation. The leverage inherent in the stock structure means that modest gains in bitcoin translate into amplified returns for equity holders. The bear case centers on valuation concerns and the inherent risks associated with MicroStrategy's leverage-heavy strategy. Trading at a significant premium to its net bitcoin value while generating losses from operations suggests that the market has already priced in optimistic bitcoin scenarios. The company's 3.7 beta indicates that any bitcoin downturn will be magnified, potentially resulting in devastating losses for shareholders who purchase at current elevated levels. The bear case isn’t just about valuation or leverage—it’s about bubble risk. MicroStrategy trades at a substantial premium to its bitcoin holdings, reflecting aggressive bullish expectations that assume the crypto market continues to surge. However, the core argument against Bitcoin—that it’s a speculative bubble—has been raised by many, including Nobel laureates such as Robert Shiller, Joseph Stiglitz, Paul Krugman, and others. Even a moderate 20% drop in bitcoin could wipe out billions and trigger margin calls, magnified by MSTR’s 3.7 beta, making losses far steeper. And as the bitcoin bubble bursts, MSTR’s share count may continue rising—its 42% YoY dilution could erode any remaining equity value. Structural concerns about dilution present another significant risk factor. The company's reliance on equity and debt issuance to fund bitcoin purchases means existing shareholders face continuous dilution risk. The 42% year-over-year increase in share count demonstrates how quickly this dilution can occur, potentially erasing gains even if bitcoin appreciates modestly. The concentration risk cannot be ignored either. Unlike diversified bitcoin ETFs, MicroStrategy offers no protection against company-specific risks, management missteps, or regulatory challenges that could specifically target corporate bitcoin holders. The stock's correlation with bitcoin means that investors gain cryptocurrency exposure, but with additional corporate and operational risks layered on top. Your decision should start with an honest assessment of your bitcoin outlook and risk tolerance. If you believe bitcoin will significantly outperform over your investment horizon, MicroStrategy's leverage structure could amplify those gains. However, this same leverage works in reverse during downturns, making the stock unsuitable for risk-averse investors or those with short-term investment horizons. Consider your existing cryptocurrency exposure as well. MicroStrategy functions as a leveraged bitcoin play, so investors already holding bitcoin or crypto-related assets may inadvertently be concentrating their portfolio risk. The stock's extreme volatility requires firm conviction and the ability to withstand potentially significant short-term losses. Time horizon plays a crucial role in this decision. Short-term traders face the challenge of timing both bitcoin moves and MicroStrategy's premium expansion or contraction. Long-term investors should focus on whether they believe the company's bitcoin accumulation strategy will create sustainable value over multiple market cycles, while also considering the ongoing dilution risk from future equity issuances. Bottom Line MicroStrategy represents one of the most unique investment opportunities in today's market – a leveraged play on bitcoin wrapped in a traditional corporate structure. While the stock's 100%+ annual gains suggest significant upside has been realized, the investment thesis remains intact for those bullish on bitcoin's long-term prospects. However, the premium valuation, dilution risks and extreme volatility make this investment suitable only for investors with a high risk tolerance and firm conviction in the future of cryptocurrency. Rather than timing the market, focus on whether MicroStrategy's leveraged bitcoin strategy aligns with your investment goals and risk capacity.

Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is set to post second-quarter earnings after the market closes today, with investors likely to be watching its cloud and advertising revenue growth for signs of the tech giant's competitiveness amid the AI boom. Jefferies analysts said they expect Google's cloud business to benefit from strong enterprise demand and AI momentum, while analysts at Wedbush recently cautioned that the Magnificent Seven member’s advertising revenue could face challenges from a shift to generative AI search. Wall Street broadly expects Google Cloud revenue to have jumped 26% year-over-year to $13.14 billion, according to Visible Alpha, while the Street projects revenue from Google’s Search and Other division to have risen about 9% to $52.93 billion. Total revenue is expected to have increased 11% to $94.01 billion. Of the 19 analysts covering Alphabet tracked by Visible Alpha, 15 have a "buy" or equivalent rating for the stock, alongside four "hold" ratings. Shares of Alphabet were down about 1% in recent trading, and the stock is roughly flat for 2025. Options pricing data suggests traders expect Alphabet stock could see a sizable move by the end of the week. Alphabet is joined by fellow Mag 7 company Tesla (TSLA) in reporting earnings Wednesday. Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are set to report next Wednesday, with Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) expected to follow a day later. Nvidia (NVDA) isn't slated to report until late August.

Title: Amazon snaps up AI wearables company Bee

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The e-commerce giant said the deal, for an undisclosed amount, has yet to close. Amazon has confirmed that it is acquiring AI wearables company Bee. The news was first revealed via Bee’s website and a social media post from Bee co-founder Maria de Lourdes Zollo. The deal, for an undisclosed amount, is signed but hasn’t closed, an Amazon spokesperson said by email. The company sells a wristband that records, transcribes and provides feedback on conversations for about $50; a subscription service is also planned. Those plans are likely to gain steam under Amazon’s ownership. Subscriptions as sources of recurring revenue have long been a focus of Amazon CEO Andy Jassy; in its most recent quarter, the company’s subscription revenue rose 9% to $11.7 billion. In May, Jassy touted Alexa+, the agentic AI upgrade of the company’s Alexa virtual assistant, and told analysts that the company is investing in AI to further customer service innovations. All Bee employees received offers to join Amazon, though the company spokesperson declined to provide numbers. Last month, Jassy warned employees that AI was likely to lead to workforce cuts. This year Amazon announced layoffs in its North America retail and bookselling businesses.

Title: Buy AMZN Stock At $230?

Time Published: 2025-07-23T13:05:24Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock has increased by 4% this year, trailing the S&P 500’s 7% growth slightly. This modest underperformance primarily results from a mix of valuation apprehensions and the company's significant investment cycle. Having invested $53 billion into capital expenditures in 2023 and $83 billion in 2024, Amazon is now forecasting a substantial $100 billion expenditure this year, mainly aimed at enhancing its AI capabilities. While these considerable investments may affect short-term profitability, they are essential for Amazon's long-term growth and competitive advantage. At present, with AMZN trading at $230, the crucial question for investors is straightforward: should you buy, sell, or hold? We believe there is further upside potential for AMZN stock from its current levels. Our conclusion is based on an analysis of AMZN’s current valuation in relation to its recent operational performance and its current and historical financial status. Our thorough evaluation of Amazon.com across key metrics—Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience—indicates a company with robust operational performance and a solid financial base, as elaborated further below. However, if you are looking for upside potential with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative — having outperformed the S&P 500 and yielded returns over 91% since its launch. Additionally, see – Block Inc.: What’s Happening With XYZ Stock? Based on what is paid per dollar of sales or profit, AMZN stock appears costly in comparison to the broader market. Amazon.com’s Revenues have experienced significant growth in recent years. The profit margins of Amazon.com are lower than those of most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Amazon.com’s balance sheet appears robust. AMZN stock has experienced an effect that was marginally better than the S&P 500 benchmark during one of the two recent downturns. Concerned about the effect of a market crash on AMZN stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Amazon.com Stock Go In A Market Crash provides a detailed analysis of the stock's performance during and after previous market crashes. In conclusion, Amazon.com’s performance across the metrics outlined above is as follows: On the whole, Amazon.com has shown strong performance across key indicators. From a price-to-sales (P/S) standpoint, a ratio of 3.6 times trailing revenues, combined with low double-digit revenue growth, seems reasonable to us. While the current price-to-earnings ratio for AMZN may seem slightly elevated, we expect a more substantial growth trajectory in the upcoming years. This is largely due to the increasing impact of Amazon Web Services (AWS), its more profitable cloud computing segment, on the total revenue mix. Related – Amazon Stock: Path To 2x Growth. Considering these aspects, we believe there is still significant upside potential for AMZN stock from its current position. Naturally, our evaluation might be incorrect. Investors may be reluctant to assign a higher valuation multiple, especially given Amazon's considerable capital expenses, increasing competition, and slower-than-anticipated growth in certain business segments. However, if you are working with a 3-5 year investment horizon, AMZN stock could be a beneficial addition to your investment portfolio. While it appears there is further upside to AMZN stock, consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offers a responsive method to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses when markets decline, as explained in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Buy Or Sell MSFT Stock At $510?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/07/23/buy-or-sell-msft-stock-at-510/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has excelled this year, with its stock climbing over 20%. This notably exceeds the broader market performance, as the S&P 500 is up 7%, and competitors like Amazon have achieved just a 5% increase, while Google has gained less than 1%. This impressive growth is primarily attributed to strong cloud expansion—Azure revenue alone surged 33% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025—and its ongoing advances in AI integration. Microsoft’s solid position in the emerging AI boom has undoubtedly been a significant factor contributing to investor trust. However, at the current price of $510, is there still potential for growth? We believe there is. We arrived at this conclusion by evaluating MSFT stock’s current valuation against its operating performance in recent years, in addition to its current and historical financial status. Our assessment of Microsoft, considering essential factors such as Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience, indicates a company with robust operating performance and financial standing, as elaborated below. That being said, if you're looking for upside with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative—having outperformed the S&P 500 with returns surpassing 91% since its inception. On a separate note, is PepsiCo stock still appealing? See What’s Happening With PepsiCo Stock? When considering what you pay for each dollar of sales or profit, MSFT stock appears costly relative to the wider market. Microsoft's Revenues have experienced significant growth in recent years. Microsoft's profit margins significantly exceed those of most companies within the Trefis coverage universe. Microsoft's balance sheet appears very robust. MSFT stock has demonstrated a performance slightly better than the S&P 500 index during several recent downturns. Concerned about the effects of a market crash on MSFT stock? Our dashboard – How Low Can Microsoft Stock Go In A Market Crash – provides an in-depth analysis of how the stock fared during and after previous market crashes. In conclusion, Microsoft's performance across the aforementioned parameters can be summarized as follows: In summary, Microsoft stock has significantly excelled across all critical parameters, which contributes to its premium valuation. Currently priced at $510, the stock stands at 39 times its trailing earnings, marking a slight increase from its four-year average price-to-earnings ratio of 35. Nonetheless, we contend that this premium is warranted, and there exists the possibility for further growth. This optimism is fueled by impressive sales growth in Azure and improved profitability, as demonstrated by Microsoft’s operating margin expanding from 41.8% in 2023 to 45.2% now. Related – The Bull Case For Microsoft’s Next 2x Rally. Of course, our evaluation may be incorrect, and investors might hesitate to pay an even higher premium for MSFT stock considering its already elevated valuation and other risks, such as the recent security breach. Nevertheless, if you have confidence that AI growth will persist, and you possess a 3-5 year investment perspective, Microsoft is likely to be a successful stock. Not particularly fond of the volatile nature of MSFT stock? Consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio; it boasts a collection of 30 stocks and has a strong track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4 years. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns while incurring less risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a smoother investment experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Δ Or the June announcement that Siri’s AI-powered reboot, already a year overdue, won’t arrive until mid-2026. Two years after Apple Intelligence’s public debut landed with a thud. Or maybe it’s the nine-figure AI talent drain to Meta and the billions of dollars in acquisitions by Google happening just as investors digest reports that Apple has spent $10 billion chasing AI, with $5 billion more burned annually across 30 acquisitions. Apple’s investors are now nervous. They should be. Apple Intelligence doesn’t appear in any serious public Gen AI rankings. It lags behind even X.ai’s Grok. That’s not a public relations problem. It’s a strategic misstep. Maybe even a crater-sized hole that could prove Apple’s fatal flaw. Apple is 2025’s worst-performing Big Tech stock, down almost 15% to date. Microsoft, Nvidia and Meta are all up. Even Amazon and Alphabet are outperforming. Only Tesla has done worse. Maybe investors didn’t take Gen AI, and more recently, agent-driven workflows, as seriously before. Was Gen AI really all that transformative? Would people and businesses really care? The market response is yes, yes and without a doubt, yes. They and Apple are finding that AI is a technological opportunity that rewards speed. Apple hasn’t left the starting blocks. Its competitors are accelerating, iterating and launching new GenAI tools and agents across products and platforms. Apple is betting it can catch up by wiring OpenAI into Siri. A year from now. Losing the AI Race Apple’s AI failures are just one of several existential threats now facing this iconic brand. And, the signs of Apple’s structural weakness were clear long before AI became an investor and market focus. Back in October 2024, when Apple Pay turned ten, I wrote about the fault lines forming beneath Apple’s biggest business pillars. Those cracks are wider now. The combined pressures now seem existential. Tensions with China Read the Report: Apple Pay at 10 Start with China. Apple’s share of smartphone shipments is stuck at 13.9%, in fifth behind domestic brands. Its installed base is flat at 23% to 24%. Q2 saw a slight bump driven by subsidies. Geopolitical risk makes that market even more volatile. A crackdown from Beijing on American tech companies could force Apple to exit. A Taiwan conflict could imperil chip supply. At the same time, Apple faces tariff threats from both the U.S. and China. That leaves Tim Cook navigating a shrinking margin in Apple’s most important growth market while sweating about a fragile supply chain. Lost App Store Revenue Then there’s the App Store. Apple’s $20 billion profit engine, mostly fueled by in-app purchases, now has a big blinking asterisk next to it. The Epic ruling puts this once untouchable revenue stream at risk and gives developers legitimate ways to avoid paying the Apple commission. Spotify and Netflix and Amazon already use their newfound right to steer users off-platform to sign up. Stripe has published a playbook to show developers how which suggests a giant sucking sound may follow. Apple’s grip on its ecosystem profits is slipping. The $20 billion Apple receives from Google for default Safari search is also in jeopardy. The DOJ antitrust case could break that deal. And even if it survives, search is shifting to AI-driven chat and apps. The value of default placement will erode, taking Apple’s search revenue with it. Lost Search Revenue That’s why Apple is pinning so much hope on OpenAI. The thesis: if Siri gets smarter, users will stay loyal. The App Store keeps humming. The moat deepens. The stock price will reflect forward progress. Users are getting impatient waiting for Siri to get smarter. And OpenAI is also busy building its own future, not Apple’s, and doing it with one of the brains behind the design of the iPhone. OpenAI and Jony Ive are building a GenAI-native OS and device. It’s always on. Contextual. Commerce-ready with integration into ChatGPT with Shopify. This new experience is scheduled to launch in June of 2026. Timeline sound familiar? The risk to Apple isn’t theoretical. If the new OpenAI OS and connected device works as advertised, the iPhone becomes an accessory. No longer the consumer’s primary digital front door. Just another handset where real AI experiences happen independent of the handset. The iPhone becomes a commodity. Apple is facing the same risk from Google and Android. With a global market share of roughly 74% and an already-embedded AI in the Android OS, Pixel 9 has, and Pixel 10 will ship with, Gemini. Users can speak, search, transact and navigate with native AI experience and with a phone that consumers can buy now. Apple can’t match that today. The risk is how many consumers will keep waiting around for Apple to deliver. It’s a massive pain to switch from iOS to Android devices, and most people don’t. Getting an AI-powered Android device just may be enough for people to dump their iPhones. Especially if the Open AI/Jony Ive device is way cooler. Consumers will, for the first time, have a plausible choice. Apple has already seen some of that handwriting on the wall. Tim Cook warned that 2025 iPhone sales will slow, possibly falling below 2024 levels. That would mean a steady overall decline since 2021. In that year, Apple sold 242 million phones, and then saw that number slip to 232.1M in 2024. iPhone handset sales still generate 51.4% of Apple’s revenue, so selling a lot of them matters. Fewer iPhone sales means less Services revenue and a declining user base to monetize over the long term. This is why Apple tried to buy Perplexity. Apple hoped Perplexity could become something more than a commercial deal with a GenAI-native search platform with momentum, clear user growth and a model better suited to a world of prompt-based, conversational engagement. It was a way to get to market fast with a great product and a built-in team of otherwise scarce-as-hen’s-teeth native GenAI/agentic AI experts. Perplexity would have been the engine for a new, native AI-powered Apple commerce experience. One Apple could own and control. The same playbook that turned iPods into a new way to access music, iPhones into access to the digital world and the NFC chip into a mobile wallet called Apple Pay. Bolstered by the distribution from Apple’s 1.56 billion iPhones in the market. But Apple needed Perplexity more than Perplexity needed Apple. Perplexity denied having any M&A conversations. Whether they did or plan to, the right answer should be “thanks, but no thanks.” Perplexity hit an $18B valuation in less than two years’ time. It’s created a native commerce capability that is the baseline for agentic commerce connected to millions of merchants through firmly. It’s working with phone operators to install its Comet browser on phones. Sure, it could flame out. But given what it touches and could disrupt, it could also become a trillion-dollar company. It’s likely that Apple would have used the acquisition more of an insurance policy, a way to patch the hole left by a decade of underwhelming AI investments. What Apple needed, and still does, is a foundation and a clear vision for GenAI and agentic experiences. As for Perplexity, I might recommend moving up the West Coast and alphabet to Seattle and Amazon. Today, we find an iconic brand that’s wobbling and facing threats from all sides. So, what are Apple’s options? Here are a few commission-free ideas. AI Tariffs AI Tariffs. Tim Cook could channel his inner President Trump and impose an AI tariff on all native AI apps, maybe even all apps with embedded AI-native experiences, in the App Store. It could be a (by current standards) small tax of something like 3-5%. Enough to make hay while the AI sun shines, but not so much that app developers would throw up, particularly in the U.S. where Apple has a 58% share of the handset market. A Meta JV. Apple could ditch OpenAI and do a JV with Meta. It might not be as crazy as it sounds. Meta has made it clear that it will pay the big bucks to attract the best AI talent in the market. Experts with deep knowledge are scarce, and getting and keeping them means using compensation as the AI golden handcuff. Apple has lost some of its best talent to others, including Meta. Joint Venture with Meta Meta has a talent pool, and a portfolio of apps in which to embed a native, embedded AI experience. It doesn’t have a device. All of its serious AI competitors do. A JV with Apple to make Llama the AI-OS for Apple, in exchange for distribution on its handsets globally, would be complementary. And a way for Apple to potentially increase the sales of handsets globally, where its market share is a quarter of Android’s. Buy OpenAI. Apple has the cash, and Jony Ive certainly knows his way around the halls at Cupertino. It’s possible that acquiring both an AI-OS and a device that could expand the reach of the Apple ecosystem is worth it to Apple. The partnership has given them a good look at how the two firms could work together. It would give Apple a crack at creating a commerce ecosystem, and OpenAI access to Apple’s balance sheet and management team to accelerate development. Buy OpenAI None of these moves are small. But the market is moving too quickly for Apple to buy another year with demos or promises. Chipping away at the margin and banking on brand loyalty to stick it out won’t save Apple. If it wants to stay relevant, it needs to act decisively. Apple became Apple by turning technology into experiences. It didn’t just make devices, it created ecosystems. It built end-to-end worlds where hardware, software and content worked together. Companies that win in an AI-native world won’t just bolt GenAI onto existing products. Apple seems caught flat-footed for an interface that’s invisible. Where the OS is a model. Where the user interface is a conversation. Where voice is how the conversation starts and continues. Where the agent is the user experience. And where Siri, after being the first to market with a voice-assistant, continues to disappoint nearly 15 years later. In a space where speed to market is everything, and defines relevance, Apple is behind the curve. At the same time the rest of the GenAI and agentic pack, with an appreciable head start and momentum, are wasting no time to innovate, improve and drive usage and adoption. Arriving late to the party is nothing new for Apple. Tim Cook once famously said that they don’t always arrive first, but they always arrive with something better. I’m not even sure that’s true. But in any case, it’s been a long time since Apple has delivered late and better. What is true is this. The next chapter of AI is already being written. The only question is whether, where and how Apple will be part of it.

Title: Vibe Coding Turned This Swedish AI Unicorn Into The Fastest Growing Software Startup Ever

ByIain Martin ByIain Martin, Forbes Staff. Oskar Munck af Rosenschöld never planned to be in show business. But over a fika (coffee break) in Stockholm, Sweden, a film producer friend pitched him on a startup idea: a marketplace to match films with financiers, helping European moviemakers with the neverending task of raising money. Often such ideas never escape the talking stage. But just a few months later, FrameSage was live and had booked its first $50,000 in revenue—thanks to a new AI coding tool, Lovable, that Munck af Rosenschöld used to build the company’s plumbing in just 10 days. “You feel like you have the magic key to build software,” says Munck af Rosenschöld, whose works as a project mana­ger at a pharma company by day and who had never coded before outside of school. “This has saved us tens of thousands of dollars on developers and around four months’ work.” Munck af Rosenschöld isn’t the only young founder to have fallen for Lovable, Sweden’s new AI unicorn. In June alone, around 750,000 projects—apps, websites, entire businesses—were built, hosted and launched with a handful of descriptive sentences and a few clicks on Lovable. This isn’t like the clunky website builders of yesteryear, responsible for zillions of personal sites; nor are they sketches or wireframes that might look cool but aren’t functional. Lovable projects, spun up in minutes thanks to generative AI, are actual working products with features ranging from email newsletters to payments via Stripe. “I was shown Lovable and knew what I was going to do for the coming years,” says Malmö, Sweden–based Jaleel Miles, who built his restaurant management startup, Quicktables, in just two months on Lovable. He has booked over $120,000 in sales from the site since May. Lovable has become the fastest-growing software startup in history, reaching $100 million in subscription revenue (on an annualized basis) in just eight months since its launch last November, eclipsing other rocketships like Israeli cloud security startup Wiz and San Francisco–based HR platform Deel (which hit the same benchmark in 18 months and just under two years, respectively). “Humans are builders at heart, but being able to write code, or having access to capital, has been the defining part of being able to build software,” says cofounder and CEO Anton Osika, 34, who started Lovable in September 2023. “Now we are entering a new era.” It’s not just scrappy young founders who are building on Lovable. Rio de Janeiro–based QConcursos has about 200 staff helping Brazilian students prepare for college and civil service exams. CEO Caio Moretti says he used Lovable to spin up a new premium version of its app in just two weeks. It made over $3 million in its first 48 hours. “If we were coding on our legacy platform it would have taken us a year to build a new product,” he says. Photo by Sebastian Nevols for Forbes It was a pickleball tournament tracking app that did it for Accel partner Ben Fletcher. The London-based investor built the gadget on Lovable in a weekend, then spun up a tool that helps Accel sift through startup sales data. He’s now leading a $200 million round in the Swedish startup, which values the 45-person company at $1.8 billion (its cofounders’ estimated 50% stake is jointly worth $900 million). “We see Lovable as an opinionated CTO that builds your product for you,” says Osika, who has just started writing his own small checks into Lovable’s most promising projects. That $200 million, on top of the $23 million it raised previously, should help Lovable fend off competition from well-funded Bay Area rivals like Replit (which last raised $97 million at a $1.2 billion valuation) and StackBlitz—which raised $105 million in January and is on this year’s Next Billion-Dollar Startups list. But it’s not just other upstarts Lovable needs to worry about. AI giants OpenAI and Google, whose Firebase Studio can build apps and websites from prompts in simple English, are also interested in the so-called “vibe coding” market. The same tech that’s powering Lovable and its rivals is also sweeping through Silicon Valley’s professional ranks. Startups like Cursor, Cline and Cognition’s code writing tools for pro programmers are transforming how tech is built. Microsoft’s Satya Nadella claims that as much as 30% of the company’s code is now written by AI. Google’s Sundar Pichai, who has made similar claims, reportedly just spent $2.4 billion to poach the founders of Windsurf to pump up Google’s AI code tools. Once-coveted software engineers were reportedly caught up in recent layoffs at both companies. Venture fund SignalFire, which tracks tech recruitment, saw hires for entry-level coders drop by a quarter last year. But Lovable doesn’t pretend to cater to the pros. Its fans are tinkerers, designers and entrepreneurs. “Developers are really important, but they’re only 1% of the market,” Fletcher says. For entrepreneurs like Theresa Anoje, who had never coded anything beyond tweaks to her Tumblr page, Lovable has been a game changer. For years, the San Francisco–based founder wanted to build her careers newsletter, Remotely Good, into a full-fledged job-hunting website but had hit a wall with fundraising and scaling up. Then she built a new website in just a weekend with Lovable. “It was an enormous relief,” she says. “It was a revelation.” Lovable lets anyone make a handful of simple projects for free, but more-complex features and AI code requests can be unlocked with fees star-ting at $25 per month. Building something like the classic cellphone game Snake would cost the equivalent of a buck in Lovable credits, while a more-elaborate app could run upward of $50. That’s still less than the hourly rate of even humdrum human programmers. Osika himself didn’t start out as a coder, even though he’s been programming since age 12 the same type of simple games that Lovable can now build in minutes. He studied physics at Sweden’s elite KTH Royal Institute of Technology and then joined CERN, the world’s largest particle physics laboratory, in Switzerland. He lasted only a few months; CERN had a thousands-strong army of the best physicists in the world, but Osika quickly started to think the slow grind on “impossible projects” like hunting dark matter was a waste of human potential. “The realization was that you have much, much more impact being in industry, building companies,” he says. After a stint at Stockholm-based proprietary trading firm Ampfield, Osika joined an education AI startup in 2017, then signed on as cofounder and CTO at Depict AI, helping cofounder Oliver Edholm sell an Amazon-style product recommendation algorithm to retailers. They joined startup hothouse Y Combinator and within a year generated $1 million of revenue, raising $17 million in 2022 from big-name investors like Tiger Global. But Depict’s growth fizzled along with pandemic e-commerce mania, and AI began to catch fire with the launch of ChatGPT. “I was thinking, ‘We have to do this at Depict, or I have to find a way to leverage this huge wave that is coming toward us,’ ” Osika says. He was so sure of the potential that he built an AI tool dubbed GPT Engineer in his spare time, publishing it to developer platform Github in June 2023. When the app shot to the top of Github’s trending page almost overnight, Osika knew he was on to something. So he quit, recruiting former Depict staffer Fabian Hedin to be his cofounder and CTO. The duo decided to turn his code-heavy GPT Engineer into a visual tool that anyone could use. “There was this realization that this was extremely powerful,” Hedin says. They raised an $8 million seed round led by venture fund Hummingbird in October 2023. When the first version of Lovable flopped, they rewired it to handle more than simple games or static websites. Lovable raked in more than $5 million in just over a month after the team relaunched in November 2024. Lovable is now booking around $1 million a day in subscriptions, but competition is fierce. Its focus on portfolio sites and simple prototypes puts it on a collision course with an earlier generation of unicorns like Figma and website builders such as Wix and Squarespace. All these companies are also building their own AI tools. Figma launched a code generator earlier this year, and in June, Nasdaq-listed Wix spent $80 million to buy a six-month-old AI coding startup. Lovable has limitations. It aces web design, but the plumbing of more complex apps still needs a human touch. For Dutch AI engineer Lennert Jansen, a Lovable-built prototype was enough to land a spot at Y Combinator for his startup Airweave, which helps connect apps like Gmail with autonomous bits of code called AI agents. Lovable struggled with the technical back end, so Jansen and his cofounder hand-coded it and have since rewritten the remaining Lovable code. Still, accelerating the early work meant serious time savings. “If we hadn’t had Lovable, it wouldn’t have given us this tangible starting point,” Jansen says. “It was a massive win with the speed this market moves.” Now Airweave is making $17,000 a month and just landed $6 million in funding. Another vulnerability: Like many in its cohort of vibe-coding startups, Lovable relies on the same set of underlying AI models, notably Anthropic’s Claude. Lovable is spending millions of dollars a month on these models to power its coding. Some other startups are even heavier spenders, which has put Anthropic on track to make a reported $4 billion in revenue this year. Now Anthropic, last valued at $60 billion, is selling its own code tool directly. Osika can’t do much about this competition other than to stick to building products that humans love and hop between AI models for the best and cheapest. “Humans understand humans,” he says, “and Lovable is this enabling tool to make ideas come to life in minutes.” Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images DB Apple/picture alliance/DPA/Newscom

Title: Meme Stocks Are Back—Should You Be Worried?

Meme stocks are back in the spotlight. Shares of apparel retailer Kohl’s (KSS) opened nearly 90% higher Tuesday and online home buying website Opendoor’s (OPEN) shares popped nearly 20% at the open. Neither shared any business updates, but both were major topics of conversation on r/wallstreetbets, the subreddit that fueled the meme stock craze of 2021. As in 2021, a short squeeze may have been the culprit for the Tuesday morning spike. Nearly 50% of Kohl’s shares were sold short at the end of June, according to data from FactSet. The stock’s rising price could have forced some short sellers to cover their position by buying the stock, adding to the demand driving up its price. Tuesday's squeeze was relatively short-lived. Kohl’s stock pared its gains throughout the session’s first 30 minutes and ended the day 38% higher. Opendoor, which more than doubled in value last week and gained another 40% Monday, finished Tuesday's session down 10%. Come Wednesday morning, meme traders were hunting for new opportunities. Shares of Krispy Kreme (DNUT) and GoPro (GPRO) jumped 27% and 60%, respectively, in early trading, while Kohl's and Opendoor slumped. The return of meme stocks may have something to do with the stock market’s recent success. Stocks hit a series of record highs in recent weeks as Wall Street cheered tax cuts and pro-crypto legislation, and looked forward to trade deals. The Magnificent Seven rode AI excitement to trade near record highs, with Nvidia (NVDA) becoming the first company to ever reach a $4 trillion market capitalization. Speculative assets like cryptocurrencies have performed particularly well in recent months. Bitcoin traded at $120,000 on Tuesday afternoon, not far from its all-time high of about $123,000. Ethereum has rallied nearly 60% in the last month. Shares of stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group (CRCL) skyrocketed about 750% in the two weeks after its IPO in early June. There have been signs for some time that retail investors were losing interest in the Magnificent Seven after their run-up that started in late 2022. Mom-and-pop investors looking for big gains pivoted into riskier corners of the market, like small caps and more obscure AI plays, in the second quarter, according to data from Vanda Research. That trend accelerated in July, with high-beta equities like Joby (JOBY), Archer Aviation (ACHR), D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), BigBear.ai (BBAI) among the most bought stocks by retail investors this month. Flurries of speculative activity like that seen Tuesday are sometimes interpreted as signs of market frothiness, and thus precursors to pullbacks. Though that's not always the case, and even with stocks at record highs, investors have yet to pile into equities at alarming rates. Deutsche Bank's measure of equity positioning only rose from "neutral" to "overweight" last week. "In the absence of a clear negative catalyst, there is room for positioning to continue trending higher," according to strategist Parag Thatte. Update—July 23, 2025: This story has been updated with additional share prices after markets opened on Wednesday.

Title: A laid-off Microsoft manager says it's not a personal failure, but he may pivot away from management

Time Published: 2025-07-23T08:32:01Z

Patrice Melekian wanted to experience life in the US, and his job at Microsoft was his ticket. He told Business Insider he had a good, 17-year run with the company — until he got laid off from his manager job in May. He's returned to his home country of France, and while he's still figuring out his next career move, he said he might look outside management for his next role. Like many laid-off workers, Melekian doesn't know exactly why his job was cut. But he said Microsoft leaders have spoken about reducing management layers and improving efficiency — language that has coincided with manager layoffs over the past year. Melekian believes these efforts are part of a broader trend in tech. "Many companies in the tech industry, including Microsoft, have been moving to flatten their organizations to streamline the decision process," said the 54-year-old. In May, Microsoft laid off roughly 6,000 employees in an effort to increase what it calls "span of control" — or the number of employees who report to each manager, Business Insider previously reported. Then, earlier this month, the company laid off roughly 9,000 more workers. A spokesperson told BI earlier this month that the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. It's not just Microsoft. Companies like Google, Intel, Amazon, and Walmart have announced plans to reduce the number of managers. This trend, which some have dubbed the "Great Flattening," refGreat Flatteningpush to reduce costs and bureaucracy — moves some corporate executives say will make their organizations more efficient. Microsoft did not respond to BI's request for comment. We want to hear from middle managers, job seekers, and people who recently landed a job. If you're open to sharing your story, please fill out one or more of the linked Google Forms. Melekian joined Microsoft in 2007 through an acquisition, taking on a role as a program manager architect. He grew up in France and was living in Paris at the time, but became interested in moving to the US — partly out of curiosity about what it would be like to live there. In 2013, he relocated with his wife and two sons from Paris to Redmond, Washington — home to Microsoft's headquarters — to take a senior program manager role. At the time of his layoff, he was a principal product manager, leading a team of three. While Microsoft's effort to reduce management layers could leave some managers with more direct reports, Melekian said the number of people reporting to him hovered between two and three, depending on business needs — a structure he thinks worked well for his team. He said his role, which required balancing management responsibilities with hands-on project work, didn't change much during his three years as a principal product manager. Having a modest team size gave him the flexibility to spend more time on projects — something he appreciated. "When you have a team of three, you don't have to spend that much time managing," he said. "If a new opportunity came up and everybody was packed, that allowed me to jump in, take some of my own time, and go after it myself." Melekian said he started his principal product manager role during the pandemic, when remote work was widespread at the company. When Microsoft's offices reopened, he had the option to continue working from home and chose to do so. Microsoft's policy currently allows most employees to work remotely at least part of the time, though a decline in productivity could prompt a shift in policy, BI previously reported. Though a layoff is rarely happy news, Melekian said the timing was relatively fortunate: He had already been planning to move back to France for personal and family reasons. With his parents getting older, he wanted to be closer in case they needed support. His youngest son also just graduated from high school and plans to attend school in France this fall. "With our children and our own aging parents all being in France, there was nothing holding my wife and me back in the US," he said. Melekian said he's already sold his home in the US and returned to France, but hasn't started actively job hunting yet. He plans to do so later this summer once he's more settled. When his job search picks up, he's not sure whether he'll prioritize management roles or individual contributor positions. He said he may prefer a role with less managerial responsibility — one where he can have a more direct impact. "Manager roles certainly align with my experience, but I may also consider roles where I can contribute directly with my expertise," he said. Melekian said he has a few pieces of advice for people who are dealing with layoffs or career transitions. First, rely on others for advice and support. "You'd be surprised how willing people are to share their own similar experiences and help you navigate transitions," he said. Additionally, he recommended people keep an open mind to different job opportunities — and not rush their next career decision. "A layoff can feel like a personal failure, but it's usually the result of a broader business shift rather than an indication of your worth as a professional," he said. "Use the pause as an opportunity to reassess what's genuinely important for you personally and professionally." Jump to

Title: Amazon buys wearable AI device maker Bee for an undisclosed sum
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/07/22/amazon-buys-wearable-ai-device-maker-bee-undisclosed-sum/
Time Published: 2025-07-23T02:18:37Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 22:18 EDT / JULY 22 2025 by Mike Wheatley Amazon.com Inc. is buying the wearable electronics startup Bee, officially known as Bluush Inc., for an undisclosed price, as part of a strategy to take the lead in more personal artificial intelligence services. The acquisition, which has not yet closed, was announced by Bee co-founder and Chief Executive Maria de Lourdes Zollo on LinkedIn, who proclaimed that the company couldn’t have found a better partner to bring “truly personal agentic AI to even more customers.” Bee, which launched earlier this year, is the developer of a smart bracelet device called the Bee Pioneer that’s somewhat similar to Fitbit. The device sells for $49.99 per month and users must also pay a monthly subscription fee of $19.99. It acts like a very personal, wearable AI assistant that records all that the user says and everything else it hears, though it can be muted at any time. The idea is that, by listening, it gets to know users so it can create to-do lists, reminders and provide them with advice and tips. The company closed on a $7 million seed funding round in July 2024. Zollo told TechCrunch in an interview at the time that it intends to create a kind of “cloud mirror” of the users’ smartphones, with access to all of their social media and email accounts, so it can provide timely reminders and tips and send messages on their behalf. According to Zollo, the startup wants to give everyone access to “personal, ambient intelligence” that feels like a “trusted companion,” helping them to navigate their world more easily. Bee isn’t alone in sharing this ambition, but it appears to have had more success than rival AI wearable startups such as Humane AI Inc. and Rabbit Inc., thanks to the low-cost nature of its devices. Humane AI’s now-discontinued Pin, in contrast, was sold at a hefty price of $499, so it wasn’t surprising that it ultimately went out of business. Rabbit is still around, but its R1 device costs four times as much as Bee’s wristband at $199. Bee has always made a big deal about its privacy, conscious that consumers are likely to have a lot of concerns about a device that records everything they say and tracks where they go. Bee needs to store some information, of course, so it can do its job as a personal assistant, but in its privacy policy, it explains that it doesn’t save or store user’s audio recordings, and it doesn’t use them for AI training. What it does do is save information that it learns about each user — such as a summary of what they talk about, the messages they receive and so on. But it notes that they can delete all of their data at any moment, should they choose to do so. Bee has also said it’s planning to update its device so it only records the voices of those who have consented to it, but it does not appear to do this currently. In addition, it has said it’s working on a feature that will allow users to set guidelines on what the device can and cannot record, based on different topics and locations. So the device would automatically switch itself off if the user ventures into the bedroom, for example. The startup is also looking to build a more powerful device capable of processing AI data internally rather than sending it to the cloud to be processed, which is something that will increase privacy for users. That said, it’s not clear if Bee will retain these policies and goals now that it’s set to be owned by Amazon. For its part, Amazon said in a statement that it “cares deeply” about user privacy and security. A spokesperson for the company told WinBuzzer that it has been a “strong steward of customer data” ever since it was founded, and pointed out that it has never been in the business of selling personal information to third parties. The spokesperson promised to work with Bee to give users “more control” over their devices. But it stopped short of saying it will adhere to its original policy of not storing audio data, so questions remain about how strong its privacy commitment really is. Amazon has previously stirred up controversy regarding its policies for the Amazon Ring security cameras, after sharing footage they recorded with law enforcement agencies without the owner’s consent. The acquisition is a strategic move for Amazon and suggests it’s a big believer in the idea that wearables will become the next big battleground for AI as it moves beyond the smartphone. It’s not the only technology giant that seems to think so either. Meta Platforms Inc. recently invested $3.5 billion in its smart glasses partner EssilorLuxottica SA, which has been working with a number of big name eyewear brands to popularize the concept of ambient intelligence. Meta previously partnered with Bausch & Lomb Corp. to develop the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and has already sold millions of those devices, illustrating the consumer appetite for intelligent wearables. It’s now building on that with its new line of Oakley Meta sunglasses aimed at athletes. OpenAI is also looking at wearable hardware as a foundation for AI, but it’s taking a different approach by acquiring io Products Inc., a somewhat secretive startup founded by former Apple Inc. Chief Design Officer Jony Ive. Prior to the acquisition, io was reported to be developing some kind of consumer AI device with no display, but it was never made clear exactly what form factor it would take. OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman didn’t reveal much either, but instead articulated a vision of building “something beyond the legacy products we’ve been using for so long.” Bee does not represent Amazon’s first foray into wearable devices. In previously built a line of wristband health trackers called Halo, which were similar to Fitbit, but failed to make much of an impact and ultimately were discontinued it in 2023. It also sells Echo-branded smart glasses powered by its AI assistant Alexa. Support our open free content by sharing and engaging with our content and community.

Meta Platforms Inc. recently invested $3.5 billion in its smart glasses partner EssilorLuxottica SA, which has been working with a number of big name eyewear brands to popularize the concept of ambient intelligence. Meta previously partnered with Bausch & Lomb Corp. to develop the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and has already sold millions of those devices, illustrating the consumer appetite for intelligent wearables. It’s now building on that with its new line of Oakley Meta sunglasses aimed at athletes. OpenAI is also looking at wearable hardware as a foundation for AI, but it’s taking a different approach by acquiring io Products Inc., a somewhat secretive startup founded by former Apple Inc. Chief Design Officer Jony Ive. Prior to the acquisition, io was reported to be developing some kind of consumer AI device with no display, but it was never made clear exactly what form factor it would take. OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman didn’t reveal much either, but instead articulated a vision of building “something beyond the legacy products we’ve been using for so long.” Bee does not represent Amazon’s first foray into wearable devices. In previously built a line of wristband health trackers called Halo, which were similar to Fitbit, but failed to make much of an impact and ultimately were discontinued it in 2023. It also sells Echo-branded smart glasses powered by its AI assistant Alexa. Support our open free content by sharing and engaging with our content and community.

NEW YORK, July 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against AppLovin on March 5, 2025 with a Class Period from May 10, 2023 to March 26, 2025. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of AppLovin have breached their fiduciary duties to the company. The AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period created the false impression that AppLovin’s enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform, in addition to its “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. In truth, AppLovin was exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices that forced unwanted apps on customers via a “backdoor installation scheme” which inaccurately inflated installation numbers, and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. The AppLovin class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 26, 2025, analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. On this news, the price of AppLovin shares fell by more than 12%, the AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges. If you are a long-term stockholder of AppLovin, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, by telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

The decline extends the stock's 17.47% fall over the past month from its all-time high of $298.99 on June 23, based on Yahoo Finance data. The firm now sets a price target of $130 for CRCL, a further 34% fall from its current trading price. “While we expected CRCL to rally into stablecoin legislation, crypto investors typically ‘sell the news’ after highly anticipated events,” analysts at Compass Point wrote in their downgrade memo. “As such, we expect CRCL to retrace some of its recent rally after the GENIUS act was signed into law on 7/18.” The GENIUS Act marks America's first major piece of crypto legislation, creating a clear framework for the issuance and trading of stablecoins, or tokens pegged to the value of fiat currencies like that of the U.S. Dollar. While Compass Point analysts believe Circle's stablecoin–USDC–can play a pivotal role in the financial system moving forward, it believes that items like increased stablecoin competition from banks and fintech companies might be a detriment in the second half of 2025. “We expect more mainstream fintechs and banks to announce competing stablecoins in 2H25, primarily through white-labeling and/or M&A,” the Compass Point analysts said. “Many mainstream businesses have wider distribution networks than CRCL, particularly within payments.” Among others, Charles Schwab’s CEO hinted at the firm’s interest in its own stablecoin last week, following similar considerations from Citi Bank and JP Morgan. Furthermore, the analysts highlighted Federal rate cuts, waning retail interest, and the details of new revenue share agreements as potential negative catalysts for the CRCL share price. “We reach our $130 price target (PT) by applying a 25x multiple on our 2030E EBITDA forecast while applying a 15% annual discount rate. With CRCL trading at 106x our 2026E EBITDA forecast, we don’t believe investors are valuing the stock on near-term earnings,” the analysts said. Circle completed its IPO in early June, raising $1.1 billion at an offering of $31 per share. The stock nearly quadrupled in a single day of trading, outperforming the public debuts of other notable companies, including Meta, Airbnb, and Robinhood in the process.

Texas Instruments (TXN) shares dropped in extended trading Tuesday as the company issued a soft profit forecast. The analog chipmaker said it expects third-quarter earnings of $1.36 and $1.60 per share, below the consensus of analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha at the midpoint. Texas Instrument's revenue outlook of $4.45 billion to $4.8 billion came roughly in line with Street estimates. Texas Instruments shares dropped over 8% in extended trading following the release. The stock was up close to 15% for 2025 through Tuesday’s close. For the second quarter, Texas Instruments reported revenue of $4.45 billion, up 16% year-over-year and above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. Net income of $1.3 billion, or $1.41 per share, rose from $1.13 billion, or $1.22 per share, in the year-ago quarter, also topping estimates. The company's semiconductors are used in a wide variety of electronic devices, including smartphones, vehicles, and satellites. Texas Instruments has said it counts Apple (AAPL), Ford (F), Nvidia (NVDA), SpaceX, and Medtronic (MDT) among those using its products. Last month, the company announced plans to invest over $60 billion in U.S. chip production, including on seven facilities in Texas and Utah.

SpaceX has a new complaint against competitor AST SpaceMobile, warning that the company’s "tennis-court-sized" satellites pose a collision risk that could result in dangerous space debris. On Tuesday, SpaceX sent a new letter to the Federal Communications Commission, urging the agency to closely scrutinize AST’s proposal to operate 248 satellites in Earth's orbit to power cellular connectivity for everyday smartphones. AST already has five “BlueBird” satellites in orbit, each measuring 700 square feet. However, the company has plans to launch dozens of second-generation BlueBirds that are about three times larger and offer even stronger cellular connectivity. A prototype second-gen BlueBird is slated to launch in the coming weeks, following FCC approval. But in Tuesday’s letter, SpaceX claims that AST’s plan to safely orbit the proposed BlueBird constellation contains “critical gaps and inconsistencies” that raise questions about whether the satellites can avoid collisions in space while preventing debris from falling toward Earth. “Authorizing AST to launch its proposed spacecraft without resolving these issues would be irresponsible, potentially subjecting all other operators in LEO (low-Earth orbit) to unnecessary risk,” SpaceX wrote. The critical gaps include AST allegedly “underestimating” the collision risk of the company’s BlueBird satellites once they’ve been retired and “massively undercounting the number of objects it will need to avoid in its orbits.” In addition, SpaceX says AST’s application neglects to cover whether the satellites contain any “ferromagnetic components.” That’s a potential problem because AST plans on retiring its satellites by allowing them to burn up in the atmosphere. “These components are typically among the most challenging for demisability, meaning they are the most likely to survive re-entry and cause risk to human life,” SpaceX says, later adding: “AST routinely brags about the outlandish size of its satellites. But these large satellites may dramatically increase the risk of all operations in their orbits and below.” AST didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, but the company has previously accused Elon Musk of using "bullying” tactics to try to derail the competition. SpaceX has fired back, alleging that AST has its own anticompetitive efforts. Tuesday's letter underscores the simmering rivalry between SpaceX and AST. Both companies are working to offer satellite services to everyday smartphones while trying to lobby the FCC to rule in their favor. However, the dispute also highlights the safety measures around today's growing satellite constellations. For example, SpaceX has been retiring and de-orbiting hundreds of Starlink satellites in recent months by letting them burn up in the atmosphere. The satellites are designed to disintegrate completely, but in some rare instances, they have caused debris to fall to the planet. In February, the company released a report that estimated the chances of a V2 Mini Starlink satellite causing a human casualty due to falling debris were less than "1 in 100 million." In the meantime, SpaceX’s cellular Starlink service is preparing to officially launch tomorrow through T-Mobile. AST, on the other hand, is aiming to kick off its own beta program early next year through partners AT&T and Verizon.

Title: What CFOs Need To Know (And Often Don’t) About Company Workers

ByMegan Poinski andCFO ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCFO, Forbes Staff. There aren’t many good things to have come out of the Covid-19 pandemic, but a new study of finance professionals from accounts payable software maker AvidXchange pinpoints one of them: Businesses increased their readiness for the unexpected. As businesses navigate an uncertain financial future, two-thirds say they are more prepared to handle it now than five years ago, when many normal flows of global commerce were disrupted by the virus. Since the pandemic, companies have been investing more in strategic financial technology, including for automation, operational effectiveness, forecasting and productivity. Nearly three-quarters of respondents said technology implemented during the pandemic is helping them now, with seven in 10 reporting that technology is at least very important to their ability to continue to respond to market changes. Just having the technology available doesn’t mean that finance professionals are confident in what is coming next, however. The vast majority—86%—are concerned about the state of the economy, and half have deeper concerns about a potential recession. President Donald Trump’s unpredictable financial policy, punctuated by threats of high tariffs that are often delayed and revised, has made planning difficult. Nearly half of all companies are reevaluating their budgets and discretionary spending. Three in 10 are using scenario planning and financial modeling to prepare for a range of outcomes. So far, just over half have made moderate changes to their forecasts because of impending tariffs, but about a quarter that have been minimally impacted so far are monitoring them closely. Close to a fifth—17%—said the tariff threat has significantly disrupted planning and required major adjustments. This survey was taken in late spring—April to May—and many of the proposed tariffs seemed to loom much more in the immediate future. That effective date has shifted through the months, and is now set for August 1. However, one thing that hasn’t changed since this survey was conducted is the unknown nature of the immediate financial picture, which has been a consistent fog over finance departments since January. When companies are being prudent about their finances, one area where they often make cuts is personnel. However, many companies fail to share relevant people data between managers, HR and the finance department, leading companies to cut employees based on salaries alone—a strategy that sometimes will lead to vital knowledge and capabilities being cut, and ultimately losing more money in the long run. I spoke with Andrea Derler, principal in Research and Customer Value at AI workforce analytics platform Visier, about why companies need to share data to make better informed staffing cuts in difficult times. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Tuesday. Stocks climbed to fresh all-time highs on Monday. What uncertain economy? Looking at the stock market, the U.S. economy appears to be making fast progress with nothing in its way. The S&P 500 shattered records with two all-time highs in the last week—Monday and Thursday—while the Nasdaq also set a daily record on Monday. Optimism in technology, especially AI, is buoying the markets, with Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Verizon, Qualcomm and Broadcom leading Monday’s rally. Analysts are mixed on whether the rally will continue, with strategists at Goldman Sachs, Wells and Fargo projecting more growth this year. Analysts at JP Morgan Chase and Evercore ISI are projecting a decrease. Positive economic data has helped boost the markets. Unemployment claims hit 221,000 last week, down 7,000 from the week before, and June’s retail sales were up 0.6% over May, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Additionally, 83% of S&P 500 companies reporting earnings so far this quarter exceeded expectations. Alphabet and Tesla, two of the “Magnificent Seven” tech companies, will report their earnings later this week. Despite all of these positive numbers, however, tariffs are still waiting in the wings, writes Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman. According to President Donald Trump’s latest deadlines, many of them will start on August 1, and could begin to impact the prices companies and consumers pay soon thereafter. Countries and companies are working to figure out how to mitigate the majority of the impact when it comes, the Washington Post reports. Meanwhile, Forbes senior contributor Jim Osman writes that a distressing sign is emerging from consumers: 5.1% of all car loans are delinquent, marking a 15-year high in subprime loan delinquencies. Osman writes car loans tend to be the last payment Americans skip. When times are tight, they may miss a credit card, utility, mortgage or rent payment, but vehicles tend to be the last thing they will risk losing. Osman writes that credit stress is spreading as household debt increases, while credit card and buy-now, pay-later companies tighten their standards. President Donald Trump holds up the just-signed GENIUS Act with Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.) applauding next to him. The U.S. has regulations in place to govern some types of cryptocurrency. Last week, President Trump signed legislation to regulate stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies tethered to the value of assets like the U.S. dollar. The new laws put guidelines in place for banks and other entities to issue stablecoins. The new law has been hailed as a landmark moment for the crypto industry, writes Forbes senior contributor Charles Lloyd Bovaird II. Analysts told him that with regulations in place, there will be more momentum to establish and invest in cryptocurrency, both for individual investors and corporate entities. And several companies are looking into the issue. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Walmart and Amazon are considering launching their own stablecoins as a way to circumvent traditional payment systems. With the ink barely dry on the new law, the earliest impacts have come in the form of runaway valuations on Bitcoin and Ethereum stablecoins. Prices for these tokens have skyrocketed over the last week. Two other Republican-backed bills that would provide more regulation on the industry are currently before the Senate. They would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency and divide regulatory jurisdiction for digital assets between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill—dubbed the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act—the 50% tax deduction on food and drinks in the office expires on January 1, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb. Office coffee, snacks and employee meals got a 50% tax break under Trump’s signature 2017 financial policy bill, but the perk did not get renewed in the latest policy bill. (Unless you work on a fishing vessel in Alaska or a restaurant, that is.) The end of the deduction will raise $32.5 billion over the next decade, Erb writes—a relatively small increase in revenue, considering the bill includes tax cuts adding up to $4.475 trillion in the next decade. The question now facing companies is whether to continue stocking the office kitchen with goodies. A 2023 survey found that eight in 10 employees said catered meals encouraged them to come into the office, and 98% said free meals at work make them feel appreciated. But considering the other internal cost issues that may be at play in 2026, it may be challenging for companies to preserve a non-deductible employee perk. Andrea Derler, Visier Principal, Research and Customer Value. When it’s time to cut costs, financial leaders typically begin by looking at a company’s largest cost center: personnel. But the CFO’s office and the personnel department don’t always have the same data—down to agreeing on total employee counts—and the information the CFO has is usually based on numbers and location, missing important context like job functions and company plans for further growth. I spoke with Andrea Derler, principal in Research and Customer Value at AI workforce analytics platform Visier, about how everyone in the company can align on its workforce. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. In an ideal business situation, what kind of access would the CFO have of personnel data? Derler: To begin with, what type of data does the organization have? How is it currently processed and integrated? I’m exaggerating here, but she’s probably not going to be interested in seeing a spreadsheet with 300,000 employees. Ideally, it’s in a system where it’s easily accessible to the C-suite. The better it is integrated and actually prepared for results and insights, the easier it becomes. These people don’t have time to play around with the system for half an hour to get to one insight. What’s our headcount? Where’s the diversity in terms of women in leadership positions? How does our projected headcount actually affect our ability to meet our targets next quarter? That needs to be really easily integrated. In terms of the detail and what they see, hopefully they’ll work with the relevant IT and CHRO teams to understand: Can I have access to this and that because I need it for this and that? The collaborative aspect of all of these decisions is increasingly high nowadays because it’s technically possible: Understanding and negotiating access to certain data points and certain business units is really a collaborative effort. There’s a basic set of metrics that are always relevant. We need to know who is going, who is coming in the organization, particularly for workforce planning. You always need to know who is where. Engagement may not be the most important one for the CFO because it’s further away from proof to say it really affects the bottom line. Closer to that would be how many people do we have? Do we have the right skills, and how is it going to affect our projected revenue next year? What are some of the bigger things that go wrong in companies because the CFO doesn’t necessarily have access to good data from HR? We have a massive data set of [about] more 30 million employee records of global industry data. We look at that data constantly. Two years ago, we studied layoffs—reduction in force, turnover, resignation. Most companies have some type of a number we can see in our data. Then I interviewed six CHROs to understand what the decision making process around layoff positions look like? If there’s a very short term calculation: I’m going to save this much if I let 10% go in the next three months, what’s sometimes missing? Sure, you have the cost savings in the short term, but what’s sometimes neglected is what the actual long-term cost is. I’m going to let go 10% now because I think we don’t need them anymore, and currently I‘m going to have to save some costs. Sometimes, what’s not happening is thinking ahead 12 months. We want to grow again after the difficult economic times. Now, I’m going to have to rehire individuals or find new replacement employees. We know that hiring new employees is generally much more expensive than keeping existing employees and helping them either internally to find different roles or reskill them. There’s a lot of academic research and also industry research that found that layoffs most of the time are not really financially making sense because the planning capabilities don’t always exist. If the CFO knew how much it’s going to cost their company to rehire, knowing it may cost a lot more, giving us another headache in two years time, [they may advise against it]. They had only the financial data and said, ‘Oh man, we are spending way too much on wages. We’re going to have to make some cost savings.’ That’s for lack of data integration. That’s for lack of the ability to collaborate and look at the same data set and do thorough scenario planning, very much to the detriment, not only of the employees who are being let go, but even financially, it doesn’t make sense most of the time. What advice would you give to a CFO who wants to make the best financial decisions in the long run for their company when it comes to personnel, and feels like they need to have more access to information? The first thing, very practically, I would recommend that they would go to their counterparts— CHRO or IT—and find out how solidly set up they are from a technology and analytics perspective in terms of what do we have? How are we set up? Are we still working on spreadsheets? What questions can you answer for me here and now—not tomorrow, next week, not in two months, because we still have to do all the calculations manually. That would be an expectation that the CFO can reasonably have, to say, ‘Well, if we want to make good decisions, that’s what we need.’ Secondly, gauge the appetite. If it’s not in place, make a business case for it and say, ‘I will be able to make more solid financial decisions if I have the solid HR data behind me. I can make a decision faster and be more agile. That’s a big selling point. Currently, with all that’s happening in the economy, it’s very hard to plan ahead. You need agility and the ability to look something up today. Find out what’s in place. If nothing’s in place, what’s the appetite, and who are the stakeholders that I need to engage with within the company? The third important task that they could do by themselves is list what’s missing for me right now in terms of people data. These are the table stakes five questions that I need to be able to answer so I can, as a CFO, make meaningful decisions, or help at least advise the board or others on those decisions. Businesses do want to make money, but your success and longevity may depend on your ability to do something else: create value for your customers. Here are some ways to make a shift away from pure profit, but possibly a better market position. If you want to add some leadership insight to your summer reading list, here are six books to help you reflect on your shortcomings and learn how to lead your team more effectively. Last week, a TV network canceled a top-rated show because it said it was losing money—though critics have wondered if the cancellation had more to do with President Trump’s dislike of it.

Title: Mexico Biologicals Market to Worth Over US$ 2,268.76 Million by 2033 | Astute Analytica

July 22, 2025 11:30 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, July 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Mexico biologicals market was valued at US$ 853.46 million in 2024 and is expected to US$ 2,268.76 million by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 12.16% during the forecast period 2025–2033. In January 2021, the Secretaría de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural (SADER) enacted NOM-232-SSA1, the first standard that formally classifies microbial consortia as low-risk crop-protection inputs. The rule trims dossier review time from twenty-six months to fourteen and cancels duplicate ecotoxicity trials when strains already appear in the national biofertilizer catalogue. This acceleration has lured mid-sized formulators from Jalisco and Guanajuato while global players such as Koppert and Certis have opened dedicated compliance desks in Mexico City. Their joint pilot with the state of Sinaloa moved a Bacillus-based seed treatment from bench to commercial acreage in only nineteen months, a turnaround previously unthinkable. Early field data indicated strong nematode suppression and yield stability. Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/mexico-biologicals-market Regulatory momentum rippled across the Mexico biologicals market as public laboratories partnered with CONACYT to fast-track indigenous strain discovery. By 2024, the National Center for Genetic Resources in Guanajuato had sequenced 1,300 endophyte isolates from chili, avocado, and maize, creating a public database that companies can license for under US$ 6,000 per strain. This access model lowers entry barriers for start-ups while building a pipeline aligned with residue ceilings demanded by export customers. Combined with the sanitary import protocol for Guatemalan biostimulants, these measures position the Mexico biologicals market for a diversified product mix, shorter innovation cycles, and stronger traceability that resonates in domestic and North American supermarkets. Key Finding in Mexico Biologicals Market Domestic Production Capacity Expands To Meet Growing Biostimulant Demand Nationwide Industrial fermentation capacity in the Bajío corridor has grown rapidly since 2022, driven by investments from both established agrochemical contract manufacturers and bio-centric newcomers. AP Chemicals commissioned a 40,000-litre multi-strain plant in Querétaro in mid-2023, followed six months later by Rising Earth’s 18,000-litre facility in Irapuato dedicated to Trichoderma and Azotobacter production. Combined, these two sites can annually supply roughly 5.6 million liters of concentrated broth, enough to treat around 1.4 million hectares of staple crops under typical dilution rates. The plants operate under ISO 14698 cleanroom guidelines and feature inline flow cytometry, enabling real-time colony counts that reduce batch rejection to under five per year. Local sourcing of inputs such as molasses and soybean hydrolysate has improved cost predictability for the Mexico biologicals market, trimming formulation expense by roughly US$ 0.12 per liter versus 2020. Fermenters now sign forward contracts with Veracruz cane mills, ensuring a steady carbon source even during export-driven spikes. Domestic glassworks have also scaled amber growler production, cutting package lead time to twelve days. These gains let formulators quote distributors fixed prices for a whole season, a pledge once impossible. Because price swings were cited by eight of ten tomato growers as the main adoption barrier, steadier pricing should boost the Mexico biologicals market in greenhouse hubs across Sonora and Baja California. Key Crop Segments Reveal Adoption Drivers And Bottlenecks By Region Sinaloa’s export-oriented tomato and bell-pepper complexes remain early adopters of microbial pesticides, accounting for 31.5 million square meters of greenhouse area under at least one biological program in 2024. Growers there often sign integrated pest-management contracts that bundle insect parasitic fungi with pheromone traps and monitoring services; this services-first approach shortens learning curves and keeps residue levels below US FDA tolerances. In contrast, Michoacán’s avocado orchards favor biofertility solutions: more than 4,200 orchards now inject mycorrhizal blends through drip lines, targeting improved phosphorous availability on the region’s volcanic soils. This practice correlates with a 240-gram increase in average fruit weight when combined with reduced urea. Adoption inside the cereal belt is slower yet gaining. Pilot work by CIMMYT and Yara on 7,800 hectares of irrigated maize in Guanajuato showed that replacing half the synthetic nitrogen with Azospirillum cultures saved 9,300 metric tons of urea in the 2023 cycle. Still, inconsistent state extension support hampers diffusion. Farmers in Tamaulipas cited limited cold-chain capacity for liquid inoculants and uncertain shelf life as main concerns. To address this gap, the Mexico biologicals market now offers dry talc carriers that tolerate transit temperatures. The first commercial shipment reached Matamoros in April 2024, signaling a logistics fix that could double the Mexico biologicals market exposure to cultivated hectares within two seasons. Technological Alliances With Universities Boost Strain Discovery And Field Validation The Center for Applied Microbiology at Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León (UANL) operates a 6,000-isolate culture bank of desert-adapted actinomycetes. In 2023 the lab signed memoranda with three private firms granting shared IP on strains that reach commercial registration, replacing upfront licensing with milestone royalties. Under this framework, Streptomyces isolate NLS-211 suppressed Sclerotinia lesions in lettuce microplots by nearly four-fifths and triggered a 35-hectare pilot in Celaya financed by a local distributor. Such collaboration accelerates translational research and gives graduate students exposure to industrial QA protocols. The initiative is being closely watched within the Mexico biologicals market. Technology transfer is no longer confined to wet labs. UANL and software start-up AgriMetrics are building a machine-learning platform that ingests 40,000 historical agronomic records from INIFAP and generates predictive heat maps for biopesticide efficacy under different stress profiles. Field technicians use a mobile app to upload geo-tagged images; the algorithm returns optimized spray intervals within five minutes, shrinking sampling costs by one third. Early adopters include a 2,400-hectare citrus cooperative in Veracruz that reports a drop of one-fifth in copper hydroxide usage after just two cycles. As this digital layer scales, the Mexico biologicals market gains performance datasets that can be cited during SAGARPA reviews, thereby reducing uncertainty for investors and further reinforcing credibility across the Mexico biologicals market for commercial rollout. Retail Channel Evolution Enhances Farmer Access To Verified Biologicals Nationwide Historically, biologicals in Mexico moved through the same wholesalers that distribute synthetic agrochemicals, leaving farmers exposed to counterfeit risk. Since late 2022, specialized “bio-corners” inside 320 of Grupo Tornel’s ag-retail outlets have started to change that dynamic. Each corner features a trained crop advisor, chilled cabinets, and a QR-code system that links every bottle to COFEPRIS registration data. During the 2023 spring campaign, 48,000 scans were recorded, with roughly three in five scans executed by growers under 35—evidence that traceability tools resonate with a younger demographic. Retailers report a reduction of about two-fifths in expired inventory because digital stock monitoring triggers automated restocking. Suppliers, in turn, receive data during scans. E-commerce is also reshaping the Mexico biologicals market. Agrobify, farm-input marketplace, added temperature-controlled fulfilment in three cities, enabling next-day delivery of living inoculants to 14,200 postal codes. Average basket size in its biologicals category reached US$ 146 during the 2024 winter vegetable season, overtaking foliar fertilizer sales. Importantly, digital platforms integrate peer reviews; Bacillus bio-fungicides with four-plus-star ratings now sell out within 72 hours of listing. This feedback loop rewards manufacturers and pressures laggards to improve quality. As rural broadband expands under the federal Internet Para Todos program, the Mexico biologicals market stands to capture a share of online procurement, tightening the link between field data and purchase decisions. Investment Patterns Shift Toward Low-Toxicity Portfolios Amid Consumer Health Concerns Venture and strategic capital flowed decisively toward biologicals in 2023, with nine deals disclosed by the Mexican Stock Exchange related to microbial or botanical inputs. While ticket sizes remain modest—median US$ 4.8 million—more than half of the investors previously held positions in synthetic pesticide producers. Their pivot follows supermarket chains Soriana and Chedraui updating supplier charters to limit detectable organophosphate residues by 2026. Consequently, SPGG Holdings divested a 25-year-old atrazine plant and reinvested proceeds into a new fermentation hall in Monterrey designed for Bacillus lipopeptide production. Investors cite stronger gross margins, at 34 pesos per liter, owing to premium positioning and lower regulatory overhead. Analysts project reallocation trends for rounds. ESG scoring frameworks are also shaping valuations across the Mexico biologicals market. Banorte’s sustainable agriculture fund now applies a “toxicity haircut” in its discounted cash-flow models, reducing the terminal value of molecules flagged by WHO hazard classes. By contrast, dossiers backed by greenhouse re-entry intervals under four hours gain a 0.6 multiple uplift. This shift pushed a Guadalajara-based biocontrol start-up to reach financial close in just eleven weeks, a national record for ag-inputs. As auditors demand risk audits from food exporters, access to capital is poised to favor assets that reduce chemical load. For prospective entrants, aligning projects with these screens can unlock faster traction inside the Mexico biologicals market. Regenerative Agriculture Certifications Shape Procurement Choices For Major Food Exporters The surge of regenerative agriculture labels—RegenerAção, ROC Mexico, and Bayer’s PRO Carbono—has begun to influence input procurement at the field level. Export packers sourcing berries and limes for Costco and Lidl increasingly require proof of soil-health metrics such as particulate organic matter and microbiome diversity. Certification auditors now request invoices listing active microbial species and registration numbers, effectively embedding transparency requirements into farm audits. This evolution gives biological manufacturers a documentation advantage, because strain provenance and viable cell counts are already part of their QA workflow. Consequently, distributors report an uptick of just over one-third in inquiries specific to certification-compliant formulations since January 2024. Sugarcane estates are expected to follow this pattern. A concrete example lies in Jalisco, where Frutícola Zamora converted 2,900 hectares of raspberry tunnels to a certified regenerative protocol. The company replaced chlorpyrifos and carbendazim with Beauveria-based insecticides and seaweed biostimulants supplied through the Mexico biologicals market. Independent testing from Soil Food Web Lab recorded a 2.3-fold increase in active fungal biomass after one season, allowing the farm to meet ROC Mexico’s Tier-2 threshold ahead of schedule. Retail customers rewarded the shift by extending contracts from one to three years and adding a US$ 0.18 per-kilogram bonus. These financial signals reinforce the Mexico biologicals market as a core enabler of export competitiveness for specialty crops within global supply chains. Need a Customized Version? Request It Now: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/ask-for-customization/mexico-biologicals-market Strategic Outlook Highlights Opportunities In Data-Driven Product Stewardship And Traceability Looking ahead to 2026, three structural factors will likely dictate the competitive order. First, EU Deforestation-Free Regulation audits will expand traceability expectations to all upstream inputs, forcing suppliers to document microbial lineage with genome-level resolution. Second, climate volatility—2024 produced 38 days above 40 °C in northern Sonora—will intensify demand for heat-tolerant consortia capable of maintaining rhizosphere activity at 42 °C. Finally, carbon markets are moving toward outcome-based methodologies; projects verified by Mexico’s SEMARNAT accepted 312,000 tons of soil-organic-carbon credits in 2023, most of which relied on biological nitrogen-fixation models. These converging forces set the strategic stage for the Mexico biologicals market. Stakeholders therefore face compliance pressure and technology opportunity. To capitalize, stakeholders should invest in interoperable data standards that let farm-management software pull live application rates directly from smart sprayers and feed them into lifecycle-analysis tools. Manufacturers able to provide such machine-readable stewardship dossiers are expected to win procurement points with commodity traders and ESG-sensitive lenders. Equally important is after-sales agronomy: field coaches equipped with handheld qPCR units can confirm colony viability on-farm in under ninety minutes, turning stewardship into a recurring service-revenue line. By weaving analytics, verification, and support into a seamless bundle, the Mexico biologicals market can differentiate itself from generic input segments and sustain momentum through the coming regulatory and climatic future disruptions.

Title: Meme Stock Mania Is Back With Opendoor, Just As Chamath Palihapitiya’s Curse Strikes And The Housing Market Looks Poised To Crack

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Where to start with this one? Perhaps I should begin with the erstwhile "SPAC King" Chamath Palihapitiya, who led investors towards gargantuan losses once the SPAC bubble burst in late 2021. Or, maybe I should commence with leverage junkies who populate various stock fora, egging mom-and-pop investors to speculate in risky names. After all, Opendoor is a risky bet by any definition of the term. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Opendoor became a public company in the heydays of the SPAC bubble by merging with Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. II, one of nearly a dozen SPACs launched by Chamath Palihapitiya, an ex-Meta executive and a venture capitalist. Opendoor sidesteps the usual bottlenecks within the residential real estate sector by purchasing homes directly from their owners, eliminating the need for brokers entirely. The company then undertakes quick refurbishments and resells purchased property, making money from the spread between the purchase price and the selling price of any given property. Opendoor attracts customers via the convenience that it offers: a seamless process and a quick path towards a cash offer. The company's business model is designed to optimize housing turnover, while minimizing expenses such as realtor brokerage fees. Interestingly, and wholly in line with the trend among de-SPAC'd companies, Opendoor has never generated any profit. For Q1 2025, the company reported $1.2 billion in revenue, and a net loss of 85 million. Its inventory of purchased homes also increased by 26 percent on an annual basis, rising to 7,080 homes by the end of Q1. This brings us to the crux of the matter. Opendoor shares have increased by 211 percent over the past five trading days. Of course, Monday's trading activity figures for the high-flying stock were one for the history books: 1.9 million Opendoor shares changed hands, capturing around 10 percent of the total trading activity on US stock exchanges for the day, as per a tabulation by Bloomberg's Yiqin Shen. What's more, Monday also saw around 2 million Opendoor call options change hands, constituting the third highest total for any given stock in 2025, and eclipsing the combined call volume for NVIDIA and Tesla for the day. According to Goldman Sachs, trading activity in penny stocks exceeds NVIDIA's when retail investors are active in the market. And, Monday saw around 19 penny stocks exceed NVIDIA's trading activity threshold. Of course, this elevated activity could not come at a more inopportune time. According to Goldman Sachs Chief Economist, Jan Hatzius, the housing market in the US is poised for an accelerated slowdown, with residential fixed investment likely to have dropped by 10 percent in Q2. Also, in what is likely to be a bad omen for Opendoor, around 87 percent of current mortgage holders have borrowed at a rate that is below current levels. This disparity is depressing housing turnover. Sales of existing homes in 2025 are likely to total just 4.1 million units, which represents an activity level that is 23 percent below 2019 levels. Of course, these brewing dark clouds are completely in line with the performance that can be reasonably expected from Chamath Palihapitiya-linked companies, whose other bets, including Virgin Galactic, have largely floundered.

Title: Multimodal AI startup Reka AI raises $110M at $1B valuation
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/07/22/multimodal-ai-startup-reka-ai-raises-110m-1b-valuation/

UPDATED 11:00 EDT / JULY 22 2025 by Kyt Dotson Multimodal large language model research startup Reka AI Inc. today announced it has raised $110 million in fresh funding backed by Nvidia Corp. and Snowflake Inc. Founded in 2022, Reka develops multimodal models focusing on ultra-efficient training and serving infrastructure for delivering inference at low cost. The company offers multiple AI models including Reka Flash, a multimodal model capable of understanding video, images, text and audio, which is the flagship of the company’s family of models. Reka Vision and Reka Research are the company’s agentic AI platforms that have recently entered general availability providing complex question answering and visual search capabilities. According to a report from Bloomberg, the current funding round triples the company’s valuation to $1 billion, up from about $300 million after the company raised $50 million in a funding round that included the participation of Snowflake’s venture capital arm. Last year, Snowflake made overtures to acquire Reka, reportedly at a price more than three times higher than its valuation at the time. According to Bloomberg, the deal talks were scrapped after both companies decided to move on independently, but they still hold ties today. Vivek Raghunathan, vice president of AI engineering at Snowflake, told Bloomberg that Reka would provide AI models and other services to the company. “Very few teams in the world have the capability to build what they’ve built,” Raghunathan said. “Almost everyone at that level of talent is at OpenAI, Meta or Anthropic. Reka is one of the rare independents — and they’ve proven they can compete.” Reka recently released a competitively performing version of Reka Flash 3.1 that the company said shows high performance against similarly sized models such as Quen3-32B and OpenAI’s o3-mini. Reka Flash itself is a compact 21 billion-parameter model, which are the internal variables used by models to make decisions and also shape the overall size of a model impacting where it can fit. Using a method called quantization, a model’s memory footprint can be reduced, allowing it to run with less resources, such as mobile or edge devices. According to the company, Reka Quant allows for almost lossless quantization when processing Reka Flash 3.1, bringing down the size significantly with very little performance loss. According to the company Reka, Quant reduces resource usage with only a 1.6-point average degradation on hard reasoning benchmarks. The next best quantization routine incurs a 6.7-point average degradation. The company has grown from 20 to 50 employees over the past year. Although initially focused on building efficient models, Reka also develops tools to assist companies with AI interfaces and application logic. Reka said it intends to use the investment to significantly accelerate technical development on its models and scale its multimodal platforms, aiming for wider enterprise adoption and expansion of its global reach.

Title: What Amazon Prime Day Predicts About Upcoming Holiday Shopping Trends
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2025/07/22/what-amazon-prime-day-predicts-about-upcoming-holiday-shopping-trends/

ByPamela N. Danziger ByPamela N. Danziger, Senior Contributor. Amazon Prime Day saw mixed results: initial sales reports were disputed, final growth was estimated to be modest (4.9%), and web traffic declined. However, consumers showed strong purchase intent, actively seeking deals across retailers due to inflation. Analysts project 2.5-3% Q4 retail growth, highlighting consumer resilience despite economic uncertainties and potential supply chain challenges. Happy family and their daughter shopping online for Christmas Controversy erupted early on July 8, the first of Amazon Prime Day’s four-day sales extravaganza. Momentum Commerce, which manages $7 billion in sales annually on Amazon, reported first day sales were down 41% compared to last year. An Amazon spokesperson fired back, telling Forbes that the report was “highly inaccurate” and that Momentum Commerce, a third-party consultancy firm, didn’t have access to the full dataset. However, the damage was done, thanks to the anchoring bias where the news broke, it was already stained in people’s memory. Amazon’s post-Prime Day wrap-up didn’t help, since it provided no sales figures or any hint at growth. It claimed record-breaking sales, but it didn’t factor in the fact that the event went from two to four days. With two more days, Amazon was bound to break records. Questions remained even after Adobe Analytics reported that aggregated four-day e-commerce sales exceeded projections, totaling $24.1 billion in online retail sales on a 30.3% year-over-year increase. Increasingly, analysts look to Prime Day results to help forecast holiday retail performance. The apples-to-oranges comparison complicates an already complicated picture. Digging into a variety of sources provides a clearer picture of how Amazon performed over Prime Day and where the retail market is headed into the holiday season. Let’s start here: Consumers didn’t wait until July Prime Day to pick up their shopping pace. For June, retailers posted a 0.6% seasonally adjusted uptick in spending from May and a 3.7% unadjusted increase year-over-year. While Momentum’s first day report was discredited, it released a final estimate that Amazon Prime Day sales over the four days generated 4.9% total sales growth compared to the combined performance of 2024's two-day Prime Day and the two days immediately following. That fell well under Momentum’s prediction of 9.1% growth for Amazon over the four-day event. Momentum also expected that demand would be softer during the first two days and would build on days three and four. Similarweb, which tracks online traffic, found in an apples-to-apples comparison that Amazon web traffic was down. Average daily visits to Amazon.com dropped 15% comparing last year’s two-day event (July 16 and 17) to this year’s four-days (July 8 to 11). FOMO (fear of missing out) played in Amazon’s favor in 2024. And app usage followed a similar downward trajectory. Last year’s two-day event averaged 113.9 million visitors per day compared to an average of 104.1 million per day over the four-days, a 9% drop. Nonetheless, Amazon still attracted over 400 million visitors to this year’s Prime Day. However, when shoppers showed up to Amazon Prime Day, they came loaded for bear, according to a post-Prime Day survey conducted among 400 consumers by Coresight Research. Some 48% of consumers reported making a purchase, compared with 38% last year and bettering the 34% who planned to make a purchase, based on a May pre-event survey. There also was a significant increase in the share of 2025 Amazon Prime Day shoppers who reported spending more (43%) compared to 31% last year. Coresight’s consumer research also revealed shoppers widely engaged with competing sales events hosted by Walmart and Target. Over one-third of consumers reported they compared offerings across multiple retailers. They also mixed planned with spontaneous impulse buys and were motivated by early access offers and staggered promotional deals. Commenting on the survey results, Coresight’s John Mercer, who manages the firm’s global research, noted that there was a significant amount of opportunistic shopping behavior this year tied to Prime Day, as consumers sought to maximize value across competing sales events. “When consumers are cautious about inflation or the macro-environment, as we’ve seen in previous holiday seasons, they tend to pull forward some spending to spread out costs,” he said. “We think that is the case this year with consumers having concerns about inflation-driven price rises late in the season.” We’ll have to wait until Amazon reports on July 31 to get a better accounting. It’s up against a comparative 9% increase to $90 billion in North America net sales in the second quarter last year, excluding AWS. In the first quarter, North America sales advanced 8% to $92.9 billion. Looking ahead to the holiday shopping season, Mercer and the Coresight team see positive momentum, despite widespread consumer concern about tariffs increasing prices as the year advances. Coresight provided three possible scenarios for fourth-quarter retail performance. The most likely is retail growth in the 2.5% to 3% range, what it calls the central scenario. Interestingly, Coresight’s machine-learning model forecasts a 3.5% year-over-year increase, the upside scenario. However, the analyst team considers the more moderate growth forecast to be more “reasonable,” with a 45% overall probability versus a 30% probability for the upside scenario. Coresight also figures there is a 25% probability that retail sales will decline by 2.5% or more in the fourth quarter, should the economy take a turn for the worse with increased layoffs and rising prices causing consumer sentiment to deteriorate. “This would accelerate deal-seeking consumer behaviors and could ultimately contribute to stagflation (slow economic growth and persistently high inflation) or a recession (two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth),” Coresight warned. Another confounding factor that might mitigate retail growth in the fourth quarter is what Mercer described as the “lumpy” supply chain. Retailers picked up imports before April’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement, followed by a slump and another surge after the worse of the tariffs were postponed to August 1. “It makes it hard to match demand with supply,” he said. “So if we get to the holiday season and there is relatively solid consumer demand, the supply may not be there to match it. We could see a replay of holiday 2021, when consumers saw bare shelves and struggled to get some products. “Markdowns were far fewer then and more was sold at full price. So counterintuitively, we could end up seeing less discounting this holiday if the lumpy supply chain doesn’t match up to consumer demand,” he said. Despite the doomsday headlines surrounding tariff uncertainty, retail sales have climbed 3.6% through the first half of 2025 to total $4.2 trillion. While inflation inched up in June to 2.7% from 2.4% in May, it’s still below the first-half 2024 average of 3.3%. By contrast, inflation has averaged 2.6% from January to June 2025. Notably, January to June 2024 retail sales rose 2.6% over 2023 – lagging behind inflation. That’s not the case in 2025, where retail growth has outpaced rising prices, underscoring consumer momentum and resilience. “Consumers continue to spend in the face of uncertainty and shrugging off tariff concerns, with U.S. retail sales showing relative stability compared to last month and outpacing inflation compared to a year ago,” said Katie Thomas, Kearney Consumer Institute. While many observers expect retail sales to slow as the year progresses after the full force of tariffs hit, American consumer resilience could defy expectations and keep retail going strong, making Coresight’s upside 3.5% fourth-quarter growth scenario a distinct possibility.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. On Tuesday, major artificial intelligence (AI) chip manufacturers, including Nvidia NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Broadcom AVGO, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSM, Arm Holdings ARM, Marvell Technology MRVL, and Qualcomm QCOM, traded lower. This decline comes after the reports of significant disagreements between OpenAI and SoftBank SFTBY regarding the operational control and execution of the ambitious $500 billion Stargate AI project, leading to a substantial scale-back of its original scope. Internal feuds between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son have stalled the project, dramatically scaling back its grand vision, and drawing a sharp “I told you so” from Elon Musk, who has consistently questioned the venture’s financial backing. Also Read: OpenAI’s 4.5 GW Lease From Oracle Fuels Stargate’s $500 Billion Vision The Stargate AI project, initially envisioned as a massive $500 billion initiative for building AI infrastructure, has faced severe delays due to fundamental clashes between Altman and Son. Although they initially agreed to share leadership, with Altman overseeing operations and Son managing financing, their partnership has been fraught with disputes over control, governance, and strategic direction. This feud has stalled significant progress, leaving Stargate without any secured data center deals and scaling ambitions back to a single, smaller facility in Ohio by year’s end. The internal deadlock has sapped the project’s momentum just months after its high-profile White House debut. Amid a persistent shortage of Nvidia chips driven by surging AI demand, a June report indicated a growing opportunity for AMD. Companies like Oracle ORCL and OpenAI are increasingly considering AMD’s next-generation Instinct GPUs, specifically engineered for large-scale AI workloads, as viable alternatives for major projects such as Stargate, given Nvidia’s challenges in meeting supply. Arm Holdings solidified its crucial role in the AI landscape by joining OpenAI’s Stargate infrastructure project in February.

Title: Australia & Japan Are Seemingly Having Second Thoughts About the De Facto Asian NATO

Yves here. American abuse of its supposed strategic allies has gotten to be so severe and inexcusable that some are having debates in political circles and the media about why they are continuing to accept this treatment. It’s as if the abusive husband intensified his wife-beating even as his income was shrinking due to bad career moves. Admittedly, the US has been engaged in a stunning show of disrespect and preening sense of entitlement towards Europe, so there’s every reason to see if the US can pull the same stunt on the Pacific Rim. The US harmed all of Europe by promising it would do whatever it takes to beat Russia in Ukraine in a conflict the US sought, drained NATO members of weapons stocks and EU states via non-military Ukraine assistance, and harmed Europe and most of all Germany by blowing up the Nordstream pipeline. But to add insult to injury, the Trump team has threatened the EU with further harm via sanctions while acting as if Europe should further subsidize the US by buying US weapons to continue Project Ukraine, rather than let them derive some modest benefit from continued war-mongering by fabricating their own arms. Now this pattern is obviously self-destructive, but there’s at least an explanation, which is the Iron Law of Institutions. The US exerts considerable influence in EU institutions and the NGOs that are career ladders and safety nets for pols and bureaucrats. So they see upside in playing nicely with the US and risk if they don’t. My sense is that while there is, or was, fear of crossing the US among its soi-disant Asian and antipodean allies, the upside is more limited. The Andrew Korybko piece below focuses on a fresh bit of US cheek, in the barely-coded demand by Under Secretary of Defense Eldridge Colby to Japanese and Australian official to pre-commit to assisting the US if things get ugly in its planned escalation with China. Although space prevents us from giving the full context, Japan and Australia were already souring on the US before the latest demand, Renegotiating such complicated relationships won’t happen quickly, but the fact that both countries are debating whether the US is worth its ever rising price is a seismic shift. For Japan, Trump’s trade thuggery has been a slap in the face, and the US shows no interest in repairing the damage. Alienating Japan is even more epically stupid than alienating Canada, since Japan is richer and in a more geopolitically important location. Unlike the EU, Japan has also been uncomfortable with its status as a military protectorate1 but has lacked an internal consensus as to what if anything to do about it. When Trump announced his Liberation Day tariffs, Japan made a point of being one of the first to enter into talks. As former ambassador Chas Freeman recounted it, the Japanese were shocked to find the US completely unprepared, with no proposals as to what it might provide Japan and what it might expect in return, and instead thuggishly asked Japan what it was prepared to offer to escape US tariff punishment. If you have ever worked with the Japanese, they are extremely loath to complain or argue. The fact that many officials are now sharply criticizing US conduct means they are incandescent. The depth of the souring on the US is confirmed by media reports that Japan, China, and the Republic of Korea were discussing how to coordinate trade talk strategies against the US. I am pretty sure the translation below was sanitized. The key word reported elsewhere was “gangster”. Note that this was the head of the opposition party and the ruling LPD just suffered its biggest setback in 70 years in upper house elections, with the government’s poor performance in the trade negotiations cited as a big, if not the, reason: This Japanese MP (whose name is Shinji Oguma) absolutely nails it, and reflects what pretty all countries in Asia are thinking: pic.twitter.com/U1jZahc5Sh “When Japan negotiates with what [Trump] is saying it’s akin to being extorted by a delinquent.

Japan’s PM called the trade talks “a battle” and urged reduced US dependence. Seeking more from allies is fine, even appropriate. But how one does it matters because allies have domestic politics, face, agency — and yes, choices. pic.twitter.com/LIC1KgC5fQ — Rush Doshi (@RushDoshi) July 12, 2025 Now to Australia. The disgraceful AUKUS submarine deal was a massive sellout to the US. For an overview, a section from a 2023 cross post by Prabir Purkayastha: The recent Australia, U.S., and UK $368 billion deal on buying nuclear submarines has been termed by Paul Keating, a former Australian prime minister, as the “worst deal in all history.” It commits Australia to buy conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines that will be delivered in the early 2040s. These will be based on new nuclear reactor designs yet to be developed by the UK. Meanwhile, starting from the 2030s, “pending approval from the U.S. Congress, the United States intends to sell Australia three Virginia class submarines, with the potential to sell up to two more if needed” (Trilateral Australia-UK-U.S. Partnership on Nuclear-Powered Submarines, March 13, 2023; emphasis mine). According to the details, it appears that this agreement commits Australia to buy from the U.S. eight new nuclear submarines, to be delivered from the 2040s through the end of the 2050s. If nuclear submarines were so crucial for Australia’s security, for which it broke its existing diesel-powered submarine deal with France, this agreement provides no credible answers. For those who have been following the nuclear proliferation issues, the deal raises a different red flag. If submarine nuclear reactor technology and weapons-grade (highly enriched) uranium are shared with Australia, it is a breach of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to which Australia is a signatory as a non-nuclear power. Even the supplying of such nuclear reactors by the U.S. and the UK would constitute a breach of the NPT. This is even if such submarines do not carry nuclear but conventional weapons as stated in this agreement. So why did Australia renege on its contract with France, which was to buy 12 diesel submarines from France at a cost of $67 billion, a small fraction of its gargantuan $368 billion deal with the U.S.? What does it gain, and what does the U.S. gain by annoying France, one of its close NATO allies? And as Satyajit Das noted: American willingness or ability to support allies, other than with financial assistance and low risk stand-off weaponry, is questionable. Outside of minor affairs like Panama and Granada, the US record in military combat is unimpressive. For Australians tied to the US and UK through the opaque 2021 AUKUS defence agreement, the possibility of being drawn into a military conflict with China and the prospect of the American cavalry not reporting for duty is a clear concern. The parallel to Great Britain’s abandonment of Australia during the World War 2 is striking. The criticism has become even more fierce as new bad facts are coming out, including a campaign to exit AUKUS: Australia “could sacrifice sovereignty” in AUKUS alignment, says Former FM #opinions pic.twitter.com/QVf3kdPVHb — T-House (@thouse_opinions) July 15, 2025 You thought the toxic nuclear submarines were the worst part of AUKUS. It gets worse… much worse. pic.twitter.com/DEsX0fQn8y — David Shoebridge (@DavidShoebridge) July 10, 2025 Nuclear waste costs are expected to double the already nosebleed level price tag. As the Michael West site explains (which ample detail): Everything about AUKUS nuclear waste is a political secret, including the cost, which will more than double the $368B announced AUKUS price tag. Former submariner Rex Patrick with the story. If we ever get these subs, the total price tag may well be over $1 trillion. I’m in the Federal Court at present, trying to pry open a November 2023 report into how the Government intends to deal with the high-level nuclear waste from AUKUS submarines. But there’s already a lot we can deduce by combining what has been extracted from the Government using Freedom of Information (FOI) laws, from Senate testimony and also looking at how the United States does and doesn’t take care of its naval nuclear waste. For starters, there was a short but insightful exchange in Senate Estimates last year between Senator Lidia Thorpe and the head of the Australian Submarine Agency (ASA), Admiral Jonathon Mead. After making quick reference to the cost of nuclear waste facilities overseas, Senator Thorpe asked about the waste costs for AUKUS, “There’s no costing as yet; is that right?” Mead responded, “That’s correct”. For an organisation that is required to cost its capability from cradle to grave, including support facilities, it’s a huge omission. It might be the case that they’re too frightened to do the math We’ll see if the backbenchers have enough support to move the leadership: Rank-and-file Labor members in Victoria are preparing to launch a blistering attack on US president Donald Trump and demand the Albanese government withdraw from AUKUS.https://t.co/gBfNxeG8Xe — Financial Review (@FinancialReview) July 22, 2025 Now to the main event. By Andrew Korybko, a Moscow-based American political analyst who specializes in the global systemic transition to multipolarity in the New Cold War. He has a PhD from MGIMO, which is under the umbrella of the Russian Foreign Ministry. Originally published at his website Playing any role in a Sino-US war over Taiwan, even a logistical one, could provoke Chinese retaliation. The Financial Times reported that US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby recently asked Australian and Japanese defense officials how their countries would respond to a war over Taiwan. He also asked them to boost defense spending after NATO just agreed to do so during its latest summit. Colby lent credence to this report by tweeting that he’s “focused on implementing the President’s America First, common sense agenda of restoring deterrence and achieving peace through strength.” This sequence shows that Trump 2.0 is serious about “Pivoting (back) to (East) Asia” in order to more robustly contain China. This requires freezing the Ukrainian Conflict and assembling a de facto Asian NATO, however, both of which are uncertain. As regards the first, Trump is being drawn into “mission creep”, while the latter is challenged by Australia’s and Japan’s reluctance to step up. To elaborate, they seemingly expected the US to do all the “heavy lifting”, just like NATO expected till recently as well. That would explain why they didn’t have a clear answer to Colby’s inquiry about how their countries would respond to a war over Taiwan. Simply put, they likely never planned to do anything at all, thus exposing the shallowness of the de facto Asian NATO that the US has sought to assemble in recent years via the AUKUS+ format. This refers to the AUKUS trilateral of Australia, the UK, and the US alongside what can be described as the honorary members of Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan. Australia and Japan are correspondingly envisaged as this informal bloc’s Southeast and Northeast Asian anchors, yet they’re evidently unwilling to fulfill the military roles that their US senior partner expects. What it apparently had in mind was them at the very least playing supportive logistical roles in the scenario of a Sino-US war but their representatives reportedly didn’t even suggest as much to Colby. This in turn reveals that they fear retaliation from China even if they don’t participate in combat. Japan’s population and resultant economic density make it extremely vulnerable to Chinese missile strikes while unconventional warfare could be waged against Australia through sabotage and the like. Moreover, China is their top trade partner, which opens up additional avenues for retaliation. At the same time, however, neither of them wants China to seize control of Taiwan’s TSMC (if it even survives a speculative conflict) and obtain a monopoly over the global semiconductor industry. The US doesn’t want that either, but the problem is that the two envisaged anchors of its de facto Asian NATO aren’t willing to boost defense spending nor seemingly assist America in a war over Taiwan. That’s unacceptable from Trump 2.0’s perspective so tariff and other forms of pressure could be applied for coercing Australia and Japan into at least spending more on their armed forces. The endgame, however, is for them to agree to play some sort of role (whether logistical or ideally combative) in that scenario. Seeing as how the US won’t relent on its “Pivot (back) to (East) Asia”, it’ll likely coerce the aforesaid concessions from Australia and Japan one way or another. The same goes for the other members of AUKUS+, namely South Korea, the Philippines, and Taiwan, albeit with perhaps a little less defense spending from the last two. All in all, “The US Is Rounding Up Allies Ahead Of A Possible War With China” as was assessed in May 2023, but it’s anyone’s guess whether it actually plans to spark a major conflict. ____ 1 Depending on who is doing the grading, Japan’s self defense force ranks between number five and number 8 in military power. An important white paper argued for increasing defense spending from 1% of GDP to 2% by 2027. That damned stupid nuke sub deal. Of course that happened when Scotty from Marketing was Prime Minister and I think that he got a kick from doing the dirty on the French. Last I heard, he got a job with an American think tank. For both Japan and Oz – as well as all those other Asian countries – is that the demands never stop. The US wants logistical support which is fair enough. But then it wants those nations to confront China. Then it wants all those countries to hand over 5% of their GDP to the MIC which would mean buying US weaponry, even if it means all those countries will have their economies wrecked. Now the US is demanding that if the US goes to war against China, that it wants Japan and Oz to sign up as well. And that would mean that we would be dependent on an erratic, mercurial and unpredictable Trump regime to decide for us if we go to war or not. Maybe that is why our present PM went on that trade mission to China. Trying to get some sort of balance and smooth relations. So what other demands will Washington be making the next three and a half years? I hate to think. Putting my tin foil hat on, I would make an observation about those nuclear wastes. I think that in the end that they will store those nuclear wastes here in Oz. More than that, the US will lean on Oz to store their nuclear wastes too for a nominal rent as it is contentious subject in the US. I once read this American official suggest that as the uranium came from Oz originally, then Oz had a responsibility to take it back in its end form for long term storage. That argument goes nowhere. That is like saying that if the US imports coal from Canada to burn in the US, then Canada has a responsibility to take back that coal ash and any pollution as well. But you can bet that there are some in DC eyeing Oz as a destination for all that nuclear waste accumulating in the US. I think the US and UK subs will ‘just happen to be in Australia’ when it’s time to dump their waste. There’s tons of waste stuck in Portsmouth the UK doesn’t know what to do with for their useless subs. I always thought it was all about the nuclear waste disposal. The rest was face-saving window dressing for the Australian public. The date for delivery of these subs is so far away, that if it happens, I will be very surprised. Morrison allowed the US to white ant our security organisations while our minds were on COVID, this was on purpose. This was at the time he and Hurley tried to finagle the Federal Executive Council on the quiet. US defence installations here are visible to all but their security takeover is not. The US is on the wrong side of history and our deep state intends for us to go down this road with them, the only real impediment is the Gaza genocide, Marles and others are supporting the Israelis on the quiet but there is a huge resistance to this here which could derail their plans. Make no mistake, the US is sizing up Australia and Japan to be the next US proxies in a war against China – just as Ukraine has been used and abused as a proxy in a US war against Russia. Australians need to learn a lesson from Germany and the destruction of the Nordstream Pipeline. THIS is how America treats a loyal ally. And don’t think this situation is especially bad because it is Trump. Nordstream was planned and executed by the Biden Administration, as was the war in Ukraine. Take it from an American, neither party is trustworthy. If we don’t have a nuclear war, China will continue to rise and the US and Europe will continue to decline. Australia needs to hitch its horse to the winning team and its best trading partner. And for the record, China has no interest in invading Australia unless the US starts shooting nuclear weapons from its shores. The neocons and other Washington elite seem to taken the American allies (really vassal states) for granted. It was inevitable that there would be some type of backlash, owing to the abuse that they were taking. The AUKUS deal occurred during Biden and burned both the French, but later as they learned the hard way, also the Australians themselves. Not discussed in the article in as much depth is how AUKUS is worsening tensions with China. I think that many other nations are going to realize that they are not junior partners for the US, but just another colony for the US elites to exploit. Trump’s tariffs may have been the last straw for some, on top of the neocons before him that made various demands of the US vassals, such as joining the US in Iraq. The same is true about the war in Ukraine, which the US provoked to try to break up Russia. The Europeans thought that they would be a junior partner and get some part of looting Russia, once it got regime changed. Of course Russia is winning in Ukraine, while Europe suffers from loss of industry, international reputation, and living standards. The war in Ukraine was never in Europe’s interests, but their corrupt leaders went along with it. They should have done a rapprochement with Russia at the end of the Cold War. On the morality front, the US wars in Iraq, when the US lied about Saddam having WMDs, and now genocide in Palestine, by backing its proxy Israel, have damaged America’s image irreparably. I suspect that the truth about Ukraine will as well someday. It’s a loss of soft power. As the US continues to decline, and the upside of complying with US demands becomes smaller, we are going to see more of this. The US doesn’t have the industrial base, nor the military strength, and increasingly does not have the world’s best technologies to offer other nations. As the US middle class declines, the US consumer market is not as lucrative an export market anymore. The world no longer aspires to be like the US. That’s a function of the evil actions that the American elite have done around the world and the falling living standards within the US itself. Hopefully in the future, the corrupt politicians who betrayed their nations by bending the knee to Washington will be held to account in their nations and face trials, along with other legal consequences. What’s astounding is how self-inflicted America’s problems are. The US elite of this generation will go down as some of the least competent leaders in history. They were as incompetent as they were evil. That will be their final historical judgement. Can guarantee the UK won’t bandon the US. The entire political class (including Reform) are completely beholding to them. I think a part of the british elite actually lives vicariously through the american elite and their empire. You have read my mind. I got that idea from reading Churchill. Some of his post war writings give the strong impression he felt Britain was “passing” on responsibility for the world to America. And as the USA was really a descendent of Britain in his view then that meant Britain wasn’t really losing it’s place. Self induldgent nonsense really, but I think that is a view that the british elite have, at least subconsciously. Part of it might have come from the fact that he had an American mother. The right wing LNP coalition, often thought of as simply the political wing of Newscorp in Australia, immediately demanded that the centrist ruling ALP commit to fighting in Taiwan. This without the USA itself committing to it. Australians have suffered 40 years of propaganda and social engineering to make it US militarism-friendly. Australians are isolated from their political system and riven by mindless culture wars. We are prime fodder for a proxy war. The ALP has a history of internal coups to create US-friendly administrations, the first in the mid 70s and the last in 2010 where the wikileaks showed that the prime minister was ousted for not being US friendly enough in refusing to join the quad or to have a US garrison in our northernmost port. His replacement, duly signed off on by the US embassy, immediately joined the quad and let the marines in. Australians are so divorced from reality that when told that the marines were simply a ‘rotational force’ they accepted it, obviously thinking other US bases have the troops sent there for life. The AUKUS deal has just as much to do with giving our military bases to the USA as it has to do with subs. Since 1996 massive emphasis has been placed in the Australian Defence Force on ‘interoperability’ to the point it is now a provincial arm of the US military with funny accents. Doctrine, equipment and logistics is steadily being replaced with US versions. Ask an member of the military. Australians will line up for their war, they believe the newspapers. They’ll especially line up for it if the happens to be a serendipitous and precipitous downturn in the economy as has happened in Europe to create a pool of ready (hungry) recruits. Australia is the stationary aircraft carrier in the S-W Pacific wholly owned by the USA. The only real essential to its US masters being Pine Gap. The other US bases and infrastructure are just performative and for a show of strength to Asia, as any next war is, as we are seeing in the Middle East, about rocketry delivering “kinetic” payloads. A consideration that rarely gets mentioned is the obscurely named Force Posture Agreement (FPA) https://johnmenadue.com/post/2023/05/what-is-the-us-australia-force-posture-agreement-fpa/. Vassalisation complete. 94% of Australians polled as opposed to the war in Iraq, a number that simply does not exist in poling. 250,000 protested in Sydney, as in over 5% of its population then of 4 million. But to your point, when Australia (liberal John Howard) joined the coalition of the willing, Australia fell in line. The continued grumbling was minimal, although ABC and SBS did cover in great detail how horrific conditions were for Iraqis, like the looting of hospitals and severe limits on electricity (only a few hours a day). These days watching SBS is like watching a cross between Fox News and CNN. I use to watch them for the news. These days I watch it to see what the agreed upon narrative is. Australia has dutifully followed the US into every war it could since WWII. And never gets tired of reminding them. Woe betide the 1st PM not to commit to the next one. Former PM Morrison’s AUKUS brain fart was, for him first and foremost an election ploy. It was intended that he would sign the docs in person alongside a US President then call an election. Unfortunately Covid meant he got a Zoom meeting instead. Still he got a job out of it. Lobbying with fellow evangelical and neocon & former director of the CIA Mike Pompeo. Oh, so *that’s* why they pushed out Rudd, the best Prime Minister you’ve had in ages. Thanks for explaining. (Rudd speaks fluent Mandarin.) This is more Making Shit Up. I was in Australia for a few years before Rudd became PM. I had been a fan and was shocked at how quickly he imploded. He had been a brilliant opposition leader and quickly started flailing about as PM. He was a more charismatic and articulate Jimmy Carter, a bad administrator by virtue of being a micromanager. He had less excuse than Carter by virtue of not being an outsider. He was self-destructing all on his own. The real question is whether, when the shooting starts, these US “allies (with plenty of well-earned hate-America reasons)” show up. My guess is not. Andrew K. doesn’t opine. China has never been an existential threat to Japan (well at least until that pesky genocide from 1937-45, lol) The invasion of Japan by “China” was when China was ruled/occupied by a Mongol elite. Of course PRC wants to expand its sphere of economic influence, but China is never going to “Red Dawn” Japan…even if Japan is involved in a Taiwan conflict. The US creates the instability it ostensibly seeks to prevent by placing its mlilitary within a lazy 60 min. flight’s radius of China in Korea and Japan True, but this doesn’t stop the Japanese media from constantly spreading fear about China and especially the DPRK. I would say that the sources of instability are: (1) The CCP’s obsession with territorial expansion — with Taiwan, which historically was never Chinese — let it go, guys — with Tibet — with Xinkiang — with Hong Kong — with the South China Sea. You have enough land, dudes, stop being so obsessive about having more. This behavior appears threatening to everyone, including Vietnam, the Phillipines, Japan, South Korea, Myanmar, Laos, literally everyone. (2) The Kim dynasty’s desire to stay in power in North Korea despite having grotesquely mismanaged the economy to the point where they need repeated bailouts (alternating bailouts from China and Russia), and refusal to normalize relations with anyone or take a South Korean bailout. This is why the US is still stationed in South Korea. This is serious Making Shit Up, which is a violation of our written site Policies. Did you miss that Hong Kong was always part of China and only leased to the UK? China DID lose a lot of cred in the international community with their heavy handed takeover. But their right to Hong Kong is not at issue. As for Taiwan, Xi had expressed only a vague aspiration that Taiwan rejoin China by 2049. The increase in Chinese incomes relative to Taiwan would have led more Taiwanese over time to seek jobs in China (there is already some employment of Taiwanese in China) and could have achieved normalization all on its own. It’s the US that escalated, threatened by China’s ever increasing military and economic power and realizing if it were to act, 2027 was probably the latest time the US had. I am now in Southeast Asia and have a much better view than before of how aggressive Chinese businessmen very much cut the pie in their favor. The Chinese are hard core mercantilists. But that does not make everything they do unwarranted. I admit I know too little about this, but I’m wondering if, in case the Australians wanted to push back they could use Pine Gap or the Harold E. Holt joint naval communication station as leverage… somehow. Last time we tried it Mi6/CIA with the help of our own secret services ASIO overthrew the prime minister in an internal coup. Ugh, that’s terrible. :-( Thanks, James! Will look into this more. I did find this website that discusses both sites in some detail: https://nautilus.org/publications/books/australian-forces-abroad/defence-facilities/pine-gap/pine-gap-intro/ Great stuff this. It is getting more and more interesting…finally at least a bit of disagreement with the US from the East Asian vassals. Shinji Oguma summed it up. Will it all blow over, or get worse? Looks like the latter. Just an indulgent thought: what if ROK or Japan politely told the US to piss off and announced the cessation of all future SOFA (Status of Forces) agreements with the US and the eventual evacuation of all US military? What amount of financial and economic pressure could prevent such an event? That would be a historical event…it might take a while but the writing is on the wall. The US would undertake covert action against Japan and/or the ROK, to keep them in line, as it has done in the past. Why do they need covert action if the CIA owns the Liberal Democrats? And I see that extremist nationalist parties are rising in popularity again. Wonder where that came from? And I see that extremist nationalist parties are rising in popularity again. Wonder where that came from? Good question. There was an attempt, right before the election last weekend, to plant the idea of a link between Russia and Sanseito(aka the Japan First party). Wonder where that came from? Deteriorating economic conditions typically produce a rise in right wing support. As you note, the LDP is losing power in the Diet. The Japanese public has become sick of the endless scandals, corruption, dark money, and LDP connections to the whackjob Unification Church. It is entirely possible that Jiminto will become a minority party in the foreseeable future. Some of the other right-wing parties are LDP-adjacent pseudo-opposition, but may not be fully under control of the USian security apparatus. Following an electoral upset, a situation could thus arise in which the mechanisms of control that you suspect are no longer functional. (Btw, I assume this mechanism is also hypothetical, so we can entertain it as a possibility rather than a fact, but do you by chance have any hard evidence of how this mechanism of influence actually works in the present? I mean documents or credible investigative journalism or other hard evidence, i.e., not handwaving?) As Yves points out, above, economic conditions in Japan are deteriorating. Commodity prices are increasing. The price of rice has been at the center of a scandal. Ultra-right-wing parties like Sanseito are speaking to people who feel precarious, worry about food security, and want to blame foreigners. They target low information voters, of which there are many in Japan because media literacy is poor and civil society is weak to non-existent. Otherwise, it’s the usual script, nothing terribly new. This question from JohnnyJames is a hypothetical — i.e., what would happen if the Japanese leadership chose to exit ANPO, and either go it alone or else (another possibility) make peace with China, either of which presupposes that the leadership makes a decision to no longer submit to the American Empire (the “Japan that can say ‘no'”) —, and I submit that the most plausible answer is drawn from history, both in Japan and elsewhere. As John Mearsheimer has noted, the US today really looks like “the gang that can’t shoot straight” so it would make perfect sense for bureaucrats at Kasumigaseki to be quietly drawing up plans for a post-ANPO Japan, whatever that looks like. The other possibility (noted by Michael Hudson, I believe) would be that Japan becomes the Ukraine of East Asia, fighting a proxy war against China on behalf of the Empire. I assume the Japanese bureaucrats are not stupid enough to go down that path, especially given that the future of Ukraine as a nation is today rather in question, but again, a terror campaign against the Japanese public could change more than a few opinions. If China wants Taiwan badly enough, China will get Taiwan. You just have to look at a map. A long delaying action (including nominal acknowledgement of the ‘one China’ policy) is the only sensible Western policy on the matter, and to date China has seemed perfectly willing to preserve the status quo and use it as a bargaining chip. Doing nothing in response to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, as opposed to starting a massive war in the Pacific between global powers that could only end in defeat, would be a rational response. Does anybody really think the US would expend resources to protect Australia if it came under threat in the event of a defeat? Or that it could do so successfully enough to change the outcome, even if it would? Look at Ukraine. Based on past behavior the US would abandon any ally to its fate were it deemed expedient to do so. Given the purely transactional nature of any dealing with Trump and his administration, Japan and Australia … and all the others … should look to their interests. With all those US bases Japan is a big fat target should things get messy. WHat exactly does Australia gain from cozying up to the US? Stalin has been dead 72 years. The Soviet Union expired more than 30 years ago. DPRK has the A Bomb and functioning delivery systems. Their main target is US military sites in East Asian. Local nations should opt for disarmament, including any hint of U.S. nuclear umbrella. US treaty organization in East Asia would soon set very costly standards of self defense. Japan, for example, depends in part on U.S. for leaky missile defense which US in a treaty organization, would demand Japan provide. Japan, ROK and Oz should give non aligned peace a chance. A good round up on this is whether we could say ‘no’ at all with such a large US security presence in-country. https://www.sydneycriminallawyers.com.au/blog/with-so-much-local-us-military-presence-can-australia-really-say-no-to-a-war-on-china/ These countries can be better allies by telling America to shut down these crazy unwinnable wars or threats of war/trade wars. But I suspect they cannot, and after a while the only reasonable action for them to take is to reach out to China and form a relationship there more closely aligned to their national interests.

Title: Nvidia Stock To Crash In 2025?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/07/22/nvidia-stock-to-crash-in-2025/
Time Published: 2025-07-22T12:56:21Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has risen by 23% since early January and remains up almost 80% from lows seen in April as AI driven demand remains strong. However, there are concerns. One word. Okay, two maybe. Customer concentration. In Q1 FY’26, (ended April 2025) Nvidia disclosed that one customer accounted for 16% of revenue and another for 14%, both tied to its Compute & Networking segment. That’s up from 11% and 13% sales from two direct customers in the same quarter a year ago. We’re worried about that. Imagine paying close to $35 billion a year to Nvidia. How long is that going to happen? Separately, is PepsiCo stock still attractive? See What’s Happening With PepsiCo Stock? Although Nvidia doesn’t name them, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Meta are widely understood to be among its largest customers. These customers are in the middle of an unprecedented AI spending spree. Amazon is expected to spend up to $105 billion on capex in 2025, while Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta are forecast to spend as much as $80 billion, $75 billion, and $72 billion respectively, much of it earmarked for AI infrastructure. A substantial portion of this will flow directly to Nvidia for GPU purchases. AI data centers also require costly land, building, electricity infrastructure, cooling, and networking systems. However, we aren't so sure these companies will keep investing the way they have on AI in the longer run. Why is that? Sketchy Returns on AI Investments The economics of the end market for AI, particularly for GPU-driven applications, remains uncertain. Most of Nvidia’s customers likely aren’t generating meaningful returns on their investments yet. Let’s take Google, for instance. Its core search business, which generated over $170 billion in 2023 via ad sales, is being disrupted by AI-powered search tools such as Perplexity, and ChatGPT. While Google has built Gemini, a cutting edge AI search offering of its own, it does not currently offer a comparable monetization model. That said, Waymo has a 2x potential for Google. As shareholders eventually seek better returns on investments, we could see capital spending on GPU chips cool off, impacting the likes of Nvidia. Model Training Slowdown? Over the past two years, companies have heavily invested in AI model training, with Nvidia’s GPUs emerging as the top choice on account of their performance and efficiency. AI model training is a compute-intensive process that may eventually slow. Unlike traditional cloud growth, AI model training is compute-heavy but often front-loaded making a slowdown in future GPU demand quite possible. Incremental performance gains are expected to diminish as models grow larger, and the availability of high-quality training data could become a bottleneck. As training demand declines, GPU demand could weaken. Now training these massive models is more of a one-time affair that requires considerable computing power and Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of this, as its GPUs are regarded as the fastest and most efficient for these tasks. Compare evolution of Nvidia valuation over time. Building In House AI Chips At the same time, big tech giants aren’t relying solely on Nvidia - they are all actively developing their own custom AI chips. Google is building its TPU chips, while Amazon, Microsoft with Maia, and Meta too, have their own silicon developments focused on AI. While these chips have a long way to go to match Nvidia’s performance in compute heavy training tasks, they could be well optimized for their respective company's AI models and code. Moreover, by building their own chips, these companies could be looking to increase bargaining power with Nvidia and create some independence from Nvidia’s supply chain and pricing. Even if Nvidia maintains its technological edge, the concentration of its revenue in a handful of hyperscalers, who are both customers and emerging competitors, could be a vulnerability. Impact on Nvidia Stock NVIDIA's Revenues have surged by over 2x over the last year and are on track to grow by over 50% this year per consensus estimates. While the stock trades at above 40x estimated FY'26 earnings, this isn’t too high considering the company's growth rates. That said, these projections assume hyperscaler demand continues unabated. A pullback from any major customers - whether due to internal chip development, more cautious AI returns, or overall tech spending moderation – could lead to lower pricing, lower volumes, and a sharp erosion of profitability. This is especially critical for a company like Nvidia, where such a large share of revenue is tied to a handful of customers. This could lead to a sharp contraction in valuation multiples. The risks here aren't hypothetical, either. Recent evidence from 2022 shows that NVDA stock lost over 60% of its value within just a few quarters. In fact, the stock fell by close to 35% over Q1 2025 due to concerns about tariffs. This could very well repeat itself if big customers show signs of cutting back on spending. Not too happy about the volatile nature of NVDA stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Drive more traffic to your site. Use AI to save time doing SEO tasks. Make SEO easier. And get 24/7 support. Includes Local SEO, Video SEO & News SEO. Black Friday is the biggest rush of the year for most ecommerce businesses, and it is right around the corner. The most successful merchants prepare for Black Friday early and follow a structured plan to prepare their stores, ensure visibility, and convert first-time visitors into long-term customers. This guide breaks down your preparation into three categories: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each section builds on the last so that you can grow your readiness over time, regardless of your team size or budget. These actions lay the groundwork for everything else. Without these, no advanced strategy will stick. First impressions matter, and your metadata is the first thing users see in search results. So make it count and leave a lasting impact. Why it matters: Strong metadata can improve visibility and attract more clicks. When your titles and descriptions align with what shoppers seek, your chances of standing out rise significantly. Actionable tips: With Yoast SEO for Shopify and Yoast WooCommerce SEO, you can preview and improve your metadata in real time. The tools flag missing or duplicated fields and guide you on how to write content that earns clicks. Product pages are the moment of truth. They’re where curiosity turns into clicks and clicks turn into customers. Why it matters: No matter how great your traffic or ads are, most people will leave without buying if the product page feels confusing or incomplete. A well-structured page improves your chances of ranking in search and helps buyers feel confident in their decision. Actionable tips: Yoast WooCommerce SEO and Yoast SEO for Shopify help your product pages appear cleanly and clearly in search results. They add structured data behind the scenes and check your content for SEO and readability so you can focus on turning visitors into buyers. Internal linking guides customer to surface key pages, maps user behavior, and boosts your site’s SEO. Why it matters: Internal linking helps search engines understand your site structure, distributes authority to key pages, and guides visitors toward high-converting content. It keeps users engaged, supports SEO, and makes your promotions easier to surface across your site. Actionable tips: Yoast WooCommerce SEO offers internal linking suggestions as you write, making keeping your content connected and strategic easier. Once you have set up the basics, some steps can help you boost impact quicker and avoid costly missed opportunities. Fast wins: Big pitfalls to avoid: Once the technical foundation is stable, it’s time to focus on your content and promotions. Site speed directly impacts user experience, especially during high-traffic periods like Black Friday. Slow-loading pages frustrate shoppers and lead to lost sales. Why it matters: A fast site supports smoother browsing and quicker checkout. Search engines consider page performance in rankings, and users are more likely to buy when the experience feels seamless. Actionable tips: While Yoast SEO is not a speed optimization tool, clean site structure and proper internal linking help improve crawlability and engagement, indirectly supporting performance. Your landing page is the command center for your seasonal promotions. It’s where visitors decide to browse further or bounce. Why it matters: A dedicated page gives your Black Friday campaign direction and cohesion. Instead of scattering your offers across the site, it provides a clear path for shoppers to follow. It simplifies navigation, allows for better internal linking, and gives you a consistent, trackable URL for email campaigns, ads, and site banners. Plus, it’s reusable! Just update the content each year. Actionable tips: Email isn’t just another marketing channel during Black Friday; it’s your direct line to customers ready to buy. Why it matters: Blasting the same message with monotonous tone to everyone no longer works. Crafting compelling emails with personalized messages that resonate with the reader is key to email marketing. People are more likely to open, click, and shop when an email speaks to their pain points and highlights the solution. A segmented email list means you’re talking to people based on what they care about: early access, bundles, or a product they viewed or left in their cart. Actionable tips: For more on syncing content and email, check out our basics of email marketing blog post. Buyers don’t always search for discounts. Many start with questions or ideas like “affordable gifts for coworkers” or “best tech gift under $100.” Why it matters: Helpful blog posts and gift guides pull in people who aren’t searching for your brand yet. These early touchpoints introduce your products and lead them toward your Black Friday offers. Actionable tips: Once your product pages are polished, tighten up the surrounding details. Fast wins: Big pitfalls to avoid: Unlock powerful features and much more for your online store with Yoast WooCommerce SEO! If you’re already doing the essentials well, these strategies will help you scale. If you offer in-store pickup or have a physical store, don’t miss out on the people searching near you. Shoppers looking for same-day purchases often skip past online-only stores. Why it matters: When someone searches for a product near them, being present in the results can drive instant foot traffic and build trust before they even walk in. Actionable tips: Yoast Local SEO is included in the Yoast WooCommerce SEO. It helps you create and manage local schema and landing pages that appear in search. (It is not available for Shopify.) When someone searches for a product and your listing shows price, availability, or reviews, that’s not luck. That’s structured data. Why it matters: Rich snippets give your products more space in search results, credibility, and clicks. Actionable tips: Yoast SEO for Shopify and Yoast WooCommerce SEO automatically adds this, but you can also fine-tune it for special products or campaigns if needed. Black Friday may be over at checkout, but it’s just the beginning of your relationship with a new customer. Why it matters: People who buy during Black Friday often need reassurance and support. They’re far more likely to come back if they feel taken care of. Actionable tips: Taking care of this now means you can focus on fulfillment and service during the Black Friday rush. A thoughtful follow-up and last check make sure you build on opportunities and are ready for what might come your way. Fast wins: Big pitfalls to avoid: Preparing for Black Friday is about being proactive, not reactive. Every SEO improvement you make now, from product pages to local visibility, will help you attract more shoppers and turn clicks into customers. Yoast gives you the tools to stay ahead: clearer product listings, stronger search visibility, and smart automations that scale with your store. Whether you’re using Shopify or WooCommerce, optimize now to be ready before the crowds arrive.

Title: One of Wall Street's biggest bulls sees tech powering an 11% gain in stocks through the rest of 2025

The US stock market looks like it's going to keep powering through to new records, says one of the biggest bulls on Wall Street. Christopher Harvey, the chief US equity strategist at Wells Fargo, predicts that the S&P 500 will reach 7,007 by the end of the year. His forecast — now one of the most optimistic on Wall Street — implies the benchmark index climbing another 11% from its current levels, or a 19% gain for the year. Speaking to Bloomberg about his thesis on Monday, Harvey pointed to a handful of reasons that would keep the market climbing higher: AI boom. Mega-cap tech stocks will likely keep climbing higher, Harvey said. He brushed off concerns that the hype over artificial intelligence resembled the dot-com bubble in the 1990s, noting that many companies today have stronger fundamentals. Large-cap tech and AI stocks have been on a tear since their low in early April, shortly after President Donald Trump announced his Liberation Day tariffs. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF is up 41% from its April 8 low. "What we're seeing is the winners continue to win. The uber-cap companies have the higher margins, are gaining more market share. There is a real secular trade in AI that will continue," Harvey said. Strong mergers and acquisition activity. Dealmaking has remained relatively strong on Wall Street, another factor that should support the market, Harvey said. Strategic M&A activity was up 11% year-over-year from January through May, according to an analysis from the consultancy Bain & Company. "We think that M&A will continue to be very, very healthy up and down the capitalization," Harvey added. The US consumer remains strong. Americans keep spending, despite concerns that tariff-related price increases could shut off an important engine of the economy. Consumers ramped up their spending more than expected last month, with retail sales rising 0.6%, according to the US Census Bureau. The Fed is likely to cut interest rates. The central bank looks on track to eventually lower interest rates despite hesitation stemming from President Donald Trump's tariffs in recent months. Investors are pricing in two or three rate cuts from the Fed by the end of 2025, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Those bullish factors override any concerns investors have over the market, Harvey said, pointing to concerns about the impact of tariffs and Trump's escalating feud with Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Investors are worried that tariffs could raise inflation while hampering economic growth, and that Trump could interfere with the Fed's independence, which could stoke inflation down the line. "We had seen Trump 1.0. We know his style," Harvey said, referring to the belief that the president goes hard on his policies before softening his tone. Harvey was one of the few strategists on Wall Street who stuck to his original S&P 500 target for the year, even during the historic sell-off in April as Trump unveiled his slate of tariffs. Forecasters like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan lowered their stock forecasts and lifted their recession odds, before reversing once Trump paused most tariffs. Jump to

This article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly. It doesn’t really matter who you are, how you spend your time online, or what you imagine your relationship with the internet to be. However you scroll, wherever you browse, and whatever you want to see on your screens, it has probably happened to you, and if you haven’t noticed yet, you may now: Your world has become more Reddit. The 20-year-old platform, which began as a niche link aggregator and gradually grew into the web’s default community of communities, has gone from optional to inescapable, its little red alien logo manifesting no matter which way you look. For my zoomer cousin, a professional TikToker who was still learning to read when Reddit was founded, it’s obviously “the only place where you know there are real people.” For 82-year-old user LogyBayer, who grew up programming FORTRAN on punch-card computers in the 1960s, Reddit, where he has posted thousands of times, is the closest thing he can find to “the wondrous world of Usenet,” the online discussion system that predates the web. Many of the less online people I know, who had maybe heard of Reddit, are now tapping through threads about life advice and HVAC repair; at the same time, some of the most online people I know, who for years saw Reddit as a sort of internet playpen, a meme aggregator downstream of more vital communities, are now logging in daily. It’s happened to me, too, a screen-addled tech reporter who has been covering the platform’s growth — and various problems — for well over a decade with at least notional remove: When it’s time again to pick up that phone and incinerate a few more seconds of my one life on earth, more often than not, I shovel them into Reddit. This isn’t just a feeling. Reddit, after two decades of gradual and uneven growth, is exploding. According to Similarweb, it’s one of the largest properties online; if you take away social apps like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, and utilities like Google and ChatGPT, its closest competition among websites is Wikipedia. In 2023, according to the company, Reddit had around 60 million unique visitors a day; its latest earnings report puts the number at 108 million a day, 400 million a week, and, according to conservative estimates, well over a billion different people using it every month. About those earnings reports: In 2024, Reddit went public. Its stock price popped, then climbed alongside its traffic. Revenue is way up, and after years of losses, the company eked out a slim profit in the last quarter. Why now? Reddit’s co-founder and current CEO, Steven Huffman, suggests the answer is obvious. “When we started Reddit, it was a web page of 25 links from around the internet,” he says. “Now, 20 years later, you’re stumbling into some thread where people are telling stories they’ve never told before and it drifts into life advice for someone who lives 2,000 miles away.” He didn’t see that coming, he says, but “in hindsight, it actually makes a lot of sense.” For years, Reddit, which is made up of thousands of sub-Reddits moderated by volunteers, offered a centralized and streamlined alternative to the web’s thousands of small and scattered forums, message boards, and independent communities. At the same time, in contrast with the much larger social-media platforms that rose around it, it looked niche. “The word social media didn’t exist” when the site was launched, Huffman says. Since then, in his telling, the company has steered away from influencer culture and growth-at-all-costs social-media scaling — “we don’t want people to be famous because of Reddit,” he says — and toward realizing “the vision of the old web.” Another way to tell the story is that the platform largely just stayed put. In any case, as the mega-platforms merge into TikTok-clone sameness, Reddit’s steady focus on giving online randos a place to pseudonymously post with one another is paying off. In Huffman’s view, Reddit’s growth is simply its reward for stubbornly — maybe accidentally — “fulfilling the promise of the internet.” It’s a good story, and there’s something to it. But just out of frame, there are … a few other relevant things happening online, each as obvious to the typical browser as Reddit’s sudden come-up. The World Wide Web from which Reddit grew, and for which Huffman expresses so much reverence, has been going through something akin to ecological collapse after being poisoned, then abandoned, by advertisers that have little use for independent websites anymore. At the same time, the rise of generative AI suggests a lot of people are just as happy — if not happier — getting life advice, news, and conversation from a robot that has read a bunch of sub-Reddits as they are chatting with internet strangers themselves. Reddit’s place in the collapsing web is both valuable and risk-laden. Google’s response to the gradual breakdown of the digital commons has been to send more and more people to Reddit, where relevant results are at least probably written by human beings, lavishing the site with traffic but binding the companies’ fates together. Reddit’s relationship with AI is similarly tense: As a training corpus, Reddit is immensely valuable; after years of unauthorized scraping, the company has official licensing deals with Google, which sometimes turns its content into AI-generated search “Answers,” and with OpenAI, which uses Reddit’s vast archives to give its chatbot depth and outside sourcing and to help it sound like a normal person — or at least a normal redditor. Meanwhile, Reddit moderators are battling a flood of inauthentic content generated by chatbots that were trained, of course, on Reddit. They’re getting tired while users, less certain that other commenters are real — and less sure of their ability to tell and noticing the rising tides of slop elsewhere — are drifting into mutual suspicion. Huffman suggests that, just as Reddit was rewarded for offering an alternative to more baldly growth-and-ad-driven social media, it could serve a similar role in the post-ChatGPT world as a refuge for actual human interaction in a sea of generated text. “Social media made Reddit make more sense, and I think now that the web is kind of dying, sadly, that evolution helps Reddit make more sense,” he says. “Reddit in that era is, Reddit is not social media. And now, we’re entering this new era where Reddit is not AI.” It’s a powerful pitch, to the extent it remains true. But it doesn’t quite capture just how strange and risky Reddit’s position is in 2025. Being one of the last islands of humanity on a dying web may make you more appealing to, well, humans. But it also makes you even more valuable to the companies doing the killing. Reddit is an alternative to a web that’s harvested, polluted, and depleted by tech firms in a race to dominate AI. It’s also an increasingly valuable data source for tech firms in a race to dominate AI. How long can it be both? Reddit has occupied a series of strange, sometimes contradictory positions in the public imagination over its 20 years of existence: a nerdier alternative to Digg, whose users it inherited after a redesign gone wrong; a platform overwhelmed by young men who were, at different times, in the tank for Ron Paul, Barack Obama, and Bernie Sanders; the world’s leading aggregator of revenge porn; a crusading platform against revenge porn; and a staging ground for Donald Trump’s online campaign, among many others. At different times, and to different people, it was an obscure “dark corner” of the web, an unbearably “cringe” platform downstream from real internet culture (akin to 4chan or, actually, its polar opposite); a platform of free-speech crusaders; a hive of groupthink and censorship; and ground zero for an ongoing retail stock-trading boom that has since outgrown it. Through it all, the platform has remained in some ways remarkably consistent. (As the critic Alex Pareene wrote a few years ago, Reddit went “from merely embarrassing but occasionally amusing, to actively harmful, to — mainly by accident — essential.”) In 2005, Reddit looked a lot like it does now, a list of links on which users voted up or down. By 2008, it worked a lot like it does now, with comments, sub-Reddits created and run by the community, and the rise of self-posts — threads without links, created to talk, argue, or share things directly. To a user in 2008, Reddit was legible as a forum of forums, a new and centralized take on the sorts of scattered web communities where people used to spend a lot of time on a much smaller internet. To a user in 2025, this can make it feel like a throwback. We’re further from Reddit’s founding than Reddit’s founding was from the creation of the web browser. It still basically operates within structures and norms established on dial-up bulletin-board services and email lists: communities sorted by interest, volunteer policing, and threads upon threads of text. Reddit’s formal and cultural stubbornness — and its roots as a mid-aughts gathering place for (mostly) young men interested in technology and the stunted online culture of the time — has helped and haunted it for its entire existence. Huffman, who co-founded the site with his college roommate, Alexis Ohanian, and the late activist Aaron Swartz, left the company after it was acquired by Condé Nast in 2009. (In 2011, Condé Nast spun off Reddit into an investable subsidiary of Advance Publications. Its $10 million investment would eventually be worth more than $2 billion.) Huffman returned in 2015 after a series of user and moderator revolts driven, in part if not completely, by the attempts of CEO Ellen Pao to figure out what to do about growing communities with names like Jailbait, Pics of Dead Kids, Fat People Hate, and Beating Women. He did so with a mandate to square the platform’s need for growth with the desires of a user base that was incredibly allergic to being told by the company what it could and couldn’t do. “It’s kind of an egotistical thought,” Huffman told New York Magazine at the time, “but I felt like I’m literally the only person in the world who can fix this and I had a moral obligation to do so.” There was resistance within the company, too. “Huffman stepped into what was basically a company on fire and was met by employees who were either disgruntled, burned out, or just done with the drama,” says Christine Lagorio-Chafkin, author of We Are the Nerds, a book about Reddit’s history. “Half the staff left within days.” This was, in hindsight, the beginning of a long process of growth-and-revenue-oriented taming and professionalization with occasional top-down mandates and a few more user revolts — the most recent in 2023 after the company limited access to developers, threatening third-party apps and tools used by moderators, resulting in mass sub-Reddit blackouts and a moderator exodus. The company by turns tolerated, managed, or crushed user backlash on the way to the big prize: Reddit’s IPO. In May 2024, shares in Reddit started trading on the New York Stock Exchange, its $34 listing price valuing the company at $6.5 billion. In July 2025, shares trade above $150. “It’s almost as if he made a list of all the things that had haunted Reddit as a site for years and built systems to dismantle them,” Lagorio-Chafkin says of Huffman. In person and as the trollish and frequently maligned “spez” on Reddit, he served for years as a representative of and foil for some of the site’s most vocal (or at least stereotypical) users: a millennial white-guy programmer who enjoys arguing a little too much for his own good. Post-IPO, Huffman is now much wealthier — his shares in the company are worth north $600 million — and, as is customary in his San Francisco cohort, conspicuously muscular. After years of corporate expansion, Reddit is starting to resemble the larger tech companies he likes to use as foils. In 2015, when he returned, Reddit had fewer than 75 employees. Now, it has more than 2,300 staffers and a market cap of $28 billion. It’s also — finally — turning a profit. It would be an overstatement to say Reddit’s transition into a publicly traded online platform was smooth. “We’ve lost a lot of moderator skill since the IPO,” says one longtime volunteer who communicates regularly with Reddit’s leadership. These tens of thousands of moderators aren’t just helpful — they’re operationally crucial, keeping the site organized and (relatively) hospitable. The 2023 revolt drove a lot of people out, and the loss of third-party tools for dealing with the workload was a pain for the ones who remained. (At the time, Huffman compared protesting mods to entitled “landed gentry”; among volunteers, the episode is still referred to as “fuck spez.”) Before Reddit developed its own replacement tools, another moderator tells me, “We had a solid year of unchecked spam hitting all sub-Reddits.” At the same time, mods were dealing with a new problem: AI. “With text-only subs, we see increased attempts by people generating fake stories,” the moderator says, and discerning the difference between AI posts and typical Reddit comments was suddenly much harder. Image-based sub-Reddits, suddenly glutted with generated material, scrambled to come up with rules — “constantly disputed,” the mod says — and struggled to enforce them. Suddenly, spammers and trolls had superpowers. Earlier this year, researchers at the University of Zurich dispatched “semi-automated, AI-powered accounts,” which identified themselves variously as rape victims, trauma counselors, and Black men opposed to Black Lives Matter, to a sub-Reddit called /r/changemyview, where the researchers claimed they achieved “persuasive rates between three and six times higher than the human baseline,” leaving users annoyed and moderators enraged. (A majority of the accounts used in the study, however, were flagged at the time by Reddit’s automated systems.) Meanwhile, the longtime mod says, recruiting new help has gotten harder. “People hate you. The people who want to do it are power hungry, and the really good ones burn out.” They also have somewhat less control than they used to (they can no longer lock down their sub-Reddits in protest, for example). “I think the company is under a lot of pressure to remove power for moderators,” he says. “I need more people, but Reddit would like people to have less power.” Laura Nestler, Reddit’s VP of community, says managing mods is crucial to the platform’s survival. “They’re stewarding their communities, they’re building the norms, building the rules and enforcing their independent individual rules,” she says. “Our goal is just to empower moderators and communities to do what they’re gonna do.” Mod drama isn’t a sideshow. Like Wikipedia, Reddit works only if people feel like posting there and if moderators feel like volunteering hours a week — or a day — to keep things clean, civil, or at least functional. Unlike Wikipedia, Reddit is a for-profit company, which makes its volunteer model fragile in different ways. (For an idea of what happens when your army of volunteer contributors loses interest in boosting your company’s bottom line, look no further than the rotting corpse of Quora.) Before the IPO, Reddit offered some longtime moderators early access to its stock. Now that they’re volunteering for a public company, though, some are floating another idea: Maybe they’ll need to get paid. Still, the transition happened, and the admin-mod-user relationship that keeps Reddit running remains more or less intact. “I think what’s underappreciated is that he continued what Ellen started,” Lagorio-Chafkin says — cracking down on hate speech and harassment and building “sturdier internal teams.” As a result, she suggests, Reddit is far larger, more functional, and more diverse than ever, with sub-Reddits for just about any pastime or interest you might come up with, often filled with more people than you might expect. According to the company, Reddit is now used by slightly more women than men, and, unlike a lot of other large platforms, its share of young users is growing. Fandoms have sub-Reddits, and so do brands. The platform functions broadly enough to host, for example, a massive sub-Reddit for Uber-rider stories and complaints (“Driver picked me up with her infant and boyfriend in the car”) as well as a sub-Reddit with more than 420,000 subscribers for Uber drivers (“She peed herself in my car. I can’t blame her”). Any sufficiently popular sub-Reddit eventually spawns a “circlejerk” counterpart in which users mock the host sub-Reddit. Reddit is also far more international despite English still being the dominant language. It’s not uncommon, particularly in sub-Reddits devoted to personal stories and advice, to realize that the difficult in-laws in question live in Bhopal or that the requested product recommendations need to be available for purchase in Jakarta. More surprising, perhaps, is the persistence of one of Reddit’s less publicized functions, even through its IPO and efforts to court mainstream advertisers: There are still massive amounts of porn on it with thousands of sub-Reddits filled with just about any sort of adult content you can think of and quite a bit more. The largest isn’t even an aggregator: On /r/gonewild, which has more than 5 million subscribers, redditors post nude photos of themselves. Plenty of the dynamics resemble, as Huffman suggests, an extension of the “old web” ethos of community and connection, albeit enabled by new internet techniques. Once built purely around a unified front page and followed sub-Reddits, users now get algorithmic recommendations. As with any such system, this has the effect of making the platform feel larger and, at times, more isolating. There are also more ads than there used to be (Reddit’s revenue last year was just $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion of which came from advertising). Still, from the inside, Reddit remains recognizably Reddit. Strains of its dominant 2010s culture have become less important if not less obvious, aging and mutating with some of its most devoted longtime users. There are plenty of kids there talking about kid things, and a surprising number of elderly people, too, but there are also, unmistakably, a ton of American college-educated millennials, many of whom now have jobs and children and whose once-nerdy interests and sensibilities have become, with some help from Reddit itself, genuinely mainstream — so much so that the site’s name on the platform and elsewhere has become a pejorative shorthand for normie millennial tastes. There are large and active conservative and pro-Trump sub-Reddits, but the largest and most extreme MAGA communities have been officially banned by the company or marginalized in the community, meaning America’s dominant political movement is rendered on the platform’s most popular sub-Reddits as an absurd and enraging external force and as fundamentally incompatible even with Reddit’s commercialized approximation of a shared, deliberative commons. Posts fishing for earnest responses from Trump supporters are more likely to be answered by young liberal redditors venting about their parents. Years of failed attempts to create a conservative alternative to Reddit have instead culminated with a migration back to X, with which Reddit is now engaged in a sort of simmering mega-scale forum war. (Early this year, Elon Musk lashed out at Reddit, where some sub-Reddits had banned links to X, and privately pressured Huffman to step in.) One way to understand Reddit is as a largely functional, self-sustaining community that its leadership managed to avoid fucking up — an old and sturdy system that remains, against all odds, basically intact. But this alone doesn’t explain its growth or the situation it finds itself in now. For Reddit to grow as it has — suddenly and massively despite largely staying the course — it required some help. First, it needed the web to collapse around it and social networks to chase TikTok into video-recommendation oblivion, leaving readers desperate for anything resembling actual human discussion. Then it needed Google. In 2019, on the tech-industry Reddit clone Hacker News, users discussed a blog post about missing the “old internet,” pining for the days before it was ruined by the “commercial smog thrown up by Google.” Multiple commenters shared the same advice: “I’ve taken to appending ‘reddit’ to many of my search queries, because flawed though it is, Reddit is one of the few places you can read an actual human thought,” one wrote. Sure, Reddit was still a “cesspool,” full of bullshitters and tiresome “in-jokes” of its own, commenters said, but the advice was well received — and prescient. Reddit users shared the tip, the company itself publicized it, and the “reddit” hack went mainstream. By 2022, Google had taken notice and adjusted its search algorithms in a way that surfaced Reddit more often, particularly in response to open-ended questions, and said it would guide users toward “helpful content” and more “first-person perspectives.” By 2023, search analysts were tracking dramatic increases in Reddit’s visibility on Google; one report estimated that Reddit had gone from “57 million visits from Google U.S. … in July 2023 to 427 million in April 2024.” Reddit’s own numbers told a similar story: The mature, newly public company, which had been fighting for incremental growth its whole life, was suddenly tracking like a viral start-up, its total traffic growing yearly by half with no signs of slowing down. At first in its earnings reports, the company was slightly coy about what was going on, emphasizing how important Reddit had become to Google, not the other way around. (“Reddit was the sixth-most-Googled word in the U.S.,” Huffman noted at the time.) Reddit’s disclosures told the story more clearly: It reported that logged-in users — i.e., people who already had Reddit accounts — were up 27 percent globally, while its logged-out visitor numbers were up 70 percent. There are plenty of reasons the internet feels more Reddit these days, but none are as important, nor as straightforward, as this: Google, in an effort to cope with its own rotting search index, has been sending us there by the hundred million. In an interview, Huffman emphasized that this isn’t entirely new and that Google has been sending people to Reddit in unpredictable quantities for years: “We get a ton of traffic from Google today. We know that’s not forever. We’ve seen it in our history. It comes and goes.” While a recent collapse in Google traffic has been a disaster for e-commerce operations and online publishers, Huffman says, such changes wouldn’t be a disaster because — again — Reddit remains Reddit. “We have a lot of content that Google likes, and the reason Google likes it is because we didn’t generate it for them,” he says. But without the massive assist from Google, the past few years of Reddit’s story look quite different. Adam Bumas, an analyst with research firm Garbage Media, has been tracking upvotes on popular sub-Reddits since Reddit shut off access for most outside tracking tools. Despite the influx of new visitors, this sort of active participation has remained flat — a story, Bumas says, of “maintaining rather than growing.” Without Google’s firehose of visitors, other risks come to the fore: competition from platforms like Discord, the real-time chat platform popular with younger users, where many sub-Reddits already have a presence; the growing preference among advertisers for video rather than text; and, of course, the rise of chatbots. There are also reasons to suspect that, today, Reddit’s past relationship with Google may not be a reliable guide. Google’s uses for Reddit aren’t just about search, nor have they been merely convenient: In February 2024, the company announced it was “expanding its partnership” with Google, allowing for “new ways for Reddit content to be displayed across Google products” but also for Google — which was by then spending tens of billions of dollars a quarter pivoting to AI — to train its models on Reddit’s vast corpus of “authentic human conversations and experiences.” For Google, spooked by the rise of ChatGPT, this was urgent. By May, it had rolled out AI-generated “answers” above its search results, many of which were clearly drawn from the platform, but which, by design, were far less likely to send users there. When the feature made headlines for a viral AI-generated search result that suggested adding glue to a pizza recipe, the backstory implicated Reddit: Google’s AI had misread an 11-year-old joke from a Reddit user called “fucksmith.” It was funny, of course, but also told a particular story about the future of the platform. Reddit — the last website, the imperfect and commercially conflicted steward of the “promise of the internet” — was being harvested to train tools that purport to be able to do a lot of what Reddit users do for one another: answer questions, provide recommendations, open rabbit holes, indulge argument, and waste time. It was training its own replacement. From inside the platform, Reddit’s relationship with AI is unremarkable. There are large active communities of AI enthusiasts sharing productivity hacks as well as sub-Reddits full of apocalyptic doomers, sci-fi optimists, and total skeptics. Users routinely call out comments that appear to be AI-generated and lament the rise of AI slop outside of Reddit’s (relatively) safe perimeter. Moderators see a rise in AI-generated engagement bait and comments — more, they say, than Huffman admits — but they don’t see it as a crisis, at least not yet. As a business, Reddit has been pushing further into AI-powered moderation and has polled users about AI content-creation tools. With users, it has moved cautiously, launching an internal AI search tool that lets users browse threads through a chat interface. To advertisers, it has been a little more aggressive, pitching them an “AI-powered social listening tool designed to unlock strategic value from Reddit’s 20 years of conversations.” But Reddit’s careful approach to AI features is misleading: Except for Wikipedia, maybe, no independent website has provided as much raw training data for as many AI firms, authorized or not, as Reddit. As a corpus for machines trying to sound or reason like people, it’s immensely valuable: pre-organized, pre-moderated, cleaned and sorted by the input of millions of volunteers and users, and written, unlike so much else on the web, without SEO, traffic, or advertisers in mind. Likewise, its relationship with OpenAI runs deeper than the deal announced in early 2024 through which Reddit licensed data to OpenAI for training and to bring Reddit content directly into ChatGPT. In 2015, the day after OpenAI was founded, Sam Altman, in a joint interview with Musk, mused that “all of the Reddit data would be a very useful training set” for building future AI; earlier that year, Altman, who had by then known Huffman for a decade, helped orchestrate his return as CEO but not before serving as CEO himself for a week. Altman was an early investor in Reddit and sat on its board until 2022. Huffman, who still regularly speaks with Altman, is hardly an AI skeptic. But when it comes to AI’s impact on Reddit — at least in his capacity as a CEO — he’s fairly sanguine about the future. “There are times the AI is superpowerful, and there are times when you just don’t want it,” he says. Sure, some of what people get from Reddit, they may soon be able to get from chatbots trained on it. “It can give you lots of decent answers to a wide variety of questions,” Huffman says. And there’s no doubt AI will rip through the economy of the web, which is already filled with cheap and largely replaceable content. “AI is going to kill the bullshit because AI is better at bullshit,” he adds. Reddit has plenty of bullshit too. But a lot of questions brought to Reddit, Huffman says, are questions without clear answers — the sorts of questions where, even if you’re not asking them yourself, you’re there to read what other people think, work things through, argue, and joke around. “I think what will stay constant is that human beings want to talk to each other,” he says. “People like talking. They like asking questions, they like hearing answers, they like giving answers, they like having a few laughs, they like being helpful.” The big social platforms don’t offer that anymore, and chatbots can’t either. “The core of Reddit actually becomes more valuable over time when the rest of the internet turns into AI.” In the background, though, Reddit has started acting a bit more paranoid. As a measure against bot-generated content, Reddit is reportedly considering partnering with World ID, an iris-scanning crypto and identity start-up (started, of course, by Sam Altman). The company recently sued OpenAI competitor Anthropic for allegedly scraping its “vast corpus of public content” for its “enormous utility” and has threatened to sue the university researchers who ran the undercover AI experiment. Meanwhile, brands, advertisers, and spammers are reportedly swarming the platform hoping to cash in on Reddit’s visibility in both Google Search and in AIs trained on and monitoring its posts. As insular and resilient as Reddit has been, it’s a resource that needs to be maintained and one that could be depleted. The through-line in Reddit’s history is that it has always been forced to answer to its users and thousands of volunteer moderators, whether or not what they were demanding made sense for Reddit as a community or a company. In some ways, this dynamic surely held them back. But just as clearly, in hindsight, it probably kept the entire project alive. Huffman likes to emphasize that Reddit has been through a lot. When it launched, nobody was using the internet on smartphones, and the tiny company saw MySpace, Friendster, and Xanga as unassailable incumbents. It watched as they collapsed and were replaced with true giants, which shape-shifted as they grew, all the while remaining fundamentally and stubbornly the same. “Look, we’ve been around 20 years,” he says. “So we have, I think, some perspective and comfort with the way the internet evolves.” When I ask about risks, he spins to synergies. The trashing of the web, the lavish attention from Google and AI firms, the scrutiny of investors who care about returns above all — these are fundamentally aligned with Reddit’s interests and will carry it to the next billion users. Huffman is more optimistic than ever about Reddit’s internal tensions, too, having gotten, in his view, the platform’s worst instincts under control. He recalls with clear satisfaction a recent conversation with a longtime moderator: “He’s like, ‘As a shareholder, how are you thinking about growth?’ And I was just like, Oh, hallelujah.” Reddit’s most devoted volunteers, he says, “used to tell us not to grow.” By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.

Title: Apple needs to leave its ‘comfort zone’ on AI. Elon Musk could help.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Apple’s struggles with artificial intelligence are becoming critical. It needs to do something big to be a real player in that area, and a partnership with Elon Musk’s xAI could be the ticket required, according to Melius Research. Apple has repeatedly delayed promised AI updates to Siri, its digital assistant. That has undercut hopes that such an upgrade could revive growth in iPhone revenue, which has stagnated since hitting $205 billion in Apple’s fiscal 2022. Apple shares were down 16% this year as of Friday’s close. The prospect that Apple will be able to deliver an impressive AI-enabled iPhone on its own is becoming more remote. The company recently lost one of its top AI researchers—Ruoming Pang, who led its machine-learning foundation model team—to Meta Platforms, according to The Wall Street Journal. That means the focus is on Apple’s potential to strike a deal with an external AI partner. Melius’s Ben Reitzes says Elon Musk’s xAI could be the ally it needs. “Apple could provide xAI with the users it needs to top [ChatGPT developer] OpenAI in return for giving Apple all the benefits of owning an LLM [large language model] without the capex," wrote Reitzes in a research note on Monday. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from Barron’s on its AI plans. Any AI deal that Apple strikes with a third party risks its lucrative relationship with Alphabet’s Google, in which the iPhone marker receives a percentage of the ad revenue from searches on its devices. The arrangement, which makes Google the default search engine on Apple devices, led to a $20 billion payment from Google to Apple in 2022, according to court filings. However, the Google-Apple deal is already at risk, with a judge currently considering potential curbs on the search-engine company after ruling last year in an antitrust lawsuit brought by the Justice Department that it had acted as a monopolist. That could make the time ripe to look elsewhere. A deal offering Apple a cut of subscriptions to xAI’s products could offset a loss of revenue from the Google deal. One drawback of a partnership with xAI would be to leave Apple dependent on an external partner and a controversial one at that, with xAI’s Grok chatbot having recently published a number of antisemitic posts. The company subsequently removed the posts and said they were the result of unauthorized changes made to the chatbot. Apple’s preference for tight control over its platforms could mean it prefers to buy an AI provider. The search specialist Perplexity is a potential target frequently mentioned by analysts. Acquiring Perplexity could cost Apple more than $20 billion, considering its latest valuation of around $18 billion, but would likely still boost its shares, according to Reitzes. The Melius analyst calculates that if 100 million Apple users bought Perplexity’s Pro Tier subscription at $200 a year, that would completely cancel out the potential loss of Google payments. “Tim Cook and his team are likely to be rewarded for thinking bolder to accelerate Apple’s AI push, even if they have to step out of their comfort zone," Reitzes wrote. News Corp, the owner of Barron’s publisher Dow Jones, has sued Perplexity, alleging copyright infringement. News Corp also signed a multiyear partnership with OpenAI in March 2024. The stock was up 1.3% at $213.97 in early trading. Reitzes has a Buy rating and $240 target price on the stock.

Nilesh Shah of Envision Capital in an interview to ET Now said that India has always been and will continue to be a small and midcap-driven market. While largecaps form the core of a portfolio, he believes that real wealth is created when investors identify and nurture promising companies early. According to him, this space consistently offers greater upside potential for those willing to hold with conviction. Nilesh Shah asserts that stock picking remains an eternal truth in investing. Regardless of whether one is investing in largecaps, midcaps, or smallcaps, careful selection of stocks is vital. He stresses that this principle holds true for all types of investors and professionals, including fund managers and CIOs. In his view, India’s diverse market provides an unmatched canvas for skilled stock pickers. Nilesh Shah points out that India’s market includes over 4,000 to 5,000 listed companies, a result of past conditions where high interest rates and underdeveloped VC/PE ecosystems pushed companies to go public early. He notes that only around 200 qualify as largecaps and a similar number as midcaps, leaving a massive small and microcap base. For Shah, this vast investable universe is a unique strength of the Indian market. According to Nilesh Shah, India’s continued economic growth—6–7% real and around 10% nominal—supports the long-term outperformance of mid and smallcap companies. He argues that as India moves from a $3,000 to $9,000–$10,000 per capita income, these companies are poised to benefit the most. Shah believes short-term corrections are insignificant if one keeps the long-term growth narrative in mind. Nilesh Shah observes that the last few years have seen a historic wave of IPOs, particularly in the mid and smallcap segments. He explains that earlier, many IPOs were premature due to capital constraints, but now companies are entering the market at a more stable stage. For Shah, this evolution has enriched the mid and smallcap ecosystem and created better long-term investment opportunities. Nilesh Shah highlights a major shift post-COVID, where a new class of tech-driven businesses has gone public. From online broking to food delivery and insurance platforms, he notes that these firms are leveraging technology to reach consumers faster and scale efficiently. According to Shah, these developments make the mid and smallcap space increasingly dynamic and future-ready. Nilesh Shah acknowledges that while some IPOs came with high valuations, subsequent corrections have offered buying opportunities. He advises that investors who have done their homework could take advantage of such dips. Although today’s IPOs may not be as attractively priced as in the past, Shah believes they still offer high-quality growth stories for long-term investors. Nilesh Shah concludes that India’s mid and small-cap universe is rich with long-term potential. He urges investors to look beyond short-term volatility and instead focus on structural growth trends, digital transformation, and strategic stock selection. Shah remains confident that these segments will continue to drive market performance over the coming decade.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Hey! Before we go any further — if you want to support my work, please sign up for the premium version of Where’s Your Ed At, it’s a $7-a-month (or $70-a-year) paid product where every week you get a premium newsletter, all while supporting my free work too. Also, subscribe to my podcast Better Offline, which is free. Go and subscribe then download every single episode. One last thing: This newsletter is nearly 14,500 words. It’s long. Perhaps consider making a pot of coffee before you start reading. Good journalism is making sure that history is actively captured and appropriately described and assessed, and it's accurate to describe things as they currently are as alarming. And I am alarmed. Alarm is not a state of weakness, or belligerence, or myopia. My concern does not dull my vision, even though it's convenient to frame it as somehow alarmist, like I have some hidden agenda or bias toward doom. I profoundly dislike the financial waste, the environmental destruction, and, fundamentally, I dislike the attempt to gaslight people into swearing fealty to a sickly and frail psuedo-industry where everybody but NVIDIA and consultancies lose money. I also dislike the fact that I, and others like me, are held to a remarkably different standard to those who paint themselves as "optimists," which typically means "people that agree with what the market wishes were true." Critics are continually badgered, prodded, poked, mocked, and jeered at for not automatically aligning with the idea that generative AI will be this massive industry, constantly having to prove themselves, as if somehow there's something malevolent or craven about criticism, that critics "do this for clicks" or "to be a contrarian." I don't do anything for clicks. I don't have any stocks or short positions. My agenda is simple: I like writing, it comes to me naturally, I have a podcast, and it is, on some level, my job to try and understand what the tech industry is doing on a day-to-day basis. It is easy to try and dismiss what I say as going against the grain because "AI is big," but I've been railing against bullshit bubbles since 2021 — the anti-remote work push (and the people behind it), the Clubhouse and audio social networks bubble, the NFT bubble, the made-up quiet quitting panic, and I even, though not as clearly as I wished, called that something was up with FTX several months before it imploded. This isn't "contrarianism." It's the kind of skepticism of power and capital that's necessary to meet these moments, and if it's necessary to dismiss my work because it makes you feel icky inside, get a therapist or see a priest. Nevertheless, I am alarmed, and while I have said some of these things separately, based on recent developments, I think it's necessary to say why. In short, I believe the AI bubble is deeply unstable, built on vibes and blind faith, and when I say "the AI bubble," I mean the entirety of the AI trade. And it's alarmingly simple, too. But this isn’t going to be saccharine, or whiny, or simply worrisome. I think at this point it’s become a little ridiculous to not see that we’re in a bubble. We’re in a god damn bubble, it is so obvious we’re in a bubble, it’s been so obvious we’re in a bubble, a bubble that seems strong but is actually very weak, with a central point of failure. I may not be a contrarian, but I am a hater. I hate the waste, the loss, the destruction, the theft, the damage to our planet and the sheer excitement that some executives and writers have that workers may be replaced by AI — and the bald-faced fucking lie that it’s happening, and that generative AI is capable of doing so. And so I present to you — the Hater’s Guide to the AI bubble, a comprehensive rundown of arguments I have against the current AI boom’s existence. Send it to your friends, your loved ones, or print it out and eat it. No, this isn’t gonna be a traditional guide, but something you can look at and say “oh that’s why the AI bubble is so bad.” And at this point, I know I’m tired of being gaslit by guys in gingham shirts who desperately want to curry favour with other guys in gingham shirts but who also have PHDs. I’m tired of reading people talk about how we’re “in the era of agents” that don’t fucking work and will never fucking work. I’m tired of hearing about “powerful AI” that is actually crap, and I’m tired of being told the future is here while having the world’s least-useful most-expensive cloud software shoved down my throat. Look, the generative AI boom is a mirage, it hasn’t got the revenue or the returns or the product efficacy for it to matter, everything you’re seeing is ridiculous and wasteful, and when it all goes tits up I want you to remember that I wrote this and tried to say something. As I write this, NVIDIA is currently sitting at $170 a share — a dramatic reversal of fate after the pummelling it took from the DeepSeek situation in January, which sent it tumbling to a brief late-April trip below $100 before things turned around. The Magnificent 7 stocks — NVIDIA, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), Apple, Meta, Tesla and Amazon — make up around 35% of the value of the US stock market, and of that, NVIDIA's market value makes up about 19% of the Magnificent 7. This dominance is also why ordinary people ought to be deeply concerned about the AI bubble. The Magnificent 7 is almost certainly a big part of their retirement plans, even if they’re not directly invested. Back in May, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reported that Microsoft (18.9%), Amazon (7.5%), Meta (9.3%), Alphabet (5.6%), and Tesla (0.9%) alone make up 42.4% of NVIDIA's revenue. The breakdown makes things worse. Meta spends 25% — and Microsoft an alarming 47% — of its capital expenditures on NVIDIA chips, and as Bratton notes, Microsoft also spends money renting servers from CoreWeave, which analyst Gil Luria of D.A.Davidson estimates accounted for $8 billion (more than 6%) of NVIDIA's revenue in 2024. Luria also estimates that neocloud companies like CoreWeave and Crusoe — that exist only to prove AI compute services — account for as much as 10% of NVIDIA's revenue. NVIDIA's climbing stock value comes from its continued revenue growth. In the last four quarters, NVIDIA has seen year-over-year growth of 101%, 94%, 78% and 69%, and, in the last quarter, a little statistic was carefully brushed under the rug: that NVIDIA missed, though narrowly, on data center revenue. This is exactly what it sounds like — GPUs that are used in servers, rather than gaming consoles and PCs (. Analysts estimated it would make $39.4 billion from this category, and NVIDIA only (lol) brought in $39.1 billion. Then again, it could be attributed to its problems in China, especially as the H20 ban has only just been lifted. In any case, it was a miss! NVIDIA's quarter-over-quarter growth has also become aggressively normal — from 69%, to 59%, to 12%, to 12% again each quarter, which, again, isn't bad (it's pretty great!), but when 88% of your revenue is based on one particular line in your earnings, it's a pretty big concern, at least for me. Look, I'm not a stock analyst, nor am I pretending to be one, so I am keeping this simple: In simpler terms, 35% of the US stock market is held up by five or six companies buying GPUs. If NVIDIA's growth story stumbles, it will reverberate through the rest of the Magnificent 7, making them rely on their own AI trade stories. And, as you will shortly find out, there is no AI trade, because generative AI is not making anybody any money. I'm so tired of people telling me that companies are "making tons of money on AI." Nobody is making a profit on generative AI other than NVIDIA. No, really, I’m serious. If they keep their promises, by the end of 2025, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Tesla will have spent over $560 billion in capital expenditures on AI in the last two years, all to make around $35 billion. This is egregiously fucking stupid. As of January 2025, Microsoft's "annualized" — meaning [best month]x12 — revenue from artificial intelligence was around $13 billion, a number that it chose not to update in its last earnings, likely because it's either flat or not growing, though it could in its upcoming late-July earnings. Yet the problem with this revenue is that $10 billion of that revenue, according to The Information, comes from OpenAI's spend on Microsoft's Azure cloud, and Microsoft offers preferential pricing — "a heavily discounted rental rate that essentially only covers Microsoft's costs for operating the servers" according to The Information. In simpler terms, 76.9% of Microsoft's AI revenue comes from OpenAI, and is sold at just above or at cost, making Microsoft's "real" AI revenue about $3 billion, or around 3.75% of this year's capital expenditures, or 16.25% if you count OpenAI's revenue, which costs Microsoft more money than it earns. The Information reports that Microsoft made $4.7 billion in "AI revenue" in 2024, of which OpenAI accounted for $2 billion, meaning that for the $135.7 billion that Microsoft has spent in the last two years on AI infrastructure, it has made $17.7 billion, of which OpenAI accounted for $12.7 billion. Things do not improve elsewhere. An analyst estimates that Amazon, which plans to spend $105 billion in capital expenditures this year, will make $5 billion on AI in 2025, rising, and I quote, "as much as 80%," suggesting that Amazon may have made a measly $2.77 billion in 2024 on AI in a year when it spent $83 billion in capital expenditures. [editor's note: this piece originally said "$1 billion" instead of "$2.77 billion" due to a math error, sorry!] Last year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that “AI represents for sure the biggest opportunity since cloud and probably the biggest technology shift and opportunity in business since the internet." I think he's full of shit. Bank of America analyst Justin Post estimated a few weeks ago that Google's AI revenue would be in the region of $7.7 billion, though his math is, if I'm honest, a little generous: Google's "One" subscription includes increased cloud storage across Google Drive, Gmail and Google Photos, and added a $20-a-month "premium" plan in February 2024 that included access to Google's various AI models. Google has claimed that the "premium AI tier accounts for millions" of the 150 million subscribers to the service, though how many millions is impossible to estimate — but that won't stop me trying! Assuming that $3.1 billion in 2025 revenue would work out to $258 million a month, that would mean there were 12.9 million Google One subscribers also paying for the premium AI tier. This isn't out of the realm of possibility — after all, OpenAI has 15.5 million paying subscribers — but Post is making a generous assumption here. Nevertheless, we'll accept the numbers as they are. And the numbers fuckin' stink! Google's $1.1 billion in workspace service revenue came from a forced price-hike on those who use Google services to run their businesses, meaning that this is likely not a number that can significantly increase without punishing them further. $7.7 billion of revenue — not profit! — on $75 billion of capital expenditures. Nasty! Someone's gonna get mad at me for saying this, but I believe that Meta is simply burning cash on generative AI. There is no product that Meta sells that monetizes Large Language Models, but every Meta product now has them shoved into them, such as your Instagram DMs oinking at you to generate artwork based on your conversation. Nevertheless, we do have some sort of knowledge of what Meta is saying due to the copyright infringement case Kadrey v. Meta. Unsealed judgment briefs revealed in April that Meta is claiming that "GenAI-driven revenue will be more than $2 billion," with estimates as high as $3 billion. The same document also claims that Meta expects to make $460 billion to $1.4 trillion in total revenue through 2035, the kind of thing that should get you fired in an iron ball into the sun. Meta makes 99% of its revenue from advertising, and the unsealed documents state that it "[generates] revenue from [its] Llama models and will continue earning revenue from each iteration," and "share a percentage of the revenue that [it generates] from users of the Llama models...hosted by those companies," with the companies in question redacted. Max Zeff of TechCrunch adds that Meta lists host partners like AWS, NVIDIA, Databricks, Groq, Dell, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Snowflake, so it's possible that Meta makes money from licensing to those companies. Sadly, the exhibits further discussing these numbers are filed under seal. Either way, we are now at $332 billion of capital expenditures in 2025 for $28.7 billion of revenue, of which $10 billion is OpenAI's "at-cost or just above cost" revenue. Not great. Despite its prominence in the magnificent 7, Tesla is one of the least-exposed of the magnificent 7 to the AI trade, as Elon Musk has turned it into a meme stock company. That doesn't mean, of course, that Musk isn't touching AI. xAI, the company that develops racist Large Language Model "Grok" and owns what remains of Twitter, apparently burns $1 billion a month, and The Information reports that it makes a whopping $100 million in annualized revenue — so, about $8.33 million a month. There is a shareholder vote for Tesla to potentially invest in xAI, which will probably happen, allowing Musk to continue to pull leverage from his Tesla stock until the company's decaying sales and brand eventually swallow him whole. But we're not talking about Elon Musk today. Apple Intelligence radicalized millions of people against AI, mostly because it fucking stank. Apple clearly got into AI reluctantly, and now faces stories about how they "fell behind in the AI race," which mostly means that Apple aggressively introduced people to the features of generative AI by force, and it turns out that people don't really want to summarize documents, write emails, or make "custom emoji," and anyone who thinks they would is a fucking alien. In any case, Apple hasn't bet the farm on AI, insomuch as it hasn't spent two hundred billion dollars on infrastructure for a product with a limited market that only loses money. To be clear, I am not saying that any of the Magnificent 7 are going to die — just that five companies' spend on NVIDIA GPUs largely dictate how stable the US stock market will be. If any of these companies (but especially NVIDIA) sneeze, your 401k or your kid’s college fund will catch a cold. I realize this sounds a little simplistic, but by my calculations, NVIDIA's value underpins around 8% of the value of the US stock market. At the time of writing, it accounts for roughly 7.5% of the S&P 500 — an index of the 500 largest US publicly-traded companies. A disturbing 88% of Nvidia’s revenue comes from enterprise-scale GPUs primarily used for generative AI, of which five companies' spend makes up 42% of its revenue. In the event that any one of these companies makes significant changes to their investments in NVIDIA chips, it will eventually have a direct and meaningful negative impact on the wider market. NVIDIA's earnings are, effectively, the US stock market's confidence, and everything rides on five companies — and if we're honest, really four companies — buying GPUs for generative AI services or to train generative AI models. Worse still, these services, while losing these companies massive amounts of money, don't produce much revenue, meaning that the AI trade is not driving any real, meaningful revenue growth. Silence! Any of these companies talking about "growth from AI" or "the jobs that AI will replace" or "how AI has changed their organization" are hand-waving to avoid telling you how much money these services are actually making them. If they were making good money and experiencing real growth as a result of these services, they wouldn't shut the fuck up about it! They'd be in your ear and up your ass hooting about how much cash they were rolling in! And they're not, because they aren't rolling in cash, and are in fact blowing nearly a hundred billion dollars each to build massive, power-hungry, costly data centers for no real reason. Don’t watch the mouth — watch the hands. These companies are going to say they’re seeing growth from AI, but unless they actually show you the growth and enumerate it, they are hand-waving. So, one of the most annoying and consistent responses to my work is to say that either Amazon or Amazon Web Services “ran at a loss,” and that Amazon Web Services — the invention of modern cloud computing infrastructure — “lost money and then didn’t.” The thing is, this statement is one of those things that people say because it sounds rational. Amazon did lose money, and Amazon Web Services was expensive, that’s obvious, right? The thing is, I’ve never really had anyone explain this point to me, so I am finally going to sit down and deal with this criticism, because every single person who mentions it thinks they just pulled Excalibur from the stone and can now decapitate me. They claim that because people in the past doubted Amazon — because, or in addition to the burn rate of Amazon Web Services as the company built out its infrastructure — that I too am wrong, because they were wrong about that. This isn't Camelot, you rube! You are not King Arthur! I will address both the argument itself and the "they" part of it too — because if the argument is that the people that got AWS wrong should not be trusted, then we should no longer trust them, the people actively propagandizing our supposed generative AI future. Right? So, I'm honestly not sure where this argument came from, because there is, to my knowledge, no story about Amazon Web Services where somebody suggested its burnrate would kill Amazon. But let’s go back in time to the May 31 1999 piece that some might be thinking of, called "Amazon.bomb," and how writer Jacqueline Doherty was mocked soundly for "being wrong" about Amazon, which has now become quite profitable. I also want to be clear that Amazon Web Services didn't launch until 2006, and Amazon itself would become reliably profitable in 2003. Technically Amazon had opened up Amazon.com's web services for developers to incorporate its content into their applications in 2002, but what we consider AWS today — cloud storage and compute — launched in 2006. But okay, what did she actually say? Her argument, for the most part, is that Amazon was burning cash, had a ton of competition from other people doing similar things, and that analysts backed her up: Fair arguments for the time, though perhaps a little narrow-minded. The assumption wasn't that what Amazon was building was a bad idea, but that Amazon wouldn't be the ones to build it, with one saying: In simpler terms: Amazon's business model wasn't in question. People were buying shit online. In fact, this was just before the dot com bubble burst, and when optimism about the web was at a high point. Yet the comparison stops there — people obviously liked buying shit online, it was the business models of many of these companies — like WebVan — that sucked. Amazon Web Services was an outgrowth of Amazon's own infrastructure, which had to expand rapidly to deal with the influx of web traffic for Amazon.com, which had become one of the world's most popular websites and was becoming increasingly more-complex as it sold things other than books. Other companies had their own infrastructure, but if a smaller company wanted to scale, they’d basically need to build their own thing. It's actually pretty cool what Amazon did! Remember, this was the early 2000s, before Facebook, Twitter, and a lot of the modern internet we know that runs on services like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. It invented the modern concept of compute! But we're here to talk about Amazon Web Services being dangerous for Amazon and people hating on it. A November 2006 story from Bloomberg talked about Jeff Bezos' Risky Bet to "run your business with the technology behind his web site," saying that "Wall Street [wanted] him to mind the store." Bezos, referred to as a "one-time internet poster boy" that became "a post-dot-com piñata." Nevertheless, this article has what my haters crave: Pretty bad, right? My goose is cooked? All those analysts seem pretty mad! Except it's not, my goose is raw! Yours, however, has been in the oven for over a year! Emphasis mine: That's right — the ongoing costs aren't the problem. Hey wait a second, that's a name! I can look up a name! Scott W. Devitt now works at Wedbush as its managing director of equity research, and has said AI companies would enter a new stage in 2025...god, just read this: The analyst says the market will enter phase two in 2025, with software companies and cloud provider stocks expected to see gains. He adds that cybersecurity companies could also benefit as the technology evolves. Dewitt specifically calls out Palantir, Snowflake, and Salesforce as those who would "gain." In none of these cases am I able to see the actual revenue from AI, but Salesforce itself said that it will see no revenue growth from AI this year. Palantir also, as discovered by the Autonomy Institute’s recent study, recently added to the following to its public disclosures: What I'm saying is that analysts can be wrong! And they can be wrong at scale! There is no analyst consensus that agrees with me. In fact, most analysts appear to be bullish on AI, despite the significantly-worse costs and total lack of growth! Yet even in this Hater's Parade, the unnamed journalist makes a case for Amazon Web Services: Nice try, chuckles! In 2015, the year that Amazon Web Services became profitable, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty believed that it was running at a "material loss," suggesting that $5.5 billion of Amazon's "technology and content expenses" was actually AWS expenses, with a "negative contribution of $1.3 billion." Here is Katy Huberty, the analyst in question, declaring six months ago that "2025 [will] be the year of Agentic AI, robust enterprise adoption, and broadening AI winners." So, yes, analysts really got AWS wrong. But putting that aside, there might actually be a comparison here! Amazon Web Services absolutely created a capital expenditures drain on Amazon. From Forbes’s Chuck Jones: In today's money, this means that Amazon spent $6.76 billion in capital expenditures on AWS in 2014. Assuming it was this much every year — it wasn't, but I want to make an example of every person claiming that this is a gotcha — it took $67.6 billion and ten years (though one could argue it was nine) of pure capital expenditures to turn Amazon Web Services into a business that now makes billions of dollars a quarter in profit. That's $15.4 billion less than Amazon's capital expenditures for 2024, and less than one-fifteenth its projected capex spend for 2025. And to be clear, the actual capital expenditure numbers are likely much lower, but I want to make it clear that even when factoring in inflation, Amazon Web Services was A) a bargain and B) a fraction of the cost of what Amazon has spent in 2024 or 2025. Some people compare Large Language Models and their associated services to Amazon Web Services, or services like Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud, and they are wrong to do so. Amazon Web Services, when it launched, comprised of things like (and forgive how much I'm diluting this) Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), where you rent space on Amazon's servers to run applications in the cloud, or Amazon Simple Storage (S3), which is enterprise-level storage for applications. In simpler terms, if you were providing a cloud-based service, you used Amazon to both store the stuff that the service needed and the actual cloud-based processing (compute, so like your computer loads and runs applications but delivered to thousands or millions of people). This is a huge industry. Amazon Web Services alone brought in revenues of over $100 billion in 2024, and while Microsoft and Google don't break out their cloud revenues, they're similarly large parts of their revenue, and Microsoft has used Azure in the past to patch over shoddy growth. These services are also selling infrastructure. You aren't just paying for the compute, but the ability to access storage and deliver services with low latency — so users have a snappy experience — wherever they are in the world. The subtle magic of the internet is that it works at all, and a large part of that is the cloud compute infrastructure and oligopoly of the main providers having such vast data centers. This is much cheaper than doing it yourself, until a certain point. Dropbox moved away from Amazon Web Services as it scaled. It also allows someone else to take care of maintenance of the hardware and make sure it actually gets to your customers. You also don't have to worry about spikes in usage, because these things are usage-based, and you can always add more compute to meet demand. There is, of course, nuance — security-specific features, content-specific delivery services, database services — behind these clouds. You are buying into the infrastructure of the infrastructure provider, and the reason these products are so profitable is, in part, because you are handing off the problems and responsibility to somebody else. And based on that idea, there are multiple product categories you can build on top of it, because ultimately cloud services are about Amazon, Microsoft and Google running your infrastructure for you. Large Language Models and their associated services are completely different, despite these companies attempting to prove otherwise, and it starts with a very simple problem: why did any of these companies build these giant data centers and fill them full of GPUs? Amazon Web Services was created out of necessity — Amazon's infrastructure needs were so great that it effectively had to build both the software and hardware necessary to deliver a store that sold theoretically everything to theoretically anywhere, handling both the traffic from customers, delivering the software that runs Amazon.com quickly and reliably, and, well, making sure things ran in a stable way. It didn't need to come up with a reason for people to run web applications — they were already doing so themselves, but in ways that cost a lot, were inflexible, and required specialist skills. AWS took something that people already did, and what there was a proven demand for, and made it better. Eventually, Google and Microsoft would join the fray. And that appears to be the only similarity with generative AI — that due to the ridiculous costs of both the data centers and GPUs necessary to provide these services, it's largely impossible for others to even enter the market. Yet after that, generative AI feels more like a feature of cloud infrastructure rather than infrastructure itself. AWS and similar megaclouds are versatile, flexible and multifaceted. Generative AI does what generative AI does, and that's about it. You can run lots of different things on AWS. What are the different things you can run using Large Language Models? What are the different use cases, and, indeed, user requirements that make this the supposed "next big thing"? Perhaps the argument is that generative AI is the next AWS or similar cloud service because you can build the next great companies on the infrastructure of others — the models of, say, OpenAI and Anthropic, and the servers of Microsoft. So, okay, let's humour this point too. You can build the next great AI startup, and you have to build it on one of the megclouds because they're the only ones that can afford to build the infrastructure. One small problem. Let's start by establishing a few facts: None of this is to say that one hundred million dollars isn't a lot of money to you and me, but in the world of Software-as-Service or enterprise software, this is chump change. Hubspot had revenues of $2.63 billion in its 2024 financial year. We're three years in, and generative AI's highest-grossing companies — outside OpenAI ($10 billion annualized as of early June) and Anthropic ($4 billion annualized as of July), and both lose billions a year after revenue — have three major problems: But let's start with Anysphere and Cursor, its AI-powered coding app, and its $500 million of annualized revenue. Pretty great, right? It hit $200 million in annualized revenue in March, then hit $500 million annualized revenue in June after raising $900 million. That's amazing! Sadly, it's a mirage. Cursor's growth was a result of an unsustainable business model that it’s now had to replace with opaque terms of service, dramatically restricted access to models, and rate limits that effectively stop its users using the product at the price point they were used to. It’s also horribly unprofitable, and a sign of things to come for generative AI. A couple of weeks ago, I wrote up the dramatic changes that Cursor made to its service in the middle of June on my premium newsletter, and discovered that they timed precisely with Anthropic (and OpenAI to a lesser extent) adding "service tiers" and "priority processing," which is tech language for "pay us extra if you have a lot of customers or face rate limits or service delays." These price shifts have also led to companies like Replit having to make significant changes to its pricing model that disfavor users. I will now plagiarise myself: In simpler terms, Cursor raised $900 million and very likely had to hand large amounts of that money over to OpenAI and Anthropic to keep doing business with them, and then immediately changed its terms of service to make them worse. As I said at the time: Cursor is the largest and most-successful generative AI company, and these aggressive and desperate changes to its product suggest A) that its product is deeply unprofitable and B) that its current growth was a result of offering a product that was not the one it would sell in the long term. Cursor misled its customers, and its current revenue is, as a result, highly unlikely to stay at this level. Worse still, the two Anthropic engineers who left to join Cursor two weeks ago just returned to Anthropic. This heavily suggests that whatever they saw at Cursor wasn’t compelling enough to make them stay. As I also said: I realize it's likely a little boring hearing about software as a service, but this is the only place where generative AI can really make money. Companies buying hundreds or thousands of seats are how industries that rely upon compute grow, and without that growth, they're going nowhere. To give you some context, Netflix makes about $39 billion a year in subscription revenue, and Spotify about $18 billion. These are the single-most-popular consumer software subscriptions in the world — and OpenAI's 15.5 million subscribers suggest that it can't rely on them for the kind of growth that would actually make the company worth $300 billion (or more). Cursor is, as it stands, the one example of a company thriving using generative AI, and it appears its rapid growth was a result of selling a product at a massive loss. As it stands today, Cursor's product is significantly worse, and its Reddit is full of people furious at the company for the changes. In simpler terms, Cursor was the company that people mentioned to prove that startups could make money by building products on top of OpenAI and Anthropic's models, yet the truth is that the only way to do so and grow is to burn tons of money. While the tempting argument is to say that Cursor’s "customers are addicted," this is clearly not the case, nor is it a real business model. This story also showed that Anthropic and OpenAI are the biggest threats to their customers, and will actively rent-seek and punish their success stories, looking to loot as much as they can from them. To put it bluntly: Cursor's growth story was a lie. It reached $500 million in annualized revenue selling a product it can no longer afford to sell, suggesting material weakness in its own business and any and all coding startups. It is also remarkable — and a shocking failure of journalism — that this isn’t in every single article about Anysphere. I'm serious! Perplexity? Perplexity only has $150 million in annualized revenue! It spent 167% of its revenue in 2024 ($57m, its revenue was $34m) on compute services from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Amazon! It lost $68 million! And worse still, it has no path to profitability, and it’s not even anything new! It’s a search engine! Professional gasbag Alex Heath just did a flummoxing interview with Perplexity CEO Aravind Srivinas, who, when asked how it’d become profitable, appeared to experience a stroke: Aravind, do you smell toast? And don’t talk to me about “AI browsers,” I’m sorry, it’s not a business model. How are people going to make revenue on this, hm? What do these products actually do? Oh they can poorly automate accepting LinkedIn invites? It’s like God himself has personally blessed my computer. Big deal! In any case, it doesn't seem like you can really build a consumer AI startup that makes anything approaching a real company. Other than ChatGPT, I guess? Arguably the biggest sign that things are troubling in the generative AI space is that we use "annualized revenue" at all, which, as I've mentioned repeatedly, means multiplying a month by 12 and saying "that's our annualized!" The problem with this number is that, well, people cancel things. While your June might be great, if 10% of your subscribers churn in a bad month (due to a change in your terms of service), that's a chunk of your annualized revenue gone. But the worst sign is that nobody is saying the monthly figures, mostly because the monthly figures kinda suck! $100 million of annualized revenue is $8.33 million a month. To give you some scale, Amazon Web Services hit $189 million ($15.75 million a month) in revenue in 2008, two years after founding, and while it took until 2015 to hit profitability, it actually hit break-even in 2009, though it invested cash in growth for a few years after. Right now, not a single generative AI software company is profitable, and none of them are showing the signs of the kind of hypergrowth that previous "big" software companies had. While Cursor is technically "the fastest growing SaaS of all time," it did so using what amounts to fake pricing. You can dress this up as "growth stage" or "enshittification (it isn't by the way, generally price changes make things profitable, which this did not)," but Cursor lied. It lied to the public about what its product would do long-term. It isn't even obvious whether its current pricing is sustainable. Outside of Cursor, what other software startups are there? Glean? Everyone loves to talk about enterprise search company Glean — a company that uses AI to search and generate answers from your company's files and documents. In December 2024, Glean raised $260 million, proudly stating that it had over $550 million of cash in hand with "best-in-class ARR growth." A few months later in February 2025, Glean announced it’d "achieved $100 million in annual recurring revenue in fourth quarter FY25, cementing its position as one of the fastest-growing SaaS startups and reflecting a surging demand for AI-powered workplace intelligence." In this case, ARR could literally mean anything, as it appears to be based on quarters — meaning it could be an average of the last three months of the year, I guess? Anywho, in June 2025, Glean announced it had raised another funding round, this time raising $150 million, and, troublingly, added that since its last round, it had "...surpassed $100M in ARR." Five months into the fucking year and your monthly revenue is the same? That isn't good! That isn't good at all! Also, what happened to that $550 million in cash? Why did Glean need more? Hey wait a second, Glean announced its raise on June 18 2025, two days after Cursor's pricing increase and the same day that Replit announced a similar hike! It's almost as if its pricing dramatically increased due to the introduction of Anthropic's Service Tiers and OpenAI's Priority Processing. I'm guessing, but isn't it kind of weird that all of these companies raised money about the same time? Hey, that reminds me. If you look at what generative AI companies do (note that the following is not a quality barometer), it's probably doing one of the following things: Every single generative AI company that isn't OpenAI or Anthropic does one or a few of these things, and I mean every one of them, and it's because every single generative AI company uses Large Language Models, which have inherent limits on what they can do. LLMs can generate, they can search, they can edit (kind of!), they can transcribe (sometimes accurately!) and they can translate (often less accurately). As a result, it's very, very difficult for a company to build something unique. Though Cursor is successful, it is ultimately a series of system prompts, a custom model that its users hate, a user interface and connections to models by OpenAI and Anthropic, both of whom have competing products and make money from Cursor and its competitors. Within weeks of Cursor's changes to its services, Amazon and ByteDance released competitors that, for the most part, do the same thing. Sure there's a few differences in how they're designed, but design is not a moat, especially in a high-cost, negative-profit business, where your only way of growing is to offer a product you can't afford to sustain. The only other moat you can build..is the services you provide, which, when your services are dependent on a Large Language Model, are dependent on the model developer, who, in the case of OpenAI and Anthropic, could simply clone your startup, because the only valuable intellectual property is theirs. You may say "well, nobody else has any ideas either," to which I'll say that I fully agree. My Rot-Com Bubble thesis suggests we're out of hypergrowth ideas, and yeah, I think we're out of ideas related to Large Language Models too. At this point, I think it's fair to ask — are there any good companies you can build on top of Large Language Models? I don't mean add features related to, I mean an AI company that actually sells a product that people buy at scale that isn't called ChatGPT. In previous tech booms, companies would make their own “models” — their own infrastructure, or the things that make them distinct from other companies — but the generative AI boom effectively changes that by making everybody build stuff on top of somebody else’s models, because training your own models is both extremely expensive and requires vast amounts of infrastructure. As a result, much of this “boom” is about a few companies — really two, if we’re honest — getting other companies to try and build functional software for them. I wanted to add one note — that, ultimately, OpenAI and Anthropic are bad for their customers. Their models are popular (by which I mean their customers' customers will expect access to them) meaning that OpenAI and Anthropic can (as they did with Cursor) arbitrarily change pricing, service availability or functionality based on how they feel that day. Don't believe me? Anthropic cut off access to AI coding platform Windsurf because it looked like it might get acquired by OpenAI. Even by big tech standards this fucking sucks. And these companies will do it again! Because all Large Language Models require more data than anyone has ever needed, they all basically have to use the same data, either taken from the internet or bought from one of a few companies (Scale, Surge, Turing, Together, etc.). While they can get customized data or do customized training/reinforcement learning, these models are all transformer-based, and they all function similarly, and the only way to make them different is by training them, which doesn't make them much different, just better at things they already do. I already mentioned OpenAI and Anthropic's costs, as well as Perplexity's $50 million+ bill to Anthropic, Amazon and OpenAI off of a measly $34 million in revenue. These companies cost too much to run, and their functionality doesn't make enough money to make them make sense. The problem isn't just the pricing, but how unpredictable it is. As Matt Ashare wrote for CIO Dive last year, generative AI makes a lot of companies’ lives difficult through the massive spikes in costs that come from power users, with few ways to mitigate their costs. One of the ways that a company manages their cloud bills is by having some degree of predictability — which is difficult to do with the constant slew of new models and demands for new products to go with them, especially when said models can (and do) cost more with subsequent iterations. As a result, it's hard for AI companies to actually budget. "But Ed!" you cry, "What about AGENTS?" Let me tell you about agents. The term "agent" is one of the most egregious acts of fraud I've seen in my entire career writing about this crap, and that includes the metaverse. When you hear the word "agent," you are meant to think of an autonomous AI that can go and do stuff without oversight, replacing somebody's job in the process, and companies have been pushing the boundaries of good taste and financial crimes in pursuit of them. Most egregious of them is Salesforce's "Agentforce," which lets you "deploy AI agents at scale" and "brings digital labor to every employee, department and business process." This is a blatant fucking lie. Agentforce is a god damn chatbot platform, it's for launching chatbots, they can sometimes plug into APIs that allow them to access other information, but they are neither autonomous nor "agents" by any reasonable definition. Not only does Salesforce not actually sell "agents," its own research shows that agents only achieve around a 58% success rate on single-step tasks, meaning, to quote The Register, "tasks that can be completed in a single step without needing follow-up actions or more information." On multi-step tasks — so, you know, most tasks — they succeed a depressing 35% of the time. Last week, OpenAI announced its own "ChatGPT agent" that can allegedly go "do tasks" on a "virtual computer." In its own demo, the agent took 21 or so minutes to spit out a plan for a wedding with destinations, a vague calendar and some suit options, and then showed a pre-prepared demo of the "agent" preparing an itinerary of how to visit every major league ballpark. In this example's case, "agent" took 23 minutes, and produced arguably the most confusing-looking map I've seen in my life. It also missed out every single major league ballpark on the East Coast — including Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park — and added a random stadium in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. What team is that, eh Sam? The Deepwater Horizon Devils? Is there a baseball team in North Dakota? I should also be clear this was the pre-prepared example. As with every Large Language Model-based product — and yes, that's what this is, even if OpenAI won't talk about what model — results are extremely variable. Agents are difficult, because tasks are difficult, even if they can be completed by a human being that a CEO thinks is stupid. What OpenAI appears to be doing is using a virtual machine to run scripts that its models trigger. Regardless of how well it works (it works very very poorly and inconsistently), it's also likely very expensive. In any case, every single company you see using the word agent is trying to mislead you. Glean's "AI agents" are chatbots with if-this-then-that functions that trigger events using APIs (the connectors between different software services), not taking actual actions, because that is not what LLMs can do. ServiceNow's AI agents that allegedly "act autonomously and proactively on your behalf" are, despite claiming they "go beyond ‘better chatbots,’" still ultimately chatbots that use APIs to trigger different events using if-this-then-that functions. Sometimes these chatbots can also answer questions that people might have, or trigger an event somewhere. Oh, right, that's the same thing. The closest we have to an "agent" of any kind is a coding agent, which can make a list of things that you might do on a software project and then go and generate the code and push stuff to Github when you ask them to, and they can do so "autonomously," in the sense that you can let them just run whatever task seems right. When I say "ask them to" or "go and" I mean that these agents are not remotely intelligent, and when let run rampant fuck up everything and create a bunch of extra work. Also, a study found that AI coding tools made engineers 19% slower. Nevertheless, none of these products are autonomous agents, and anybody using the term agent likely means "chatbot." And it's working because the media keeps repeating everything these companies say. I realize we've taken kind of a scenic route here, but I needed to lay the groundwork here, because I am well and truly alarmed. According to a UBS report from the 26th of June, the public companies running AI services are making absolutely pathetic amounts of money from AI: ServiceNow's use of "$250 million ACV" — so annual contract value — may be one of the more honest explanations of revenue I've seen, putting them in the upper echelons of AI revenue unless, of course, you think for two seconds, whether these are AI-specific contracts. Or, perhaps, are they contracts including AI? Eh, who cares. It's also year-long agreements that could churn, and according to Gartner, over 40% of "agentic AI" projects will be canceled by end of 2027. And really, ya gotta laugh at Adobe and Salesforce, both of whom have talked so god damn much about generative AI and yet have only made around $100 million in annualized revenue from it. Pathetic! These aren't futuristic numbers! They're barely product categories! And none of this seems to include costs. Oh well. I haven't really spent time on my favourite subject — OpenAI being a systemic risk to the tech industry. To recap: Anthropic is in a similar, but slightly better position — it is set to lose $3 billion this year on $4 billion of revenue. It also has no path to profitability, recently jacked up prices on Cursor, its largest customer, and had to put restraints on Claude Code after allowing users to burn 100% to 10,000% of their revenue. These are the actions of a desperate company. Nevertheless, OpenAI and Anthropic's revenues amount to, by my estimates, more than half of the entire revenue of the generative AI industry, including the hyperscalers. To be abundantly clear: the two companies that amount to around half of all generative artificial intelligence revenue are ONLY LOSING MONEY. I've said a lot of this before, which is why I'm not harping on about it, but the most important company in the entire AI industry needs to convert by the end of the year or it's effectively dead, and even if it does, it burns billions and billions of dollars a year and will die without continual funding. It has no path to profitability, and anyone telling you otherwise is a liar or a fantasist. Worse still, outside of OpenAI...what is there, really? As I wrote earlier in the year, there is really no significant adoption of generative AI services or products. ChatGPT has 500 million weekly users, and otherwise, it seems that other services struggle to get 15 million of them. And while the 500 million weekly users sounds — and, in fairness, is — impressive, there’s a world of difference between someone using a product as part of their job, and someone dicking around with an image generator, or a college student trying to cheat on their homework. Sidebar: Google cheated by combining Google Gemini with Google Assistant to claim that it has 350 million users. Don't care, sorry. This is worrying on so many levels, chief of which is that everybody has been talking about AI for three god damn years, everybody has said "AI" in every earnings and media appearance and exhausting blog post, and we still can't scrape together the bits needed to make a functional industry. I know some of you will probably read this and point to ChatGPT's users, and I quote myself here: It has, allegedly, 500 million weekly active users — and, by the last count, only 15.5 million paying subscribers, an absolutely putrid conversion rate even before you realize that the actual conversion rate would be monthly active subscribers. That’s how any real software company actually defines its metrics, by the fucking way. Why is this impressive? Because it grew fast? It literally had more PR and more marketing and more attention and more opportunities to sell to more people than any company has ever had in the history of anything. Every single industry has been told to think about AI for three years, and they’ve been told to do so because of a company called OpenAI. There isn’t a single god damn product since Google or Facebook that has had this level of media pressure, and both of those companies launched without the massive amount of media (and social media) that we have today. ChatGPT is a very successful growth product and an absolutely horrifying business. OpenAI is a banana republic that cannot function on its own, it does not resemble Uber, Amazon Web Services, or any other business in the past other than WeWork, the other company that SoftBank spent way too much money on. And outside of ChatGPT, there really isn't anything else. Before I wrap up — I'm tired, and I imagine you are too — I want to address something. Yes, generative AI has functionality. There are coding products and search products that people like and pay for. As I have discussed above, none of these companies are profitable, and until one of them is profitable, generative AI-based companies are not real businesses. In any case, the problem isn't so much that LLMs "don't do anything," but that people talk about them doing things they can't do. I believe that the generative AI market is a $50 billion revenue industry masquerading as a $1 trillion one, and the media is helping. As I've explained at length, the AI trade is not one based on revenue, user growth, the efficacy of tools or significance of any technological breakthrough. Stocks are not moving based on whether they are making money on AI, because if they were, they'd be moving downward. However, due to the vibes-based nature of the AI trade, companies are benefiting from the press inexplicably crediting growth to AI with no proof that that's the case. OpenAI is a terrible business, and the only businesses worse than OpenAI are the companies built on top of it. Large Language Models are too expensive to run, and have limited abilities beyond the ones I've named previously, and because everybody is running models that all, on some level, do the same thing, it's very hard for people to build really innovative products on top of them. And, ultimately, this entire trade hinges on GPUs. CoreWeave was initially funded by NVIDIA, its IPO funded partially by NVIDIA, NVIDIA is one of its customers, and CoreWeave raises debt on the GPUs it buys from NVIDIA to build more data centers, while also using the money to buy GPUs from NVIDIA. This isn’t me being polemic or hysterical — this is quite literally what is happening, and how CoreWeave operates. If you aren’t alarmed by that, I’m not sure what to tell you. Elsewhere, Oracle is buying $40 billion in GPUs for the still-unformed Stargate data center project, and Meta is building a Manhattan-sized data center to fill with NVIDIA GPUs. OpenAI is Microsoft's largest Azure client — an insanely risky proposition on multiple levels, not simply in the fact that it’s serving the revenue at-cost but that Microsoft executives believed OpenAI would fail in the long term when they invested in 2023 — and Microsoft is NVIDIA's largest client for GPUs, meaning that any changes to Microsoft's future interest in OpenAI, such as reducing its data center expansion, would eventually hit NVIDIA's revenue. Why do you think DeepSeek shocked the market? It wasn't because of any clunky story around training techniques. It was because it said to the market that NVIDIA might not sell more GPUs every single quarter in perpetuity. Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple, Amazon and Tesla aren't making much money from AI — in fact, they're losing billions of dollars on whatever revenues they do make from it. Their stock growth is not coming from actual revenue, but the vibes around "being an AI company," which means absolutely jack shit when you don't have the users, finances, or products to back them up. So, really, everything comes down to NVIDIA's ability to sell GPUs, and this industry, if we're really honest, at this point only exists to do so. Generative AI products do not provide significant revenue growth, its products are not useful in the way that unlocks significant business value, and the products that have some adoption run at such a grotesque loss. I realize I've thrown a lot at you, and, for the second time this year, written the longest thing I've ever written. But I needed to write this, because I'm really worried. We're in a bubble. If you do not think we're in a bubble, you are not looking outside. Apollo Global Chief Economist Torsten Slok said it last week. Well, okay, what he said was much worse: We are in a bubble. Generative AI does not do the things that it's being sold as doing, and the things it can actually do aren't the kind of things that create business returns, automate labor, or really do much more than one extension of a cloud software platform. The money isn't there, the users aren't there, every company seems to lose money and some companies lose so much money that it's impossible to tell how they'll survive. Worse still, this bubble is entirely symbolic. The bailouts of the Great Financial Crisis were focused on banks and funds that had failed because they ran out of money, and the TARP initiative existed to plug the holes with low-interest loans. There are few holes to plug here, because even if OpenAI and Anthropic somehow became eternal money-burners, the AI trade exists based on the continued and continually-increasing sale and use of GPUs. There are limited amounts of capital, but also limited amounts of data centers to actually put GPUs, and on top of that, at some point growth will slow at one of the Magnificent 7, at which point costs will have to come down from things that lose them tons of money, such as generative AI. Before you ask- You do not have proof for this statement! The cost of tokens going down is not the same thing as the cost of inference goes down! Everyone saying this is saying it because a guy once said it to them! You don't have proof! I have more proof for what I am saying! While it theoretically might be, all evidence points to larger models costing more money, especially reasoning-heavy ones like Claude Opus 4. Inference is not the only thing happening, and if this is your one response, you are a big bozo and doofus and should go back to making squeaky noises when you see tech executives or hear my name. Okay, so one argument is that these companies will use ASICs — customized chips for specific operations — to reduce the amount they're spending. A few thoughts: I am worried because despite all of these obvious, brutal and near-unfixable problems, everybody is walking around acting like things are going great with AI. The New York Times claims everybody is using AI for everything — a blatant lie, one that exists to prop up an industry that has categorically failed to deliver the innovations or returns that it promised, yet still receives glowing press from a tech and business media that refuses to look outside and see that the sky is red and frogs are landing everywhere. Other than the frog thing, I'm not even being dramatic. Everywhere you look in the AI trade, things get worse — no revenue, billions being burned, no moat, no infrastructure play, no comparables in history other than the dot com bubble and WeWork, and a series of flagrant lies spouted by the powerful and members of the press that are afraid of moving against market consensus. Worse still, despite NVIDIA's strength, NVIDIA is the market's weakness, through no fault of its own, really. Jensen Huang sells GPUs, people want to buy GPUs, and now the rest of the market is leaning aggressively on one company, feeding it billions of dollars in the hopes that the things they're buying start making them a profit. And that really is the most ridiculous thing. At the center of the AI trade sits GPUs that, on installation, immediately start losing the company in question money. Large Language Models burn cash for negative returns to build products that all kind of work the same way. If you're going to say I'm wrong, sit and think carefully about why. Is it because you don't want me to be right? Is it because you think "these companies will work it out"? This isn't anything like Uber, AWS, or any other situation. It is its own monstrosity, a creature of hubris and ignorance caused by a tech industry that's run out of ideas, built on top of one company. You can plead with me all you want about how there are actual people using AI. You've probably read the "My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts" blog, and if you're gonna send it to me, read the response from Nik Suresh first. If you're going to say that I "don't speak to people who actually use these products," you are categorically wrong and in denial. I am only writing with this aggressive tone because, for the best part of two years, I have been made to repeatedly explain myself in a way that no AI "optimist" is made, and I admit I resent it. I have written hundreds of thousands of words with hundreds of citations, and still, to this day, there are people who claim I am somehow flawed in my analysis, that I'm missing something, that I am somehow failing to make my case. The only people failing to make their case are the AI optimists still claiming that these companies are making "powerful AI." And once this bubble pops, I will be asking for an apology. I love ending pieces with personal thoughts about stuff because I am an emotional and overly honest person, and I enjoy writing a lot. I do not, however, enjoy telling you at length how brittle everything is. An ideal tech industry would be one built on innovation, revenue, real growth based on actual business returns that helped humans be better, not outright lie about replacing them. All that generative AI has done is show how much lust there is in both the markets and the media for replacing human labor — and yes, it is in the media too. I truly believe there are multiple reporters who feel genuine excitement when they write scary stories about how Dario Amodei says white collar workers will be fired in the next few years in favour of "agents" that will never exist. Everything I’m discussing is the result of the Rot Economy thesis I wrote back in 2023 — the growth-at-all-costs mindset that has driven every tech company to focus on increasing quarterly revenue numbers, even if the products suck, or are deeply unprofitable, or, in the case of generative AI, both. Nowhere has there been a more pungent version of the Rot Economy than in Large Language Models, or more specifically GPUs. By making everything about growth, you inevitably reach a point where the only thing you know how to do is spend money, and both LLMs and GPUs allowed big tech to do the thing that worked before — building a bunch of data centers and buying a bunch of chips — without making sure they’d done the crucial work of “making sure this would create products people like.” As a result, we’re now sitting on top of one of the most brittle situations in economic history — our markets held up by whether four or five companies will continue to buy chips that start losing them money the second they’re installed. I am disgusted by how many people are unwilling or unable to engage with the truth, favouring instead a scornful, contemptuous tone toward anybody who doesn't believe that generative AI is the future. If you are a writer that writes about AI smarmily insulting people who "don't understand AI," you are a shitty fucking writer, because either AI isn't that good or you're not good at explaining why it's good. Perhaps it's both. If you want to know my true agenda, it's that I see something in generative AI and its boosters something I truly dislike. Large Language Models authoritatively state things that are incorrect because they have no concept of right or wrong. I believe that the writers, managers and executives that find it exciting do so because it gives them the ability to pretend to be intelligent without actually learning anything, to do everything they can to avoid actual work or responsibility for themselves or others. There is an overwhelming condescension that comes from fans of generative AI — the sense that they know something you don't, something they double down on. We are being forced to use it by bosses, or services we like that now insist it's part of our documents or our search engines, not because it does something, but because those pushing it need us to use it to prove that they know what's going on. To quote my editor Matt Hughes: "...generative AI...is an expression of contempt towards people, one that considers them to be a commodity at best, and a rapidly-depreciating asset at worst." I haven't quite cracked why, but generative AI also brings out the worst in some people. By giving the illusion of labor, it excites those who are desperate to replace or commoditize it. By giving the illusion of education, it excites those who are too idle to actually learn things by convincing them that in a few minutes they can learn quantum physics. By giving the illusion of activity, it allows the gluttony of Business Idiots that control everything to pretend that they do something. By giving the illusion of futurity, it gives reporters that have long-since disconnected from actual software and hardware the ability to pretend that they know what's happening in the tech industry. And, fundamentally, its biggest illusion is economic activity, because despite being questionably-useful and burning billions of dollars, its need to do so creates a justification for spending billions of dollars on GPUs and data center sprawl, which allows big tech to sink money into something and give the illusion of growth. I love writing, but I don't love writing this. I think I'm right, and it’s not something I’m necessarily happy about. If I'm wrong, I'll explain how I'm wrong in great detail, and not shy away from taking accountability, but I really do not think I am, and that's why I'm so alarmed. What I am describing is a bubble, and one with an obvious weakness: one company's ability to sell hardware to four or five other companies, all to run services that lose billions of dollars. At some point the momentum behind NVIDIA slows. Maybe it won't even be sales slowing — maybe it'll just be the suggestion that one of its largest customers won't be buying as many GPUs. Perception matters just as much as actual numbers, and sometimes more, and a shift in sentiment could start a chain of events that knocks down the entire house of cards. I don't know when, I don't know how, but I really, really don't know how I'm wrong. I hate that so many people will see their retirements wrecked, and that so many people intentionally or accidentally helped steer the market in this reckless, needless and wasteful direction, all because big tech didn’t have a new way to show quarterly growth. I hate that so many people have lost their jobs because companies are spending the equivalent of the entire GDP of some European countries on data centers and GPUs that won’t actually deliver any value. But my purpose here is to explain to you, no matter your background or interests or creed or whatever way you found my work, why it happened. As you watch this collapse, I want you to tell your friends about why — the people responsible and the decisions they made — and make sure it’s clear that there are people responsible. Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Andy Jassy have overseen a needless, wasteful and destructive economic force that will harm our markets (and by a larger extension our economy) and the tech industry writ large, and when this is over, they must be held accountable. And remember that you, as a regular person, can understand all of this. These people want you to believe this is black magic, that you are wrong to worry about the billions wasted or question the usefulness of these tools. You are smarter than they reckon and stronger than they know, and a better future is one where you recognize this, and realize that power and money doesn’t make a man righteous, right, or smart. I started writing this newsletter with 300 subscribers, and I now have 67,000 and a growing premium subscriber base. I am grateful for the time you’ve given me, and really hope that I continue to help you see the tech industry for what it currently is — captured almost entirely by people that have no interest in building the future.

Hey! Before we go any further — if you want to support my work, please sign up for the premium version of Where’s Your Ed At, it’s a $7-a-month (or $70-a-year) paid product where every week you get a premium newsletter, all while supporting my free work too. Also, subscribe to my podcast Better Offline, which is free. Go and subscribe then download every single episode. One last thing: This newsletter is nearly 14,500 words. It’s long. Perhaps consider making a pot of coffee before you start reading. Good journalism is making sure that history is actively captured and appropriately described and assessed, and it's accurate to describe things as they currently are as alarming. And I am alarmed. Alarm is not a state of weakness, or belligerence, or myopia. My concern does not dull my vision, even though it's convenient to frame it as somehow alarmist, like I have some hidden agenda or bias toward doom. I profoundly dislike the financial waste, the environmental destruction, and, fundamentally, I dislike the attempt to gaslight people into swearing fealty to a sickly and frail psuedo-industry where everybody but NVIDIA and consultancies lose money. I also dislike the fact that I, and others like me, are held to a remarkably different standard to those who paint themselves as "optimists," which typically means "people that agree with what the market wishes were true." Critics are continually badgered, prodded, poked, mocked, and jeered at for not automatically aligning with the idea that generative AI will be this massive industry, constantly having to prove themselves, as if somehow there's something malevolent or craven about criticism, that critics "do this for clicks" or "to be a contrarian." I don't do anything for clicks. I don't have any stocks or short positions. My agenda is simple: I like writing, it comes to me naturally, I have a podcast, and it is, on some level, my job to try and understand what the tech industry is doing on a day-to-day basis. It is easy to try and dismiss what I say as going against the grain because "AI is big," but I've been railing against bullshit bubbles since 2021 — the anti-remote work push (and the people behind it), the Clubhouse and audio social networks bubble, the NFT bubble, the made-up quiet quitting panic, and I even, though not as clearly as I wished, called that something was up with FTX several months before it imploded. This isn't "contrarianism." It's the kind of skepticism of power and capital that's necessary to meet these moments, and if it's necessary to dismiss my work because it makes you feel icky inside, get a therapist or see a priest. Nevertheless, I am alarmed, and while I have said some of these things separately, based on recent developments, I think it's necessary to say why. In short, I believe the AI bubble is deeply unstable, built on vibes and blind faith, and when I say "the AI bubble," I mean the entirety of the AI trade. And it's alarmingly simple, too. But this isn’t going to be saccharine, or whiny, or simply worrisome. I think at this point it’s become a little ridiculous to not see that we’re in a bubble. We’re in a god damn bubble, it is so obvious we’re in a bubble, it’s been so obvious we’re in a bubble, a bubble that seems strong but is actually very weak, with a central point of failure. I may not be a contrarian, but I am a hater. I hate the waste, the loss, the destruction, the theft, the damage to our planet and the sheer excitement that some executives and writers have that workers may be replaced by AI — and the bald-faced fucking lie that it’s happening, and that generative AI is capable of doing so. And so I present to you — the Hater’s Guide to the AI bubble, a comprehensive rundown of arguments I have against the current AI boom’s existence. Send it to your friends, your loved ones, or print it out and eat it. No, this isn’t gonna be a traditional guide, but something you can look at and say “oh that’s why the AI bubble is so bad.” And at this point, I know I’m tired of being gaslit by guys in gingham shirts who desperately want to curry favour with other guys in gingham shirts but who also have PHDs. I’m tired of reading people talk about how we’re “in the era of agents” that don’t fucking work and will never fucking work. I’m tired of hearing about “powerful AI” that is actually crap, and I’m tired of being told the future is here while having the world’s least-useful most-expensive cloud software shoved down my throat. Look, the generative AI boom is a mirage, it hasn’t got the revenue or the returns or the product efficacy for it to matter, everything you’re seeing is ridiculous and wasteful, and when it all goes tits up I want you to remember that I wrote this and tried to say something. As I write this, NVIDIA is currently sitting at $170 a share — a dramatic reversal of fate after the pummelling it took from the DeepSeek situation in January, which sent it tumbling to a brief late-April trip below $100 before things turned around. The Magnificent 7 stocks — NVIDIA, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), Apple, Meta, Tesla and Amazon — make up around 35% of the value of the US stock market, and of that, NVIDIA's market value makes up about 19% of the Magnificent 7. This dominance is also why ordinary people ought to be deeply concerned about the AI bubble. The Magnificent 7 is almost certainly a big part of their retirement plans, even if they’re not directly invested. Back in May, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reported that Microsoft (18.9%), Amazon (7.5%), Meta (9.3%), Alphabet (5.6%), and Tesla (0.9%) alone make up 42.4% of NVIDIA's revenue. The breakdown makes things worse. Meta spends 25% — and Microsoft an alarming 47% — of its capital expenditures on NVIDIA chips, and as Bratton notes, Microsoft also spends money renting servers from CoreWeave, which analyst Gil Luria of D.A.Davidson estimates accounted for $8 billion (more than 6%) of NVIDIA's revenue in 2024. Luria also estimates that neocloud companies like CoreWeave and Crusoe — that exist only to prove AI compute services — account for as much as 10% of NVIDIA's revenue. NVIDIA's climbing stock value comes from its continued revenue growth. In the last four quarters, NVIDIA has seen year-over-year growth of 101%, 94%, 78% and 69%, and, in the last quarter, a little statistic was carefully brushed under the rug: that NVIDIA missed, though narrowly, on data center revenue. This is exactly what it sounds like — GPUs that are used in servers, rather than gaming consoles and PCs (. Analysts estimated it would make $39.4 billion from this category, and NVIDIA only (lol) brought in $39.1 billion. Then again, it could be attributed to its problems in China, especially as the H20 ban has only just been lifted. In any case, it was a miss! NVIDIA's quarter-over-quarter growth has also become aggressively normal — from 69%, to 59%, to 12%, to 12% again each quarter, which, again, isn't bad (it's pretty great!), but when 88% of your revenue is based on one particular line in your earnings, it's a pretty big concern, at least for me. Look, I'm not a stock analyst, nor am I pretending to be one, so I am keeping this simple: In simpler terms, 35% of the US stock market is held up by five or six companies buying GPUs. If NVIDIA's growth story stumbles, it will reverberate through the rest of the Magnificent 7, making them rely on their own AI trade stories. And, as you will shortly find out, there is no AI trade, because generative AI is not making anybody any money. I'm so tired of people telling me that companies are "making tons of money on AI." Nobody is making a profit on generative AI other than NVIDIA. No, really, I’m serious. If they keep their promises, by the end of 2025, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Tesla will have spent over $560 billion in capital expenditures on AI in the last two years, all to make around $35 billion. This is egregiously fucking stupid. As of January 2025, Microsoft's "annualized" — meaning [best month]x12 — revenue from artificial intelligence was around $13 billion, a number that it chose not to update in its last earnings, likely because it's either flat or not growing, though it could in its upcoming late-July earnings. Yet the problem with this revenue is that $10 billion of that revenue, according to The Information, comes from OpenAI's spend on Microsoft's Azure cloud, and Microsoft offers preferential pricing — "a heavily discounted rental rate that essentially only covers Microsoft's costs for operating the servers" according to The Information. In simpler terms, 76.9% of Microsoft's AI revenue comes from OpenAI, and is sold at just above or at cost, making Microsoft's "real" AI revenue about $3 billion, or around 3.75% of this year's capital expenditures, or 16.25% if you count OpenAI's revenue, which costs Microsoft more money than it earns. The Information reports that Microsoft made $4.7 billion in "AI revenue" in 2024, of which OpenAI accounted for $2 billion, meaning that for the $135.7 billion that Microsoft has spent in the last two years on AI infrastructure, it has made $17.7 billion, of which OpenAI accounted for $12.7 billion. Things do not improve elsewhere. An analyst estimates that Amazon, which plans to spend $105 billion in capital expenditures this year, will make $5 billion on AI in 2025, rising, and I quote, "as much as 80%," suggesting that Amazon may have made a measly $2.77 billion in 2024 on AI in a year when it spent $83 billion in capital expenditures. [editor's note: this piece originally said "$1 billion" instead of "$2.77 billion" due to a math error, sorry!] Last year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that “AI represents for sure the biggest opportunity since cloud and probably the biggest technology shift and opportunity in business since the internet." I think he's full of shit. Bank of America analyst Justin Post estimated a few weeks ago that Google's AI revenue would be in the region of $7.7 billion, though his math is, if I'm honest, a little generous: Google's "One" subscription includes increased cloud storage across Google Drive, Gmail and Google Photos, and added a $20-a-month "premium" plan in February 2024 that included access to Google's various AI models. Google has claimed that the "premium AI tier accounts for millions" of the 150 million subscribers to the service, though how many millions is impossible to estimate — but that won't stop me trying! Assuming that $3.1 billion in 2025 revenue would work out to $258 million a month, that would mean there were 12.9 million Google One subscribers also paying for the premium AI tier. This isn't out of the realm of possibility — after all, OpenAI has 15.5 million paying subscribers — but Post is making a generous assumption here. Nevertheless, we'll accept the numbers as they are. And the numbers fuckin' stink! Google's $1.1 billion in workspace service revenue came from a forced price-hike on those who use Google services to run their businesses, meaning that this is likely not a number that can significantly increase without punishing them further. $7.7 billion of revenue — not profit! — on $75 billion of capital expenditures. Nasty! Someone's gonna get mad at me for saying this, but I believe that Meta is simply burning cash on generative AI. There is no product that Meta sells that monetizes Large Language Models, but every Meta product now has them shoved into them, such as your Instagram DMs oinking at you to generate artwork based on your conversation. Nevertheless, we do have some sort of knowledge of what Meta is saying due to the copyright infringement case Kadrey v. Meta. Unsealed judgment briefs revealed in April that Meta is claiming that "GenAI-driven revenue will be more than $2 billion," with estimates as high as $3 billion. The same document also claims that Meta expects to make $460 billion to $1.4 trillion in total revenue through 2035, the kind of thing that should get you fired in an iron ball into the sun. Meta makes 99% of its revenue from advertising, and the unsealed documents state that it "[generates] revenue from [its] Llama models and will continue earning revenue from each iteration," and "share a percentage of the revenue that [it generates] from users of the Llama models...hosted by those companies," with the companies in question redacted. Max Zeff of TechCrunch adds that Meta lists host partners like AWS, NVIDIA, Databricks, Groq, Dell, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Snowflake, so it's possible that Meta makes money from licensing to those companies. Sadly, the exhibits further discussing these numbers are filed under seal. Either way, we are now at $332 billion of capital expenditures in 2025 for $28.7 billion of revenue, of which $10 billion is OpenAI's "at-cost or just above cost" revenue. Not great. Despite its prominence in the magnificent 7, Tesla is one of the least-exposed of the magnificent 7 to the AI trade, as Elon Musk has turned it into a meme stock company. That doesn't mean, of course, that Musk isn't touching AI. xAI, the company that develops racist Large Language Model "Grok" and owns what remains of Twitter, apparently burns $1 billion a month, and The Information reports that it makes a whopping $100 million in annualized revenue — so, about $8.33 million a month. There is a shareholder vote for Tesla to potentially invest in xAI, which will probably happen, allowing Musk to continue to pull leverage from his Tesla stock until the company's decaying sales and brand eventually swallow him whole. But we're not talking about Elon Musk today. Apple Intelligence radicalized millions of people against AI, mostly because it fucking stank. Apple clearly got into AI reluctantly, and now faces stories about how they "fell behind in the AI race," which mostly means that Apple aggressively introduced people to the features of generative AI by force, and it turns out that people don't really want to summarize documents, write emails, or make "custom emoji," and anyone who thinks they would is a fucking alien. In any case, Apple hasn't bet the farm on AI, insomuch as it hasn't spent two hundred billion dollars on infrastructure for a product with a limited market that only loses money. To be clear, I am not saying that any of the Magnificent 7 are going to die — just that five companies' spend on NVIDIA GPUs largely dictate how stable the US stock market will be. If any of these companies (but especially NVIDIA) sneeze, your 401k or your kid’s college fund will catch a cold. I realize this sounds a little simplistic, but by my calculations, NVIDIA's value underpins around 8% of the value of the US stock market. At the time of writing, it accounts for roughly 7.5% of the S&P 500 — an index of the 500 largest US publicly-traded companies. A disturbing 88% of Nvidia’s revenue comes from enterprise-scale GPUs primarily used for generative AI, of which five companies' spend makes up 42% of its revenue. In the event that any one of these companies makes significant changes to their investments in NVIDIA chips, it will eventually have a direct and meaningful negative impact on the wider market. NVIDIA's earnings are, effectively, the US stock market's confidence, and everything rides on five companies — and if we're honest, really four companies — buying GPUs for generative AI services or to train generative AI models. Worse still, these services, while losing these companies massive amounts of money, don't produce much revenue, meaning that the AI trade is not driving any real, meaningful revenue growth. Silence! Any of these companies talking about "growth from AI" or "the jobs that AI will replace" or "how AI has changed their organization" are hand-waving to avoid telling you how much money these services are actually making them. If they were making good money and experiencing real growth as a result of these services, they wouldn't shut the fuck up about it! They'd be in your ear and up your ass hooting about how much cash they were rolling in! And they're not, because they aren't rolling in cash, and are in fact blowing nearly a hundred billion dollars each to build massive, power-hungry, costly data centers for no real reason. Don’t watch the mouth — watch the hands. These companies are going to say they’re seeing growth from AI, but unless they actually show you the growth and enumerate it, they are hand-waving. So, one of the most annoying and consistent responses to my work is to say that either Amazon or Amazon Web Services “ran at a loss,” and that Amazon Web Services — the invention of modern cloud computing infrastructure — “lost money and then didn’t.” The thing is, this statement is one of those things that people say because it sounds rational. Amazon did lose money, and Amazon Web Services was expensive, that’s obvious, right? The thing is, I’ve never really had anyone explain this point to me, so I am finally going to sit down and deal with this criticism, because every single person who mentions it thinks they just pulled Excalibur from the stone and can now decapitate me. They claim that because people in the past doubted Amazon — because, or in addition to the burn rate of Amazon Web Services as the company built out its infrastructure — that I too am wrong, because they were wrong about that. This isn't Camelot, you rube! You are not King Arthur! I will address both the argument itself and the "they" part of it too — because if the argument is that the people that got AWS wrong should not be trusted, then we should no longer trust them, the people actively propagandizing our supposed generative AI future. Right? So, I'm honestly not sure where this argument came from, because there is, to my knowledge, no story about Amazon Web Services where somebody suggested its burnrate would kill Amazon. But let’s go back in time to the May 31 1999 piece that some might be thinking of, called "Amazon.bomb," and how writer Jacqueline Doherty was mocked soundly for "being wrong" about Amazon, which has now become quite profitable. I also want to be clear that Amazon Web Services didn't launch until 2006, and Amazon itself would become reliably profitable in 2003. Technically Amazon had opened up Amazon.com's web services for developers to incorporate its content into their applications in 2002, but what we consider AWS today — cloud storage and compute — launched in 2006. But okay, what did she actually say? Her argument, for the most part, is that Amazon was burning cash, had a ton of competition from other people doing similar things, and that analysts backed her up: Fair arguments for the time, though perhaps a little narrow-minded. The assumption wasn't that what Amazon was building was a bad idea, but that Amazon wouldn't be the ones to build it, with one saying: In simpler terms: Amazon's business model wasn't in question. People were buying shit online. In fact, this was just before the dot com bubble burst, and when optimism about the web was at a high point. Yet the comparison stops there — people obviously liked buying shit online, it was the business models of many of these companies — like WebVan — that sucked. Amazon Web Services was an outgrowth of Amazon's own infrastructure, which had to expand rapidly to deal with the influx of web traffic for Amazon.com, which had become one of the world's most popular websites and was becoming increasingly more-complex as it sold things other than books. Other companies had their own infrastructure, but if a smaller company wanted to scale, they’d basically need to build their own thing. It's actually pretty cool what Amazon did! Remember, this was the early 2000s, before Facebook, Twitter, and a lot of the modern internet we know that runs on services like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. It invented the modern concept of compute! But we're here to talk about Amazon Web Services being dangerous for Amazon and people hating on it. A November 2006 story from Bloomberg talked about Jeff Bezos' Risky Bet to "run your business with the technology behind his web site," saying that "Wall Street [wanted] him to mind the store." Bezos, referred to as a "one-time internet poster boy" that became "a post-dot-com piñata." Nevertheless, this article has what my haters crave: Pretty bad, right? My goose is cooked? All those analysts seem pretty mad! Except it's not, my goose is raw! Yours, however, has been in the oven for over a year! Emphasis mine: That's right — the ongoing costs aren't the problem. Hey wait a second, that's a name! I can look up a name! Scott W. Devitt now works at Wedbush as its managing director of equity research, and has said AI companies would enter a new stage in 2025...god, just read this: The analyst says the market will enter phase two in 2025, with software companies and cloud provider stocks expected to see gains. He adds that cybersecurity companies could also benefit as the technology evolves. Dewitt specifically calls out Palantir, Snowflake, and Salesforce as those who would "gain." In none of these cases am I able to see the actual revenue from AI, but Salesforce itself said that it will see no revenue growth from AI this year. Palantir also, as discovered by the Autonomy Institute’s recent study, recently added to the following to its public disclosures: What I'm saying is that analysts can be wrong! And they can be wrong at scale! There is no analyst consensus that agrees with me. In fact, most analysts appear to be bullish on AI, despite the significantly-worse costs and total lack of growth! Yet even in this Hater's Parade, the unnamed journalist makes a case for Amazon Web Services: Nice try, chuckles! In 2015, the year that Amazon Web Services became profitable, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty believed that it was running at a "material loss," suggesting that $5.5 billion of Amazon's "technology and content expenses" was actually AWS expenses, with a "negative contribution of $1.3 billion." Here is Katy Huberty, the analyst in question, declaring six months ago that "2025 [will] be the year of Agentic AI, robust enterprise adoption, and broadening AI winners." So, yes, analysts really got AWS wrong. But putting that aside, there might actually be a comparison here! Amazon Web Services absolutely created a capital expenditures drain on Amazon. From Forbes’s Chuck Jones: In today's money, this means that Amazon spent $6.76 billion in capital expenditures on AWS in 2014. Assuming it was this much every year — it wasn't, but I want to make an example of every person claiming that this is a gotcha — it took $67.6 billion and ten years (though one could argue it was nine) of pure capital expenditures to turn Amazon Web Services into a business that now makes billions of dollars a quarter in profit. That's $15.4 billion less than Amazon's capital expenditures for 2024, and less than one-fifteenth its projected capex spend for 2025. And to be clear, the actual capital expenditure numbers are likely much lower, but I want to make it clear that even when factoring in inflation, Amazon Web Services was A) a bargain and B) a fraction of the cost of what Amazon has spent in 2024 or 2025. Some people compare Large Language Models and their associated services to Amazon Web Services, or services like Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud, and they are wrong to do so. Amazon Web Services, when it launched, comprised of things like (and forgive how much I'm diluting this) Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), where you rent space on Amazon's servers to run applications in the cloud, or Amazon Simple Storage (S3), which is enterprise-level storage for applications. In simpler terms, if you were providing a cloud-based service, you used Amazon to both store the stuff that the service needed and the actual cloud-based processing (compute, so like your computer loads and runs applications but delivered to thousands or millions of people). This is a huge industry. Amazon Web Services alone brought in revenues of over $100 billion in 2024, and while Microsoft and Google don't break out their cloud revenues, they're similarly large parts of their revenue, and Microsoft has used Azure in the past to patch over shoddy growth. These services are also selling infrastructure. You aren't just paying for the compute, but the ability to access storage and deliver services with low latency — so users have a snappy experience — wherever they are in the world. The subtle magic of the internet is that it works at all, and a large part of that is the cloud compute infrastructure and oligopoly of the main providers having such vast data centers. This is much cheaper than doing it yourself, until a certain point. Dropbox moved away from Amazon Web Services as it scaled. It also allows someone else to take care of maintenance of the hardware and make sure it actually gets to your customers. You also don't have to worry about spikes in usage, because these things are usage-based, and you can always add more compute to meet demand. There is, of course, nuance — security-specific features, content-specific delivery services, database services — behind these clouds. You are buying into the infrastructure of the infrastructure provider, and the reason these products are so profitable is, in part, because you are handing off the problems and responsibility to somebody else. And based on that idea, there are multiple product categories you can build on top of it, because ultimately cloud services are about Amazon, Microsoft and Google running your infrastructure for you. Large Language Models and their associated services are completely different, despite these companies attempting to prove otherwise, and it starts with a very simple problem: why did any of these companies build these giant data centers and fill them full of GPUs? Amazon Web Services was created out of necessity — Amazon's infrastructure needs were so great that it effectively had to build both the software and hardware necessary to deliver a store that sold theoretically everything to theoretically anywhere, handling both the traffic from customers, delivering the software that runs Amazon.com quickly and reliably, and, well, making sure things ran in a stable way. It didn't need to come up with a reason for people to run web applications — they were already doing so themselves, but in ways that cost a lot, were inflexible, and required specialist skills. AWS took something that people already did, and what there was a proven demand for, and made it better. Eventually, Google and Microsoft would join the fray. And that appears to be the only similarity with generative AI — that due to the ridiculous costs of both the data centers and GPUs necessary to provide these services, it's largely impossible for others to even enter the market. Yet after that, generative AI feels more like a feature of cloud infrastructure rather than infrastructure itself. AWS and similar megaclouds are versatile, flexible and multifaceted. Generative AI does what generative AI does, and that's about it. You can run lots of different things on AWS. What are the different things you can run using Large Language Models? What are the different use cases, and, indeed, user requirements that make this the supposed "next big thing"? Perhaps the argument is that generative AI is the next AWS or similar cloud service because you can build the next great companies on the infrastructure of others — the models of, say, OpenAI and Anthropic, and the servers of Microsoft. So, okay, let's humour this point too. You can build the next great AI startup, and you have to build it on one of the megclouds because they're the only ones that can afford to build the infrastructure. One small problem. Let's start by establishing a few facts: None of this is to say that one hundred million dollars isn't a lot of money to you and me, but in the world of Software-as-Service or enterprise software, this is chump change. Hubspot had revenues of $2.63 billion in its 2024 financial year. We're three years in, and generative AI's highest-grossing companies — outside OpenAI ($10 billion annualized as of early June) and Anthropic ($4 billion annualized as of July), and both lose billions a year after revenue — have three major problems: But let's start with Anysphere and Cursor, its AI-powered coding app, and its $500 million of annualized revenue. Pretty great, right? It hit $200 million in annualized revenue in March, then hit $500 million annualized revenue in June after raising $900 million. That's amazing! Sadly, it's a mirage. Cursor's growth was a result of an unsustainable business model that it’s now had to replace with opaque terms of service, dramatically restricted access to models, and rate limits that effectively stop its users using the product at the price point they were used to. It’s also horribly unprofitable, and a sign of things to come for generative AI. A couple of weeks ago, I wrote up the dramatic changes that Cursor made to its service in the middle of June on my premium newsletter, and discovered that they timed precisely with Anthropic (and OpenAI to a lesser extent) adding "service tiers" and "priority processing," which is tech language for "pay us extra if you have a lot of customers or face rate limits or service delays." These price shifts have also led to companies like Replit having to make significant changes to its pricing model that disfavor users. I will now plagiarise myself: In simpler terms, Cursor raised $900 million and very likely had to hand large amounts of that money over to OpenAI and Anthropic to keep doing business with them, and then immediately changed its terms of service to make them worse. As I said at the time: Cursor is the largest and most-successful generative AI company, and these aggressive and desperate changes to its product suggest A) that its product is deeply unprofitable and B) that its current growth was a result of offering a product that was not the one it would sell in the long term. Cursor misled its customers, and its current revenue is, as a result, highly unlikely to stay at this level. Worse still, the two Anthropic engineers who left to join Cursor two weeks ago just returned to Anthropic. This heavily suggests that whatever they saw at Cursor wasn’t compelling enough to make them stay. As I also said: I realize it's likely a little boring hearing about software as a service, but this is the only place where generative AI can really make money. Companies buying hundreds or thousands of seats are how industries that rely upon compute grow, and without that growth, they're going nowhere. To give you some context, Netflix makes about $39 billion a year in subscription revenue, and Spotify about $18 billion. These are the single-most-popular consumer software subscriptions in the world — and OpenAI's 15.5 million subscribers suggest that it can't rely on them for the kind of growth that would actually make the company worth $300 billion (or more). Cursor is, as it stands, the one example of a company thriving using generative AI, and it appears its rapid growth was a result of selling a product at a massive loss. As it stands today, Cursor's product is significantly worse, and its Reddit is full of people furious at the company for the changes. In simpler terms, Cursor was the company that people mentioned to prove that startups could make money by building products on top of OpenAI and Anthropic's models, yet the truth is that the only way to do so and grow is to burn tons of money. While the tempting argument is to say that Cursor’s "customers are addicted," this is clearly not the case, nor is it a real business model. This story also showed that Anthropic and OpenAI are the biggest threats to their customers, and will actively rent-seek and punish their success stories, looking to loot as much as they can from them. To put it bluntly: Cursor's growth story was a lie. It reached $500 million in annualized revenue selling a product it can no longer afford to sell, suggesting material weakness in its own business and any and all coding startups. It is also remarkable — and a shocking failure of journalism — that this isn’t in every single article about Anysphere. I'm serious! Perplexity? Perplexity only has $150 million in annualized revenue! It spent 167% of its revenue in 2024 ($57m, its revenue was $34m) on compute services from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Amazon! It lost $68 million! And worse still, it has no path to profitability, and it’s not even anything new! It’s a search engine! Professional gasbag Alex Heath just did a flummoxing interview with Perplexity CEO Aravind Srivinas, who, when asked how it’d become profitable, appeared to experience a stroke: Aravind, do you smell toast? And don’t talk to me about “AI browsers,” I’m sorry, it’s not a business model. How are people going to make revenue on this, hm? What do these products actually do? Oh they can poorly automate accepting LinkedIn invites? It’s like God himself has personally blessed my computer. Big deal! In any case, it doesn't seem like you can really build a consumer AI startup that makes anything approaching a real company. Other than ChatGPT, I guess? Arguably the biggest sign that things are troubling in the generative AI space is that we use "annualized revenue" at all, which, as I've mentioned repeatedly, means multiplying a month by 12 and saying "that's our annualized!" The problem with this number is that, well, people cancel things. While your June might be great, if 10% of your subscribers churn in a bad month (due to a change in your terms of service), that's a chunk of your annualized revenue gone. But the worst sign is that nobody is saying the monthly figures, mostly because the monthly figures kinda suck! $100 million of annualized revenue is $8.33 million a month. To give you some scale, Amazon Web Services hit $189 million ($15.75 million a month) in revenue in 2008, two years after founding, and while it took until 2015 to hit profitability, it actually hit break-even in 2009, though it invested cash in growth for a few years after. Right now, not a single generative AI software company is profitable, and none of them are showing the signs of the kind of hypergrowth that previous "big" software companies had. While Cursor is technically "the fastest growing SaaS of all time," it did so using what amounts to fake pricing. You can dress this up as "growth stage" or "enshittification (it isn't by the way, generally price changes make things profitable, which this did not)," but Cursor lied. It lied to the public about what its product would do long-term. It isn't even obvious whether its current pricing is sustainable. Outside of Cursor, what other software startups are there? Glean? Everyone loves to talk about enterprise search company Glean — a company that uses AI to search and generate answers from your company's files and documents. In December 2024, Glean raised $260 million, proudly stating that it had over $550 million of cash in hand with "best-in-class ARR growth." A few months later in February 2025, Glean announced it’d "achieved $100 million in annual recurring revenue in fourth quarter FY25, cementing its position as one of the fastest-growing SaaS startups and reflecting a surging demand for AI-powered workplace intelligence." In this case, ARR could literally mean anything, as it appears to be based on quarters — meaning it could be an average of the last three months of the year, I guess? Anywho, in June 2025, Glean announced it had raised another funding round, this time raising $150 million, and, troublingly, added that since its last round, it had "...surpassed $100M in ARR." Five months into the fucking year and your monthly revenue is the same? That isn't good! That isn't good at all! Also, what happened to that $550 million in cash? Why did Glean need more? Hey wait a second, Glean announced its raise on June 18 2025, two days after Cursor's pricing increase and the same day that Replit announced a similar hike! It's almost as if its pricing dramatically increased due to the introduction of Anthropic's Service Tiers and OpenAI's Priority Processing. I'm guessing, but isn't it kind of weird that all of these companies raised money about the same time? Hey, that reminds me. If you look at what generative AI companies do (note that the following is not a quality barometer), it's probably doing one of the following things: Every single generative AI company that isn't OpenAI or Anthropic does one or a few of these things, and I mean every one of them, and it's because every single generative AI company uses Large Language Models, which have inherent limits on what they can do. LLMs can generate, they can search, they can edit (kind of!), they can transcribe (sometimes accurately!) and they can translate (often less accurately). As a result, it's very, very difficult for a company to build something unique. Though Cursor is successful, it is ultimately a series of system prompts, a custom model that its users hate, a user interface and connections to models by OpenAI and Anthropic, both of whom have competing products and make money from Cursor and its competitors. Within weeks of Cursor's changes to its services, Amazon and ByteDance released competitors that, for the most part, do the same thing. Sure there's a few differences in how they're designed, but design is not a moat, especially in a high-cost, negative-profit business, where your only way of growing is to offer a product you can't afford to sustain. The only other moat you can build..is the services you provide, which, when your services are dependent on a Large Language Model, are dependent on the model developer, who, in the case of OpenAI and Anthropic, could simply clone your startup, because the only valuable intellectual property is theirs. You may say "well, nobody else has any ideas either," to which I'll say that I fully agree. My Rot-Com Bubble thesis suggests we're out of hypergrowth ideas, and yeah, I think we're out of ideas related to Large Language Models too. At this point, I think it's fair to ask — are there any good companies you can build on top of Large Language Models? I don't mean add features related to, I mean an AI company that actually sells a product that people buy at scale that isn't called ChatGPT. In previous tech booms, companies would make their own “models” — their own infrastructure, or the things that make them distinct from other companies — but the generative AI boom effectively changes that by making everybody build stuff on top of somebody else’s models, because training your own models is both extremely expensive and requires vast amounts of infrastructure. As a result, much of this “boom” is about a few companies — really two, if we’re honest — getting other companies to try and build functional software for them. I wanted to add one note — that, ultimately, OpenAI and Anthropic are bad for their customers. Their models are popular (by which I mean their customers' customers will expect access to them) meaning that OpenAI and Anthropic can (as they did with Cursor) arbitrarily change pricing, service availability or functionality based on how they feel that day. Don't believe me? Anthropic cut off access to AI coding platform Windsurf because it looked like it might get acquired by OpenAI. Even by big tech standards this fucking sucks. And these companies will do it again! Because all Large Language Models require more data than anyone has ever needed, they all basically have to use the same data, either taken from the internet or bought from one of a few companies (Scale, Surge, Turing, Together, etc.). While they can get customized data or do customized training/reinforcement learning, these models are all transformer-based, and they all function similarly, and the only way to make them different is by training them, which doesn't make them much different, just better at things they already do. I already mentioned OpenAI and Anthropic's costs, as well as Perplexity's $50 million+ bill to Anthropic, Amazon and OpenAI off of a measly $34 million in revenue. These companies cost too much to run, and their functionality doesn't make enough money to make them make sense. The problem isn't just the pricing, but how unpredictable it is. As Matt Ashare wrote for CIO Dive last year, generative AI makes a lot of companies’ lives difficult through the massive spikes in costs that come from power users, with few ways to mitigate their costs. One of the ways that a company manages their cloud bills is by having some degree of predictability — which is difficult to do with the constant slew of new models and demands for new products to go with them, especially when said models can (and do) cost more with subsequent iterations. As a result, it's hard for AI companies to actually budget. "But Ed!" you cry, "What about AGENTS?" Let me tell you about agents. The term "agent" is one of the most egregious acts of fraud I've seen in my entire career writing about this crap, and that includes the metaverse. When you hear the word "agent," you are meant to think of an autonomous AI that can go and do stuff without oversight, replacing somebody's job in the process, and companies have been pushing the boundaries of good taste and financial crimes in pursuit of them. Most egregious of them is Salesforce's "Agentforce," which lets you "deploy AI agents at scale" and "brings digital labor to every employee, department and business process." This is a blatant fucking lie. Agentforce is a god damn chatbot platform, it's for launching chatbots, they can sometimes plug into APIs that allow them to access other information, but they are neither autonomous nor "agents" by any reasonable definition. Not only does Salesforce not actually sell "agents," its own research shows that agents only achieve around a 58% success rate on single-step tasks, meaning, to quote The Register, "tasks that can be completed in a single step without needing follow-up actions or more information." On multi-step tasks — so, you know, most tasks — they succeed a depressing 35% of the time. Last week, OpenAI announced its own "ChatGPT agent" that can allegedly go "do tasks" on a "virtual computer." In its own demo, the agent took 21 or so minutes to spit out a plan for a wedding with destinations, a vague calendar and some suit options, and then showed a pre-prepared demo of the "agent" preparing an itinerary of how to visit every major league ballpark. In this example's case, "agent" took 23 minutes, and produced arguably the most confusing-looking map I've seen in my life. It also missed out every single major league ballpark on the East Coast — including Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park — and added a random stadium in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. What team is that, eh Sam? The Deepwater Horizon Devils? Is there a baseball team in North Dakota? I should also be clear this was the pre-prepared example. As with every Large Language Model-based product — and yes, that's what this is, even if OpenAI won't talk about what model — results are extremely variable. Agents are difficult, because tasks are difficult, even if they can be completed by a human being that a CEO thinks is stupid. What OpenAI appears to be doing is using a virtual machine to run scripts that its models trigger. Regardless of how well it works (it works very very poorly and inconsistently), it's also likely very expensive. In any case, every single company you see using the word agent is trying to mislead you. Glean's "AI agents" are chatbots with if-this-then-that functions that trigger events using APIs (the connectors between different software services), not taking actual actions, because that is not what LLMs can do. ServiceNow's AI agents that allegedly "act autonomously and proactively on your behalf" are, despite claiming they "go beyond ‘better chatbots,’" still ultimately chatbots that use APIs to trigger different events using if-this-then-that functions. Sometimes these chatbots can also answer questions that people might have, or trigger an event somewhere. Oh, right, that's the same thing. The closest we have to an "agent" of any kind is a coding agent, which can make a list of things that you might do on a software project and then go and generate the code and push stuff to Github when you ask them to, and they can do so "autonomously," in the sense that you can let them just run whatever task seems right. When I say "ask them to" or "go and" I mean that these agents are not remotely intelligent, and when let run rampant fuck up everything and create a bunch of extra work. Also, a study found that AI coding tools made engineers 19% slower. Nevertheless, none of these products are autonomous agents, and anybody using the term agent likely means "chatbot." And it's working because the media keeps repeating everything these companies say. I realize we've taken kind of a scenic route here, but I needed to lay the groundwork here, because I am well and truly alarmed. According to a UBS report from the 26th of June, the public companies running AI services are making absolutely pathetic amounts of money from AI: ServiceNow's use of "$250 million ACV" — so annual contract value — may be one of the more honest explanations of revenue I've seen, putting them in the upper echelons of AI revenue unless, of course, you think for two seconds, whether these are AI-specific contracts. Or, perhaps, are they contracts including AI? Eh, who cares. It's also year-long agreements that could churn, and according to Gartner, over 40% of "agentic AI" projects will be canceled by end of 2027. And really, ya gotta laugh at Adobe and Salesforce, both of whom have talked so god damn much about generative AI and yet have only made around $100 million in annualized revenue from it. Pathetic! These aren't futuristic numbers! They're barely product categories! And none of this seems to include costs. Oh well. I haven't really spent time on my favourite subject — OpenAI being a systemic risk to the tech industry. To recap: Anthropic is in a similar, but slightly better position — it is set to lose $3 billion this year on $4 billion of revenue. It also has no path to profitability, recently jacked up prices on Cursor, its largest customer, and had to put restraints on Claude Code after allowing users to burn 100% to 10,000% of their revenue. These are the actions of a desperate company. Nevertheless, OpenAI and Anthropic's revenues amount to, by my estimates, more than half of the entire revenue of the generative AI industry, including the hyperscalers. To be abundantly clear: the two companies that amount to around half of all generative artificial intelligence revenue are ONLY LOSING MONEY. I've said a lot of this before, which is why I'm not harping on about it, but the most important company in the entire AI industry needs to convert by the end of the year or it's effectively dead, and even if it does, it burns billions and billions of dollars a year and will die without continual funding. It has no path to profitability, and anyone telling you otherwise is a liar or a fantasist. Worse still, outside of OpenAI...what is there, really? As I wrote earlier in the year, there is really no significant adoption of generative AI services or products. ChatGPT has 500 million weekly users, and otherwise, it seems that other services struggle to get 15 million of them. And while the 500 million weekly users sounds — and, in fairness, is — impressive, there’s a world of difference between someone using a product as part of their job, and someone dicking around with an image generator, or a college student trying to cheat on their homework. Sidebar: Google cheated by combining Google Gemini with Google Assistant to claim that it has 350 million users. Don't care, sorry. This is worrying on so many levels, chief of which is that everybody has been talking about AI for three god damn years, everybody has said "AI" in every earnings and media appearance and exhausting blog post, and we still can't scrape together the bits needed to make a functional industry. I know some of you will probably read this and point to ChatGPT's users, and I quote myself here: It has, allegedly, 500 million weekly active users — and, by the last count, only 15.5 million paying subscribers, an absolutely putrid conversion rate even before you realize that the actual conversion rate would be monthly active subscribers. That’s how any real software company actually defines its metrics, by the fucking way. Why is this impressive? Because it grew fast? It literally had more PR and more marketing and more attention and more opportunities to sell to more people than any company has ever had in the history of anything. Every single industry has been told to think about AI for three years, and they’ve been told to do so because of a company called OpenAI. There isn’t a single god damn product since Google or Facebook that has had this level of media pressure, and both of those companies launched without the massive amount of media (and social media) that we have today. ChatGPT is a very successful growth product and an absolutely horrifying business. OpenAI is a banana republic that cannot function on its own, it does not resemble Uber, Amazon Web Services, or any other business in the past other than WeWork, the other company that SoftBank spent way too much money on. And outside of ChatGPT, there really isn't anything else. Before I wrap up — I'm tired, and I imagine you are too — I want to address something. Yes, generative AI has functionality. There are coding products and search products that people like and pay for. As I have discussed above, none of these companies are profitable, and until one of them is profitable, generative AI-based companies are not real businesses. In any case, the problem isn't so much that LLMs "don't do anything," but that people talk about them doing things they can't do. I believe that the generative AI market is a $50 billion revenue industry masquerading as a $1 trillion one, and the media is helping. As I've explained at length, the AI trade is not one based on revenue, user growth, the efficacy of tools or significance of any technological breakthrough. Stocks are not moving based on whether they are making money on AI, because if they were, they'd be moving downward. However, due to the vibes-based nature of the AI trade, companies are benefiting from the press inexplicably crediting growth to AI with no proof that that's the case. OpenAI is a terrible business, and the only businesses worse than OpenAI are the companies built on top of it. Large Language Models are too expensive to run, and have limited abilities beyond the ones I've named previously, and because everybody is running models that all, on some level, do the same thing, it's very hard for people to build really innovative products on top of them. And, ultimately, this entire trade hinges on GPUs. CoreWeave was initially funded by NVIDIA, its IPO funded partially by NVIDIA, NVIDIA is one of its customers, and CoreWeave raises debt on the GPUs it buys from NVIDIA to build more data centers, while also using the money to buy GPUs from NVIDIA. This isn’t me being polemic or hysterical — this is quite literally what is happening, and how CoreWeave operates. If you aren’t alarmed by that, I’m not sure what to tell you. Elsewhere, Oracle is buying $40 billion in GPUs for the still-unformed Stargate data center project, and Meta is building a Manhattan-sized data center to fill with NVIDIA GPUs. OpenAI is Microsoft's largest Azure client — an insanely risky proposition on multiple levels, not simply in the fact that it’s serving the revenue at-cost but that Microsoft executives believed OpenAI would fail in the long term when they invested in 2023 — and Microsoft is NVIDIA's largest client for GPUs, meaning that any changes to Microsoft's future interest in OpenAI, such as reducing its data center expansion, would eventually hit NVIDIA's revenue. Why do you think DeepSeek shocked the market? It wasn't because of any clunky story around training techniques. It was because it said to the market that NVIDIA might not sell more GPUs every single quarter in perpetuity. Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple, Amazon and Tesla aren't making much money from AI — in fact, they're losing billions of dollars on whatever revenues they do make from it. Their stock growth is not coming from actual revenue, but the vibes around "being an AI company," which means absolutely jack shit when you don't have the users, finances, or products to back them up. So, really, everything comes down to NVIDIA's ability to sell GPUs, and this industry, if we're really honest, at this point only exists to do so. Generative AI products do not provide significant revenue growth, its products are not useful in the way that unlocks significant business value, and the products that have some adoption run at such a grotesque loss. I realize I've thrown a lot at you, and, for the second time this year, written the longest thing I've ever written. But I needed to write this, because I'm really worried. We're in a bubble. If you do not think we're in a bubble, you are not looking outside. Apollo Global Chief Economist Torsten Slok said it last week. Well, okay, what he said was much worse: We are in a bubble. Generative AI does not do the things that it's being sold as doing, and the things it can actually do aren't the kind of things that create business returns, automate labor, or really do much more than one extension of a cloud software platform. The money isn't there, the users aren't there, every company seems to lose money and some companies lose so much money that it's impossible to tell how they'll survive. Worse still, this bubble is entirely symbolic. The bailouts of the Great Financial Crisis were focused on banks and funds that had failed because they ran out of money, and the TARP initiative existed to plug the holes with low-interest loans. There are few holes to plug here, because even if OpenAI and Anthropic somehow became eternal money-burners, the AI trade exists based on the continued and continually-increasing sale and use of GPUs. There are limited amounts of capital, but also limited amounts of data centers to actually put GPUs, and on top of that, at some point growth will slow at one of the Magnificent 7, at which point costs will have to come down from things that lose them tons of money, such as generative AI. Before you ask- You do not have proof for this statement! The cost of tokens going down is not the same thing as the cost of inference goes down! Everyone saying this is saying it because a guy once said it to them! You don't have proof! I have more proof for what I am saying! While it theoretically might be, all evidence points to larger models costing more money, especially reasoning-heavy ones like Claude Opus 4. Inference is not the only thing happening, and if this is your one response, you are a big bozo and doofus and should go back to making squeaky noises when you see tech executives or hear my name. Okay, so one argument is that these companies will use ASICs — customized chips for specific operations — to reduce the amount they're spending. A few thoughts: I am worried because despite all of these obvious, brutal and near-unfixable problems, everybody is walking around acting like things are going great with AI. The New York Times claims everybody is using AI for everything — a blatant lie, one that exists to prop up an industry that has categorically failed to deliver the innovations or returns that it promised, yet still receives glowing press from a tech and business media that refuses to look outside and see that the sky is red and frogs are landing everywhere. Other than the frog thing, I'm not even being dramatic. Everywhere you look in the AI trade, things get worse — no revenue, billions being burned, no moat, no infrastructure play, no comparables in history other than the dot com bubble and WeWork, and a series of flagrant lies spouted by the powerful and members of the press that are afraid of moving against market consensus. Worse still, despite NVIDIA's strength, NVIDIA is the market's weakness, through no fault of its own, really. Jensen Huang sells GPUs, people want to buy GPUs, and now the rest of the market is leaning aggressively on one company, feeding it billions of dollars in the hopes that the things they're buying start making them a profit. And that really is the most ridiculous thing. At the center of the AI trade sits GPUs that, on installation, immediately start losing the company in question money. Large Language Models burn cash for negative returns to build products that all kind of work the same way. If you're going to say I'm wrong, sit and think carefully about why. Is it because you don't want me to be right? Is it because you think "these companies will work it out"? This isn't anything like Uber, AWS, or any other situation. It is its own monstrosity, a creature of hubris and ignorance caused by a tech industry that's run out of ideas, built on top of one company. You can plead with me all you want about how there are actual people using AI. You've probably read the "My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts" blog, and if you're gonna send it to me, read the response from Nik Suresh first. If you're going to say that I "don't speak to people who actually use these products," you are categorically wrong and in denial. I am only writing with this aggressive tone because, for the best part of two years, I have been made to repeatedly explain myself in a way that no AI "optimist" is made, and I admit I resent it. I have written hundreds of thousands of words with hundreds of citations, and still, to this day, there are people who claim I am somehow flawed in my analysis, that I'm missing something, that I am somehow failing to make my case. The only people failing to make their case are the AI optimists still claiming that these companies are making "powerful AI." And once this bubble pops, I will be asking for an apology. I love ending pieces with personal thoughts about stuff because I am an emotional and overly honest person, and I enjoy writing a lot. I do not, however, enjoy telling you at length how brittle everything is. An ideal tech industry would be one built on innovation, revenue, real growth based on actual business returns that helped humans be better, not outright lie about replacing them. All that generative AI has done is show how much lust there is in both the markets and the media for replacing human labor — and yes, it is in the media too. I truly believe there are multiple reporters who feel genuine excitement when they write scary stories about how Dario Amodei says white collar workers will be fired in the next few years in favour of "agents" that will never exist. Everything I’m discussing is the result of the Rot Economy thesis I wrote back in 2023 — the growth-at-all-costs mindset that has driven every tech company to focus on increasing quarterly revenue numbers, even if the products suck, or are deeply unprofitable, or, in the case of generative AI, both. Nowhere has there been a more pungent version of the Rot Economy than in Large Language Models, or more specifically GPUs. By making everything about growth, you inevitably reach a point where the only thing you know how to do is spend money, and both LLMs and GPUs allowed big tech to do the thing that worked before — building a bunch of data centers and buying a bunch of chips — without making sure they’d done the crucial work of “making sure this would create products people like.” As a result, we’re now sitting on top of one of the most brittle situations in economic history — our markets held up by whether four or five companies will continue to buy chips that start losing them money the second they’re installed. I am disgusted by how many people are unwilling or unable to engage with the truth, favouring instead a scornful, contemptuous tone toward anybody who doesn't believe that generative AI is the future. If you are a writer that writes about AI smarmily insulting people who "don't understand AI," you are a shitty fucking writer, because either AI isn't that good or you're not good at explaining why it's good. Perhaps it's both. If you want to know my true agenda, it's that I see something in generative AI and its boosters something I truly dislike. Large Language Models authoritatively state things that are incorrect because they have no concept of right or wrong. I believe that the writers, managers and executives that find it exciting do so because it gives them the ability to pretend to be intelligent without actually learning anything, to do everything they can to avoid actual work or responsibility for themselves or others. There is an overwhelming condescension that comes from fans of generative AI — the sense that they know something you don't, something they double down on. We are being forced to use it by bosses, or services we like that now insist it's part of our documents or our search engines, not because it does something, but because those pushing it need us to use it to prove that they know what's going on. To quote my editor Matt Hughes: "...generative AI...is an expression of contempt towards people, one that considers them to be a commodity at best, and a rapidly-depreciating asset at worst." I haven't quite cracked why, but generative AI also brings out the worst in some people. By giving the illusion of labor, it excites those who are desperate to replace or commoditize it. By giving the illusion of education, it excites those who are too idle to actually learn things by convincing them that in a few minutes they can learn quantum physics. By giving the illusion of activity, it allows the gluttony of Business Idiots that control everything to pretend that they do something. By giving the illusion of futurity, it gives reporters that have long-since disconnected from actual software and hardware the ability to pretend that they know what's happening in the tech industry. And, fundamentally, its biggest illusion is economic activity, because despite being questionably-useful and burning billions of dollars, its need to do so creates a justification for spending billions of dollars on GPUs and data center sprawl, which allows big tech to sink money into something and give the illusion of growth. I love writing, but I don't love writing this. I think I'm right, and it’s not something I’m necessarily happy about. If I'm wrong, I'll explain how I'm wrong in great detail, and not shy away from taking accountability, but I really do not think I am, and that's why I'm so alarmed. What I am describing is a bubble, and one with an obvious weakness: one company's ability to sell hardware to four or five other companies, all to run services that lose billions of dollars. At some point the momentum behind NVIDIA slows. Maybe it won't even be sales slowing — maybe it'll just be the suggestion that one of its largest customers won't be buying as many GPUs. Perception matters just as much as actual numbers, and sometimes more, and a shift in sentiment could start a chain of events that knocks down the entire house of cards. I don't know when, I don't know how, but I really, really don't know how I'm wrong. I hate that so many people will see their retirements wrecked, and that so many people intentionally or accidentally helped steer the market in this reckless, needless and wasteful direction, all because big tech didn’t have a new way to show quarterly growth. I hate that so many people have lost their jobs because companies are spending the equivalent of the entire GDP of some European countries on data centers and GPUs that won’t actually deliver any value. But my purpose here is to explain to you, no matter your background or interests or creed or whatever way you found my work, why it happened. As you watch this collapse, I want you to tell your friends about why — the people responsible and the decisions they made — and make sure it’s clear that there are people responsible. Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Andy Jassy have overseen a needless, wasteful and destructive economic force that will harm our markets (and by a larger extension our economy) and the tech industry writ large, and when this is over, they must be held accountable. And remember that you, as a regular person, can understand all of this. These people want you to believe this is black magic, that you are wrong to worry about the billions wasted or question the usefulness of these tools. You are smarter than they reckon and stronger than they know, and a better future is one where you recognize this, and realize that power and money doesn’t make a man righteous, right, or smart.

Title: Morgan Stanley Dismisses Rumors of Apple Acquiring AI Search Firm

Latest news Morgan Stanley isn’t buying the hype around Apple acquiring a search-based AI firm like Perplexity. While some investors and analysts speculate that an acquisition could help Apple catch up in the AI race, Morgan Stanley sees it as the wrong move and not part of Apple’s playbook. In a note to investors, analyst Erik Woodring called the idea “misguided,” arguing that Apple has no intention of entering the search market. Instead, Apple is developing virtual assistant features using its own large language models and incorporating technology from third-party partners. Woodring added that Apple isn’t trying to compete with Google, Meta, or Amazon in the same way and won’t be delivering major AI-related updates in the September quarter. While AI progress remains gradual, Apple’s core business continues to perform. Morgan Stanley has raised its revenue forecast for Apple’s fiscal Q3 2025 to $90.7 billion, a 5.8% year-over-year increase. Stronger-than-expected iPhone shipments, higher average selling prices, and steady demand for iPads and Macs are driving the growth. In the note, the firm acknowledged investor concerns over the App Store injunction and Apple’s silence on Services guidance in the previous earnings call. But Morgan Stanley isn’t worried. It projects Services revenue will grow 11.6% year-over-year, and expects the App Store alone to match that figure. The analysts believe this will mark the eighth consecutive quarter of Services growth between 10% and 15%. AppleInsider, citing Morgan Stanley’s investor note, echoed the positive sentiment around the upcoming Q3 results. Favorable exchange rates and consistent consumer demand are boosting gains across product categories, according to the firm. It now estimates iPhone performance to exceed consensus by 2%, with iPads and Macs expected to beat earlier projections by 9% and 1% respectively. Morgan Stanley expects growth to slow in the September quarter but still remain positive. He now forecasts $96.5 billion in revenue for that period, up from a previous estimate of $95.7 billion. It also revised earnings per share from $1.56 to $1.61, factoring in dollar tailwinds and improved performance across hardware and Services. Gross margins are forecasted at 46.1%, absorbing $1.5 billion in tariff costs. Despite limited AI updates expected this year, Morgan Stanley remains bullish on Apple’s long-term position in the AI space. The firm does not expect Apple Intelligence to move forward in any meaningful way until after 2026 and sees no near-term progress in China either. Apple won’t be buying its way into the AI search game. Instead, it’s playing the long game with assistant-style features built on its own tech stack. Morgan Stanley still believes in that approach and has maintained its Overweight rating on Apple stock, with a price target of $235 above recent targets from both JPMorgan and HSBC.

ByRobert Barone ByRobert Barone, Contributor. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed once again at record highs on Friday (July 18).1 The DJIA was off marginally for both the week (-0.07%) and year to date (-0.79%).2 The Russell 2000, the small-cap index, is the canary in the coal mine. Generally speaking, small caps lead the major averages, especially when the economy slows. And while the Russell 2000 was up marginally for the week and nearly 3% so far in July, it is down nearly -8.3% from its peak and nearly -5.5% year to date.3 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. Using a simple average, six of the Magnificent 7 rose for the week (AAPL barely so). Year to date, three (NVDA, MSFT, META) are up double digits, two (AAPL, TSLA) are down double digits, while the other two (AMZN, GOOG) are just above/below the flatline.4 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. Jobs While the headline Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report for June looked relatively strong at +147K, beneath the surface, it wasn’t.5 First, there is the Birth/Death (B/D) model automatic add-on (ostensibly for small businesses that are not surveyed) at +76K.5 This is a large positive number that is simply added on without regard to the economic environment. The fact is applications for new businesses at the state/local level have fallen off a cliff recently.6 In addition, raw data show that state and local governments laid off -310K in June, but through the magic of seasonal adjustment, that number translated into +80K.5 So, that +80K plus the +76K from the B/D model (i.e., +156K) more than offset the total NFP headline number of +147K. Not much substance here! ADP, the payroll processor, has its own payroll series which comes out a couple days before the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ NFP report. Since it processes payrolls, we should take its data seriously. The ADP number for June was a loss of -33K jobs.7 (Note: the narrative that the economy is “strong” showed up in the consensus estimate of the ADP number which was +98K, only off by a whopping -131K!) The ADP survey breaks down the data by business size. In this case: small business: -47K, medium sized: -15K, large businesses: +30K.7 In the ADP report, the Education/Health sector lost -52K jobs (negative for three months in a row and in four of the last five), while Professional & Business Services, a proxy for temporary help, fell -56K.7 The latter is highly correlated with the overall health of the labor market. This weakness in the labor market is backed up by the contraction in the workweek (-0.3% in June vs. May).5 But, in a supposed sign of labor market strength, the U3 Unemployment Rate fell to 4.1% in June from 4.2% in May; markets were expecting a 4.3% reading.8 In fact, had the Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR), the percentage of the working aged population either working or looking for work and the denominator in the U3 calculation, stayed constant, the U3 rate would have risen to that 4.3% number.9 But the LFPR fell. And it fell because, according to the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Survey, jobs are “hard to get,” and those already unemployed have become discouraged and have stopped looking, thus lowering the labor force ranks.9 June 2025 jobs one-month net change According to economist David Rosenberg, “…private sector payrolls slowed sharply [in June], the most sluggish reading in five months. Stripping out the boom in health care/social assistance, we get +15K which is statistically insignificant and an 80% haircut from the average of the prior six months…”10 Conclusion: The labor market has turned soft and, in our view, we are going to see a significant rise in the unemployment rate by year’s end. And it is this factor that will, in the end, cause the Fed to embark upon a rate lowering cycle. Inflation Meanwhile, inflation remained persistent in June with the CPI rising at a hotter than expected +0.3% pace.11 Thankfully, the core CPI (ex-food, energy) is up at an annual rate of only 1.1% in the January to June period.12 While airfares (-0.1%), hotel/motel prices (-3.6%) and new (-0.3%) and used (-0.7%) car prices actually fell in June, we did see a pop in the prices of other key goods, notably appliances (+1.9%), toys (+1.8%), recreational goods (+0.8%) and clothing (+0.4%).11 The Producer Price Index (PPI) was better, coming in flat (0.0%) versus a market expectation of +0.2%.13 For the year/year reading, this index was up 2.3%, down from its May 2.7% rate.13 This is good news as PPI often leads the CPI. Consumer Prices (CPI) The Fed and Interest Rates The Fed continues to be very concerned (overly so, in our view) about the impact of Trump’s tariffs on inflation (i.e., the “tariff effect”) and thus, despite the soft data strongly supporting lower rates, is unlikely to reduce them at its upcoming July meetings (July 29-30).14 Some economists have even discounted a rate reduction at the Fed’s September meeting set.15 That would leave December as the first rate reduction meeting. Because changes in monetary policy impact the economy with a long lag, we believe that the Fed should be cutting interest rates now, as the underlying data are quickly deteriorating. Case in point: credit card delinquencies continue at high levels as shown in the chart below. They are now at their ’08-’09 levels.16 The same can be said for auto loans and bank business loans.16 Clearly, the economy is slowing, and the U.S. consumer will likely be cutting spending to pay down their bloated credit card balances and catch up on their auto payments. This will have a negative impact on consumption going forward. Credit Card Delinquencies (90+ Days) At the press conference of a Fed meeting several quarters ago, Chairman Powell revealed what he called his “super-core inflation index,” i.e., services excluding housing.17 It is a narrower measure than core inflation (which excludes food and energy prices). This measure has now risen at a 1.1% annual rate so far in 2025.17 Hence, it would appear that business and economic conditions are ripe for a rate cutting cycle. But that is the straight economic analysis and excludes political considerations. Anyone who stays in touch with current events knows that the media has hyperventilated over the President’s pressure on the Fed, and Chairman Powell in particular, to lower interest rates.18 The Fed was wisely set-up by Congress in the early 1900s as “independent” from other branches of government, i.e., the President has no jurisdiction aside from the ability to nominate candidates for vacant Federal Reserve Board seats. The press has been reporting that the President is looking for ways to “fire” Chairman Powell, but it is clear that the President doesn’t have such power.18 (Note: There is the “incompetent” argument. The White House thinks that Powell can be removed for such. And they appear to be pursuing the large cost overruns to rehab the Fed’s HQ Building in Washington, D.C. as proof. We doubt this will stick.) One question that remains in the background (and unspoken) is whether the Fed would, to spite the President, not lower rates when they otherwise would have!! We think such a scenario has a low probability; after all, there are 11 other voting members of the FOMC and Chairman Powell has always acted with integrity. Housing Another market needing rate relief is housing. The number of months of supply of existing homes for sale is now above the pandemic highs of 2020 as are rental vacancies.19 Existing Homes Monthly Supply and Rental Vacancy Rates: Houses and Apartments As a result, rents have begun to fall; and that will end up being a positive for the inflation file going forward.19 Net household formation (mainly in the population aged 25-34 that are forming households for the first time) has fallen to <1% at an annual rate, while homebuilders continue to produce new homes at their former rates when net household formation was higher.20 New Tenant Repeat Rent The resulting excess supply will weigh on new home prices and ultimately will reduce construction activity. Markets have already factored this in, as, despite the equity markets’ recent record highs, the Homebuilders’ Index in the S&P 500 is off -30% from its cycle peak.21 Hence, our view that home prices, both new and existing, are at or have passed their peaks for this cycle. Final Thoughts Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed again at record highs on Friday, July 18.1 But the small-cap Russell 2000, the canary in the coal mine, and the old economy industrials, the DJIA, appear to be singing from a different hymn book. Both are down for the year, the Russell by more than -5%.3 They appear to be telling us a different story regarding the state of the economy than are the large caps in the S&P 500. The tech heavy Magnificent 7 are also sending mixed signals. Nvidia, Microsoft and Meta are off to the races, while Apple and Tesla are down significantly year to date. Amazon and Google are flat.4 The payroll report looked strong on the surface, but a deep dive shows emerging weakness. Excluding the automatic add-on from the Birth/Death model calculation and the fact that state and local governments laid off -310K people in June, it is likely that payrolls were flat.5 In fact, ADP, the payroll processor, reported a loss of -33K jobs in June.7 Since they actually process payrolls, their number should be taken seriously. Unfortunately, it isn’t. Interest rates are the topic du jour. Controversy has erupted as the Trump Administration wants the Fed to lower rates with the President name-calling the Fed Chair.18 The CPI and the PPI appear to be slowly moving toward the Fed’s 2% inflation target.11 13 Our view is that, unforeseeable circumstances notwithstanding, because there is a long lag in the transmission of monetary policy, the Fed should be acting to lower rates now, especially since the consumer is starting to struggle (rising delinquencies).16 But the politics of the day may indeed get in the way of good policy. Housing usually leads the way in the business cycle, and this time appears to be no different. In the existing home space, inventories are high and rising, and vacancy rates are too.19 It appears to us that home prices have peaked.21 Robert Barone, Ph.D. (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.)

Title: Fed Should Act As Economy Slows—Will Politics Delay It?

ByRobert Barone ByRobert Barone, Contributor. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed once again at record highs on Friday (July 18).1 The DJIA was off marginally for both the week (-0.07%) and year to date (-0.79%).2 The Russell 2000, the small-cap index, is the canary in the coal mine. Generally speaking, small caps lead the major averages, especially when the economy slows. And while the Russell 2000 was up marginally for the week and nearly 3% so far in July, it is down nearly -8.3% from its peak and nearly -5.5% year to date.3 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. Using a simple average, six of the Magnificent 7 rose for the week (AAPL barely so). Year to date, three (NVDA, MSFT, META) are up double digits, two (AAPL, TSLA) are down double digits, while the other two (AMZN, GOOG) are just above/below the flatline.4 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. Jobs While the headline Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report for June looked relatively strong at +147K, beneath the surface, it wasn’t.5 First, there is the Birth/Death (B/D) model automatic add-on (ostensibly for small businesses that are not surveyed) at +76K.5 This is a large positive number that is simply added on without regard to the economic environment. The fact is applications for new businesses at the state/local level have fallen off a cliff recently.6 In addition, raw data show that state and local governments laid off -310K in June, but through the magic of seasonal adjustment, that number translated into +80K.5 So, that +80K plus the +76K from the B/D model (i.e., +156K) more than offset the total NFP headline number of +147K. Not much substance here! ADP, the payroll processor, has its own payroll series which comes out a couple days before the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ NFP report. Since it processes payrolls, we should take its data seriously. The ADP number for June was a loss of -33K jobs.7 (Note: the narrative that the economy is “strong” showed up in the consensus estimate of the ADP number which was +98K, only off by a whopping -131K!) The ADP survey breaks down the data by business size. In this case: small business: -47K, medium sized: -15K, large businesses: +30K.7 In the ADP report, the Education/Health sector lost -52K jobs (negative for three months in a row and in four of the last five), while Professional & Business Services, a proxy for temporary help, fell -56K.7 The latter is highly correlated with the overall health of the labor market. This weakness in the labor market is backed up by the contraction in the workweek (-0.3% in June vs. May).5 But, in a supposed sign of labor market strength, the U3 Unemployment Rate fell to 4.1% in June from 4.2% in May; markets were expecting a 4.3% reading.8 In fact, had the Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR), the percentage of the working aged population either working or looking for work and the denominator in the U3 calculation, stayed constant, the U3 rate would have risen to that 4.3% number.9 But the LFPR fell. And it fell because, according to the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Survey, jobs are “hard to get,” and those already unemployed have become discouraged and have stopped looking, thus lowering the labor force ranks.9 June 2025 jobs one-month net change According to economist David Rosenberg, “…private sector payrolls slowed sharply [in June], the most sluggish reading in five months. Stripping out the boom in health care/social assistance, we get +15K which is statistically insignificant and an 80% haircut from the average of the prior six months…”10 Conclusion: The labor market has turned soft and, in our view, we are going to see a significant rise in the unemployment rate by year’s end. And it is this factor that will, in the end, cause the Fed to embark upon a rate lowering cycle. Inflation Meanwhile, inflation remained persistent in June with the CPI rising at a hotter than expected +0.3% pace.11 Thankfully, the core CPI (ex-food, energy) is up at an annual rate of only 1.1% in the January to June period.12 While airfares (-0.1%), hotel/motel prices (-3.6%) and new (-0.3%) and used (-0.7%) car prices actually fell in June, we did see a pop in the prices of other key goods, notably appliances (+1.9%), toys (+1.8%), recreational goods (+0.8%) and clothing (+0.4%).11 The Producer Price Index (PPI) was better, coming in flat (0.0%) versus a market expectation of +0.2%.13 For the year/year reading, this index was up 2.3%, down from its May 2.7% rate.13 This is good news as PPI often leads the CPI. Consumer Prices (CPI) The Fed and Interest Rates The Fed continues to be very concerned (overly so, in our view) about the impact of Trump’s tariffs on inflation (i.e., the “tariff effect”) and thus, despite the soft data strongly supporting lower rates, is unlikely to reduce them at its upcoming July meetings (July 29-30).14 Some economists have even discounted a rate reduction at the Fed’s September meeting set.15 That would leave December as the first rate reduction meeting. Because changes in monetary policy impact the economy with a long lag, we believe that the Fed should be cutting interest rates now, as the underlying data are quickly deteriorating. Case in point: credit card delinquencies continue at high levels as shown in the chart below. They are now at their ’08-’09 levels.16 The same can be said for auto loans and bank business loans.16 Clearly, the economy is slowing, and the U.S. consumer will likely be cutting spending to pay down their bloated credit card balances and catch up on their auto payments. This will have a negative impact on consumption going forward. Credit Card Delinquencies (90+ Days) At the press conference of a Fed meeting several quarters ago, Chairman Powell revealed what he called his “super-core inflation index,” i.e., services excluding housing.17 It is a narrower measure than core inflation (which excludes food and energy prices). This measure has now risen at a 1.1% annual rate so far in 2025.17 Hence, it would appear that business and economic conditions are ripe for a rate cutting cycle. But that is the straight economic analysis and excludes political considerations. Anyone who stays in touch with current events knows that the media has hyperventilated over the President’s pressure on the Fed, and Chairman Powell in particular, to lower interest rates.18 The Fed was wisely set-up by Congress in the early 1900s as “independent” from other branches of government, i.e., the President has no jurisdiction aside from the ability to nominate candidates for vacant Federal Reserve Board seats. The press has been reporting that the President is looking for ways to “fire” Chairman Powell, but it is clear that the President doesn’t have such power.18 (Note: There is the “incompetent” argument. The White House thinks that Powell can be removed for such. And they appear to be pursuing the large cost overruns to rehab the Fed’s HQ Building in Washington, D.C. as proof. We doubt this will stick.) One question that remains in the background (and unspoken) is whether the Fed would, to spite the President, not lower rates when they otherwise would have!! We think such a scenario has a low probability; after all, there are 11 other voting members of the FOMC and Chairman Powell has always acted with integrity. Housing Another market needing rate relief is housing. The number of months of supply of existing homes for sale is now above the pandemic highs of 2020 as are rental vacancies.19 Existing Homes Monthly Supply and Rental Vacancy Rates: Houses and Apartments As a result, rents have begun to fall; and that will end up being a positive for the inflation file going forward.19 Net household formation (mainly in the population aged 25-34 that are forming households for the first time) has fallen to <1% at an annual rate, while homebuilders continue to produce new homes at their former rates when net household formation was higher.20 New Tenant Repeat Rent The resulting excess supply will weigh on new home prices and ultimately will reduce construction activity. Markets have already factored this in, as, despite the equity markets’ recent record highs, the Homebuilders’ Index in the S&P 500 is off -30% from its cycle peak.21 Hence, our view that home prices, both new and existing, are at or have passed their peaks for this cycle. Final Thoughts Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed again at record highs on Friday, July 18.1 But the small-cap Russell 2000, the canary in the coal mine, and the old economy industrials, the DJIA, appear to be singing from a different hymn book. Both are down for the year, the Russell by more than -5%.3 They appear to be telling us a different story regarding the state of the economy than are the large caps in the S&P 500. The tech heavy Magnificent 7 are also sending mixed signals. Nvidia, Microsoft and Meta are off to the races, while Apple and Tesla are down significantly year to date. Amazon and Google are flat.4 The payroll report looked strong on the surface, but a deep dive shows emerging weakness. Excluding the automatic add-on from the Birth/Death model calculation and the fact that state and local governments laid off -310K people in June, it is likely that payrolls were flat.5 In fact, ADP, the payroll processor, reported a loss of -33K jobs in June.7 Since they actually process payrolls, their number should be taken seriously. Unfortunately, it isn’t. Interest rates are the topic du jour. Controversy has erupted as the Trump Administration wants the Fed to lower rates with the President name-calling the Fed Chair.18 The CPI and the PPI appear to be slowly moving toward the Fed’s 2% inflation target.11 13 Our view is that, unforeseeable circumstances notwithstanding, because there is a long lag in the transmission of monetary policy, the Fed should be acting to lower rates now, especially since the consumer is starting to struggle (rising delinquencies).16 But the politics of the day may indeed get in the way of good policy. Housing usually leads the way in the business cycle, and this time appears to be no different. In the existing home space, inventories are high and rising, and vacancy rates are too.19 It appears to us that home prices have peaked.21 Robert Barone, Ph.D. (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.)

Title: Microsoft abruptly stops selling and renting movies and TV shows on Xbox and Windows devices

But existing customers will still be able to access their purchased content As of July 18, Microsoft has stopped selling and renting TV shows and movies on both Xbox and Windows devices. An update to both the Xbox and Windows websites confirms "Microsoft has stopped selling new movie and TV content." Microsoft did not provide a reason for the withdrawal of service, but did assure customers that existing paid content will remain available for the foreseeable future. "Existing customers can continue to access their previously purchased content on Windows and Xbox devices," the FAQ added, "[and] players can continue to play personal videos on Xbox devices. Windows customers can continue to have access to playback and the download functionality." In a FAQ that asks what other options players may have going forward, Microsoft suggests they make use of third-party entertainment apps like Amazon Prime and Apple TV. Xbox commenced its entertainment offerings in 2006, offering an initial lineup of TV shows and movies to gamers in the U.S. via Xbox Live on the one-year anniversary of its Xbox 360 console. It was the first gaming console to offer standard and high-definition TV shows and movies via digital distribution and formed part of Xbox's then lofty aspiration to be a comprehensive unified online entertainment network on its systems.

Title: Economist Warns the AI Bubble Is Worse Than Immediately Before the Dot-Com Implosion

For years now, certain experts have warned that the AI industry is a massive bubble waiting to burst. The enormous hype driving a market frenzy, they say, could lead to a collapse if it's exposed to be built on widespread overpromising. Most recently, Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Slok warned that the current AI bubble is starting to look even worse than the market conditions leading up to the dot-com implosion of the late 1990s. "The difference between the IT bubble in the 1990s and the AI bubble today is that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued than they were in the 1990s," Slok wrote in a note that was widely circulated online. A chart shows the price to earnings (P/E) ratios of the top ten performing companies in the S&P 500 against the rest of the index. A high P/E ratio, generally speaking, indicates that a stock's price is extremely high relative to its earnings. The chart shows that the P/E ratio continues to creep higher and higher over the last five years, well above the rates we saw throughout the 1990s. In other words, the top ten companies in the S&P 500 are far more overvalued than they were in the years leading up to the dot-com crisis. Slok is ringing the alarm bells over the apparent market frenzy, driven by tech titans that are heavily invested in the AI industry. By index weighting, AI chipmaker Nvidia leads the pack in the S&P 500, followed by Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet, all of which have made multibillion-dollar investments in AI. Yet earnings are still lagging far behind the astronomical spending on building out infrastructure, with some tech leaders already showing early signs of hesitancy, given the massive P/E discrepancy. Slok is far from the first to compare the current hype surrounding AI to the dot-com bubble. Even in 2023, when OpenAI's ChatGPT was only a few months old, analysts warned investors were overinvesting in unproven tech. AI critic Ed Zitron has also compared the situation to the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007, which led to the collapse of the US housing market. Silicon Valley's endless appetite for AI was seriously tested earlier this year when a Chinese AI company called DeepSeek demonstrated that its AI chatbot, which cost a fraction of the computing power to train as conventional models, could trade blows with the latest large language models from the likes of OpenAI, Meta, and Google, triggering a more than $1 trillion selloff at the time. How long investors will continue to prop up sky-high valuations of the key players in the AI race remains to be seen. Despite an explosion in popularity for tools like ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, revenue still pales in comparison to the tens of billions of dollars being spent on data center expansions. According to an S&P Global research note published in June, the generative AI market is projected to grow at a breakneck pace, reaching an aggregate revenue of $85 billion by 2029. However, when you consider that's only a little more than the over $60 billion Meta will spend on capital expenditures this year alone, tech companies still have a lot of reassuring to do that their massive bet on AI will eventually pay off — and not lead to the sequel of one of the biggest stock market crashes in history.

Arm (ARM) shares climbed Monday as analysts at Wells Fargo raised their price target for the chip designer’s stock ahead of quarterly earnings due next week. The analysts raised their target to $175 from $145, well above the mean of analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, which sits at about $143. Shares of Arm rose over 3% to close near $162 Monday, and have added roughly a third of their value in 2025. Arm, which develops CPU designs used in chips from companies like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, could be well-positioned to benefit from “expanding AI opportunities,” including growing data center demand, Wells Fargo told clients in a note Sunday. "We continue to estimate strong growth for Arm's royalties business despite tariff-related uncertainty," Wells Fargo said, adding that Arm’s ramp of AI and custom silicon designs could "drive meaningful royalty revenue growth” this fiscal year. Arm is scheduled to report fiscal first-quarter earnings after the market closes on July 30.

Title: Unilever’s Growth Comes From Finding Opportunity
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2025/07/21/unilevers-growth-comes-from-finding-opportunity/
Time Published: 2025-07-21T16:16:05Z
Full Content:
ByMegan Poinski ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff. The biggest business story of the last week has had nothing to do with tariffs, M&A, finance or earnings. It’s a relatively minor scandal. And since we’re all online, we’ve all seen it more times than we care to count: Former Astronomer CEO Andy Bryon was caught on camera at a Coldplay concert canoodling with the company’s Chief People Officer Kristen Cabot. On Friday, both Bryon and Cabot were placed on leave pending an investigation from the company’s board. On Saturday, Bryon resigned. “Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met,” the company said on X. Chief Product Officer and cofounder Pete DeJoy is taking over as interim CEO while Bryon’s replacement is sought. Astronomer’s company name has been dragged through the mud, though the vast majority of people sharing the image of Bryon and Cabot probably could not even describe what the company does. Astronomer is a company that uses Apache Airflow to manage data operations, helping companies leverage data for AI integration, application development and unlock deeper insights. The company closed a $93 million Series D round in May, led by Bain Capital Ventures and Salesforce Ventures. The press release detailing the funding round highlights several key accomplishments over the past 12 months: 150% year-over-year recurring revenue growth, 130% net revenue retention, and a two-year path to profitability. The company was valued at more than $1 billion at the time of the funding round. Will the new exposure and speedy investigation ultimately bring Astronomer more business? Or will Bryon and Cabot’s viral moment cost the company customers? It’s doubtful on both counts. As a B2B tech company, Astronomer’s external reputation probably won’t come into play. And in a few months the general public may still be talking about the Coldplay kiss cam moment, but they most likely won’t be talking about Astronomer as a company. Will the viral moment make fundraising more difficult? Potentially, since company leaders are the ones who need to steward new money, and poor personal choices of former executives may reflect badly on the board members and leaders who hired them in the first place. This serves as a reminder that executives always represent their companies–even during off-hours. This viral moment might have been forgotten by now if it didn’t involve two leaders of a company. Byron and Cabot’s positions add a layer of gawking and gossip, bringing a tech company into many conversations where it never would have found itself otherwise. Even as the global economy has grown more cautious and uncertain, Unilever has been on a steady path. I spoke with Herrish Patel, president of Unilever USA and CEO of its Personal Care North America division, about the company’s growth and plans for the future. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. A trader on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange last week. What cautious economy? Looking at the top-line financial numbers from last week, stocks surged as many companies reported better-than-expected profits. The S&P 500 set a new record high on Thursday, as 88% of companies reporting earnings so far this quarter exceeded expectations. Unemployment claims hit 221,000 last week, down 7,000 from the week before, and June’s retail sales were up 0.6% over May, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Despite all of these positive numbers, however, tariffs are still waiting in the wings, writes Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman. According to President Donald Trump’s latest deadlines, many of them will start on August 1, and could begin to impact the prices companies and consumers pay soon thereafter. Countries and companies are working to figure out how to blunt the majority of the impact when they come, the Washington Post reports. Meanwhile, Forbes senior contributor Jim Osman writes that there is a distressing sign coming from consumers: 5.1% of all car loans are delinquent, marking a 15-year high in subprime loan delinquencies. Osman writes car loans tend to be the last payment Americans skip. When times are tight, they may miss a credit card, utility, mortgage or rent payment, but vehicles tend to be the last thing they will risk losing. Osman writes that credit stress is spreading as household debt increases, while credit card and buy-now, pay-later companies tighten their standards.

In Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill, food and drinks in the office will cost companies more starting on January 1, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb. Office coffee, snacks and employee meals got a 50% tax break under Trump’s signature 2017 financial policy bill, but it expires at the end of this year. The perk did not get renewed in the latest policy bill. (Unless you work on a fishing vessel in Alaska or a restaurant, that is.) The end of the deduction will raise $32.5 billion over the next decade, Erb writes—a relatively small increase in revenue, considering the bill includes tax cuts adding up to $4.475 trillion in the next decade. The question now facing companies is whether to continue stocking the office kitchen with goodies. A 2023 survey found that eight in 10 employees said catered meals encouraged them to come into the office, and 98% said free meals at work makes them feel appreciated. But considering the other internal cost issues that may be at play in 2026, it could be difficult for companies to choose a non-deductible employee perk. OpenAI logo at the World News Media Congress in Poland. There are many challenges to enterprise AI deployment, including how to best use it. OpenAI is reportedly getting into this space. The Information recently reported that the provider is offering enterprise-grade GPT-4o deployments staffed with its engineers at a starting price of $10 million, writes Forbes contributor Sol Rashidi. Consulting can yield higher margins of 40% to 60%, Rashidi writes. OpenAI isn’t the only AI provider rushing into consulting. Google, Meta and Anthropic are all trying to augment their tools with deployment assistance. And while it is pricey to add deployment services on top of the platform agreement and software access, some companies may find it worthwhile to guarantee a smooth integration with AI systems. OpenAI is adding more to its offerings, launching its ChatGPT Agent last week. The agent is a virtual assistant that can complete work and various simple tasks, such as creating slide decks from notes, purchasing ingredients from a recipe or submitting expense reports. It will be available on enterprise plans in coming weeks, the company said. Unilever USA President and CEO of Personal Care North America Herrish Patel. Herrish Patel has worked for Unilever, one of the world’s largest CPG companies, for 24 years. In nearly a quarter century, the global company specializing in beauty, personal care, home care, food products and ice cream has taken Patel and his family around the globe, giving him a multifaceted perspective on how to innovate and grow already-strong brands. He became the president of Unilever USA and the CEO of its Personal Care North America division in 2024. I spoke with him about how he’s growing brands that are already in 98% of American homes, plus how he strengthens his team at a company that is an international behemoth. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. What is your strategy to build the U.S. market and getting to growth? Patel: It starts with the trends that are going to shape the U.S. I’m a big believer that the role of leadership teams in your categories is to predict where a category is going to be in three years from now. I call it getting to the future faster, or take the organization to the future and then bring them back. If I look at personal care and where it will be in three to five years, there’s certain segments, like whole body deodorants. The reality is, over the last couple of years, some insurgent brands brought to life the idea that we sweat beyond the armpit, and it’s built a whole new leg to the category, to a segment that could be $500 million going forward. The second piece is serum technology. We invented bar [soap] in a way. We then went into liquids. The next frontier will be serum technology, which is starting to converge the next generation of moisturization and body wash. Again, technology led. Lastly, you see it on TikTok and social media, people are looking for mood transportation through showers through neural signaling. We’re making an adjacency move on a brand called Olly, a vitamin supplement brand full of scientific claims and a sense that is good for karma, it’s good for mood. We are obsessed about having the science and technology, the right packaging, the right communication platform. That’s the first thing that is at the heartbeat of the business, and we’re obsessed about being market makers, category builders. The second piece is you work with the biggest retailers in the U.S. to be a category leader. You act like a category leader, you show up like a category leader and you start to share how you’re going to build the category over multiple years through your marketing and science investments. We’ve shared this U.S.-for-U.S. [A recent quote said] it’s like a new Unilever that’s agile, it’s fast and it’s moving with consumer trends which move fast in the U.S. You mentioned team building. How do you do that with a company that is as large as Unilever? In Personal Care, we call it ‘Making it personal.’ Once you have your strategy and your big bets, you build a structure to be in service to the strategy. Then strategy, structure and sourcing. Sourcing is the talent. There’s also a strategic position. You’ve built a team first that is designed to deliver the strategic position of Unilever. We serve 98% of American households, so we are going to move categories forward. The second piece that I’m a big fan of, is what I call wasting time together. It means that you invest and spend time getting to know the team. Trust and unity comes when you know beyond the face: what’s important in their lives, family, friends, how they grew up. That shapes some of the behaviors you see. Thirdly, once you’ve got a structure, you waste time, you build trust. We call it objectives, key results, OKRs. I call them mountains we’re trying to climb. Behind that strategy’s three or four mountains, we constantly sit and review where we are on that mountain, what have we learned, what we want to adjust. Then we work as a team to say the next stage of that mountain looks X or Y. Yesterday, we sat for a whole day as a leadership team and did exactly that. What are we celebrating? What is the strategic progress we’re making? Is the organization running to its potential? What are some of the leadership learnings, and where do we need to inspire and move the organization forward? I call it hardware and software. 50% is hardware, is strategy. 50% is software, and making sure the team is united in that journey. Right now we are in a period of economic uncertainty, and it’s hard to forecast anything. How does that impact Unilever? We see the recession as an opportunity, [rather] than more of a threat. What we will see is a polarization where people will seek value, while some consumers will still seek premiumization. From a U.S. perspective, we’ve got a portfolio that serves brilliant value, but we’ve also got a premium portfolio. As it continues to polarize, we’ve got a portfolio—I call it how you win the recession. We consciously talk about it. How do you come out stronger from the recession? That takes leadership, it takes a point of view. Sometimes you get it right, sometimes you get it wrong, but it’s important to have a strong point of view. That you take the moment where there might be some economic uncertainty for maybe two or three quarters, but we come out stronger as a consequence. What advice would you give to other business executives? This is a really important time of leadership. I think it is the time to reflect on who we are, what we stand for, and make sure that we continue to serve the U.S. with the latest innovations and grow our businesses. Personally, I think this is a moment of your own values, your own leadership style, and how you continue to adjust to lead the organization through it. I think the future is really bright in the U.S., so I think the economic outlook long-term, mid-term, will be very strong. What I’m inspired by is the thousands that work for Unilever U.S. still wake up wanting to make an impact at 98% of US households. That’s my job. How do I create an environment where everyone can flourish and maximize their potential? And that's what I do every day. My reflective moment is how can I lead to create that environment, to serve all of America, and my people are inspired to do it; they believe they have an impact.

The rush to attract the global investor at all hours of the day is on. Charles Schwab (SCHW) said Monday it is adding more securities, primarily ETFs, for 24-hour trading, bringing the total to 1,100 stocks and funds that retail investors can access outside normal U.S. business hours. The online broker extended trading access to its clients for stocks in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, as well as a range of exchange-traded funds, in February. Its rivals Robinhood (HOOD) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), have extended trading hours that go beyond both the regular session, during which volumes are highest, and the traditional premarket and after-hours sessions. “As the pace of interconnected global markets activity increases and market-moving news and events happen outside of regular U.S. market hours, 24-hour trading gives investors flexibility and access that can be critical to take advantage of potential opportunities – as well as helping to manage risk," Charles Schwab Managing Director James Kostulias said. The most-traded stocks that Charles Schwab said it has seen since launching 24-hour trading earlier this year are shares of Tesla (TSLA), AI darling Nvidia (NVDA), and Chinese EV maker NIO (NIO), the company said.

QuantumScape stock just took a nosedive — plunging nearly 17% in a single day — leaving investors scrambling for answers. The solid-state battery startup, once hailed as a potential game-changer in the electric vehicle (EV) revolution, had just ridden a massive wave of enthusiasm around its new “Cobra” separator technology. But Monday’s dramatic sell-off shows just how fragile that momentum can be. So, what triggered this sudden reversal, and what does it mean for the future of this high-profile EV battery maker?

July 21, 2025 09:22 ET | Source: WeRide Inc. WeRide Inc. GUANGZHOU, China, July 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WeRide (NASDAQ: WRD), a global leader in autonomous driving technology, today launched the HPC 3.0 high-performance computing platform, jointly developed with Lenovo (HKSE: 0992) and powered by NVIDIA's (NASDAQ: NVDA) latest DRIVE AGX Thor chips. The new HPC 3.0 platform makes its debut in WeRide's latest-generation Robotaxi GXR — making it the world's first mass-produced Level 4 (L4) autonomous vehicle built on NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor. Fully automotive-grade, HPC 3.0 reduces autonomous driving suite cost by 50%, paving the way for GXR's large-scale commercial deployment. WeRide's HPC 3.0 platform, featuring a dual NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor configuration running the safety-certified DriveOS, is built on Lenovo's AD1 L4 autonomous driving domain controller — delivering up to 2,000 TOPS of AI compute. It is the most powerful computing platform available to support L4 autonomy. The HPC 3.0 platform, developed by WeRide and Lenovo, features dual NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor chips and is the most powerful computing platform for L4 autonomy Beyond core upgrades, HPC 3.0 boosts system integration, cutting mass production costs to a quarter of HPC 2.0 and reducing autonomous driving suite cost by 50%. It also consolidates key modules such as Ethernet gateway, CAN gateway, inertial navigation, and collision detection, reducing both production and maintenance expenses. This lowers HPC 3.0's total cost of ownership (TCO) by 84% over its lifecycle compared to its predecessor. HPC 3.0 is certified to AEC-Q100, ISO 26262, and IATF 16949 standards. Its redundant design architecture meets the highest ASIL-D safety level, with a failure rate below 50 FIT (failures per billion hours of operation) and a MTBF (mean time between failures) of 120,000 to 180,000 hours. Built for 10 years or 300,000 km of use, it is capable of operating in extreme temperatures from -40°C to 85°C and passes tests for heat, shock, and corrosion. HPC 3.0 is also fully compliant with global VOCs environmental standards, making it suitable for deployment across the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Europe, and other international markets — supporting WeRide's goal of scaling its Robotaxi fleet worldwide. “Our close collaboration with Lenovo and NVIDIA represents a major breakthrough in computing power, system architecture, and cost efficiency. Integrating the HPC 3.0 platform into our Robotaxi GXR enhances vehicle reliability and responsiveness while significantly reducing deployment costs. Moving forward, we plan to extend this platform across more of our L4 autonomous vehicles — including the Robobus, and Robosweeper — bringing smart, accessible mobility to more cities and customers worldwide,” said Tony Han, Founder and CEO of WeRide. “We're thrilled to see the successful deployment of NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor on WeRide's Robotaxi GXR, marking a significant step towards bringing L4 autonomous vehicles to market at scale.

Title: Why Has GE Vernova Stock Moved 68%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/07/21/why-has-ge-vernova-stock-moved-68/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images GE Vernova (NYSE: GEV) is experiencing significant momentum. Since it emerged as an independent energy entity in early 2024, its stock has soared nearly 68% year-to-date. This performance isn't merely strong—it far surpasses market expectations, crushing the S&P. So, what is driving this impressive surge? At its essence, GE Vernova is benefiting from a robust energy infrastructure supercycle. With the rapid expansion of AI data centers, electrification, and grid developments, there is a pressing need for infrastructure—and Vernova’s gas turbines, grid technology, and renewable energy solutions are central to this growth. The firm has reported a significant increase in turbine orders, and its backlog has now surpassed $120 billion. This demand is not just busy—it signifies a booked-out-for-years scenario. With the AI boom also playing a role, it becomes clear why major investors are investing heavily. Although GEV stock has shown volatility, if you're looking for potential rewards with less fluctuation than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns of over 91% since its launch. When GE separated into distinct companies, Vernova was perceived as the more industrial, slower-growing counterpart. However, that perception has quickly changed. The company has strengthened its balance sheet, enhanced profit margins, and demonstrated impressive execution under its new leadership. All attention is focused on the Q2 earnings report (scheduled for July 23), with expectations soaring. If Vernova continues to exceed projections and demonstrate solid profitability, the upward trend could persist. The AI energy boom shows no signs of fading—and Vernova’s turbines are right at the heart of the action. High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which includes a selection of 30 stocks, boasts a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why does this happen? As a collection, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a smoother experience, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Best International Equity ETFs of 2025

With European markets consistently outperforming their US counterparts, investors are eyeing funds tracking foreign companies. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com ETFs are booming in the US, but that doesn’t mean investors are keeping their investments stateside. International equity ETFs that invest in publicly traded companies have surged this year, posting returns of 20% or more and cementing international funds at the top of the heap of the best performing funds of 2025’s first half. The massive gains were due to overperforming European markets and strong performing sectors in other countries. The outperformance in Europe, relative to both the US and international stocks more broadly, can be attributed to an “increased willingness” for those countries to invest in companies that help drive economic growth, said Zachary Evens, a Morningstar research analyst. “Banks and utilities and industrials and communication service companies, like telecoms, these companies are more boring,” he said. “They don’t typically grow very fast, but they benefit from broad economic growth, so a lot of the outperformance has been concentrated in some of those stocks.” European stocks have outperformed their US counterparts for the past three years, reversing a trend of US dominance that began following the Great Recession, with the MSCI EMU Index outpacing the S&P 500 by more than 35 percentage points since 2022, according to Schwab. International stocks in general have also beaten American stocks, as measured by the MSCI EAFE Index. Some of the top-performing international markets ETFs so far this year are: Still, diversification is key to avoiding region-specific downturns. “If Spain grows by a lot, but France falters, then diversification will even that out… That also goes for the sector side,” said Evens. “You would be better suited to be more diversified across sectors and countries to minimize those negative impacts.” All Hail the Sector. Sector performance tends to be the main driver of stock performance, with US markets leaning heavily on tech companies in recent years. Still, outside factors — inflation, political deals, tariffs — have an impact on sectors, which in turn affects markets, according to Evens. “What impacts the performance of those sectors would be more idiosyncratic risks or geopolitical factors, or economic factors,” he said. “Weighing those is how investors can think about potential outperformance or underperformance of the respective markets.” An ETF from Roundhill Investments trades out of S&P 500 ETFs before dividends are paid, thus avoiding the tax implications. It may be only a matter of time before the Securities and Exchange Commission lets crypto ETFs redeem their digital assets in kind. The business Michael Venuto started over a decade ago has become one of the go-to places for small firms looking to launch ETFs. The asset manager has asked the SEC to make QQQ an open-end fund, which would benefit Invesco and its shareholders. The company’s latest spin on protected Bitcoin investing includes Calamos ETFs that diversify their exposure to a range of Bitcoin funds. The price of Bitcoin hit a record high of $123,000 this week as Congress prepares to vote on landmark crypto legislation. JPMorgan, T. Rowe Price, and Capital Group had some of the top-performing funds of the first half of 2025, according to a recent Morningstar report. A handful of asset managers reported earnings Tuesday. The firm has launched nine total fixed-income ETFs this year. Trump’s media company has filed for a third crypto-focused ETF that would hold Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, Cronos and XRP. The agency’s new guidelines focus on disclosures around price fluctuations and market manipulation, among other common concerns. The fund pulled in more than $18 million in assets over two days last week but has seen negligible interest from investors long term. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Trump sharpens the axe for the Education Department. Swing away, Mr. President. | Opinion

Full Content:
The largest employer in the United States isn't a Fortune 100 company like Alphabet, Amazon or Apple. It's the federal government − and that's a problem. Thankfully, President Donald Trump continues to slash bureaucratic bloat. On July 11, the administration sent layoff notices to more than 1,300 State Department workers, and three days later, the Supreme Court allowed Trump to move forward with plans to gut the Department of Education. That's bad news for government employees, but great for taxpayers, especially given the Education Department's expense − $268 billion in the last fiscal year − and its lack of effectiveness. Despite the department's massive budget, students in the U.S. far too often lag behind peers in other industrialized countries. In 2022, for example, American 15-year-olds scored behind peers from 25 other countries on an international math test. And we're losing ground. Math and reading scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress continue to decline. Part of the drop can be attributed to pandemic-related learning loss, but reading scores in the U.S. began to decline in 2019 − before Americans had even heard of COVID-19. But how will pulling the federal government out of K-12 education help? It's important to note that more than 90% of public school funding comes from state and local governments along with foundations and other private sources. Much of the federal education budget is used to feed the bureaucracy, which generates rules and regulations that local administrators and teachers must obey. If all of that bureaucratic oversight consistently produced better results, there might be a case for keeping it. But the data clearly shows it doesn't. Removing federal bureaucrats from our schools should give states and local school districts more flexibility to set education policy, and that should improve choices for parents like me. Returning more control to the states also should improve efficiency and enable schools to better meet students' needs. Trump isn't cutting jobs only at the Education Department, of course. The State Department layoffs follow reductions at other federal agencies this spring. The cuts are driven by necessity: Our national debt is now more than $37 trillion, and the annual budget deficit will top $1 trillion again in 2025. So, I was surprised to see news reports paint the laid off State Department workers as heroic. Cameras caught teary goodbyes and applause for well-liked employees. I don't recall the same concern when President Joe Biden halted construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, which cost 1,500 workers their jobs and eliminated plans to create thousands more. While job loss is certainly scary, and I don't wish it on anyone, federal job cuts should be put in the context of the overall jobs market. Microsoft has announced that it would eliminate 9,000 jobs, not because the company is failing but because it's retooling as the market changes. Other companies, including Intel and Meta, have announced plans to restructure this year as the emergence of artificial intelligence and other technology changes how Americans work. The federal government should be as flexible as our top companies in adapting to a changing world. Yet, progressives have criticized the Trump administration's efforts to restructure the federal bureaucracy as cruel. The president's job, however, isn't to employ as many bureaucrats as possible. It's to deliver effective services as efficiently as possible to taxpayers. Dismantling ineffective and inefficient bureaucracies like the Education Department is a long overdue step toward achieving that goal.

Today, the Indian stock market ended on a positive note, with the Nifty 50 closing at around 25,092, up approximately 0.5% from the previous close. The key driver behind this upbeat session was the strong quarterly earnings reports from major private sector banks, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, whose shares rose around +2.2% following their better-than-expected profits. This buoyed the financial sector, which was the lone major sector with a notable gain of about 1.2%, offsetting losses seen in other sectors. Despite the broader market showing some signs of caution, especially as Reliance Industries saw a 3.2% dip due to concerns over softness in its oil-to-chemicals and retail segments, the financial stocks’ performance helped lift the benchmarks. The Sensex also climbed by about 0.5% to nearly 82,200, supported primarily by the banking rally. The mid-cap and small-cap segments remained largely subdued, indicating selective buying focused on quality blue-chip names. The market’s resilience amid mixed corporate results and sectoral divergences. The strong earnings by the banking sector are instilling confidence, but investors remain cautious ahead of a heavy earnings week. Eternal posted consolidated net profit for the quarter ended June 2025 at ₹25 crore, as against ₹253 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. Total income increased to ₹7,521 crore during the quarter under review, as against ₹4,203 crore in the year-ago period.

It is the only global company to have expanded to an integrated end-to-end platform that combines its extensive nationwide network, technology-driven solutions, and deep domain expertise.

Equirus Capital * RELIANCE posted a resilient 1QFY26 EBITDA of Rs 429bn (+11% yoy, -2% qoq), slightly below EE, with strong growth in R-Jio (+7% qoq EBITDA) and retail (+11% yoy). O2C was steady qoq but missed EE, while upstream remained soft. PAT surged to Rs 307bn (+37% qoq) aided by Rs 89bn gains on Asian Paints stake and higher interest income. * R-Jio continued to anchor growth with rising ARPU, robust net adds, and digital scale-up (broadband, FWA). We model a 12%/15% revenue/EBITDA CAGR over FY25-FY27E. Retail stayed in recovery with 8-quarter high store adds and margins steady at 7.2%. We expect a 12% revenue/EBITDA CAGR as restructuring eases and SSSg normalises. * O2C margins should gradually improve, with EBITDA/mt rising from US$ 91 in FY25 to US$ 105 by FY27, with easing feedstock pressures and better spreads amid record-low inventories. * Retail scale-up visibility, O2C margin bottoming, and commissioning of New Energy assets support our FY25-FY27E EBITDA CAGR of 19%. Retain ADD with a Sep’26 TP of Rs 1,546. Near-term triggers: Tariff hikes, retail recovery, value unlocking in R-Jio. Jio Platforms – growth visibility strong: R-Jio reported a solid 1Q with 7% qoq/24% yoy EBITDA growth and margins improving to ~52%. Growth was supported by rising ARPU (Rs 209, +15% yoy), strong net adds (10mn), and leadership across wireless (~51% market share), FWA, and broadband. Jio AirFiber subscribers crossed 7.4mn, making it the largest FWA platform globally. As per TRAI (May’25), Bharti Airtel (31% market share) and Vodafone (13%) had 302mn and 127mn subscribers, respectively. Looking ahead, we expect a 12%/15% revenue/EBITDA CAGR over FY25-FY27E, led by rising fixed broadband penetration, modest tariff hikes, and continued subscriber additions. Retail – recovery in motion : Reliance Retail delivered 11% yoy EBITDA growth, aided by continued store expansion (+252 qoq to 19,592). Margins were stable yoy at 7.2% (down 20bps qoq). Digital commerce scaled up strongly – JioMart daily order volumes jumped 175% yoy, and AJIO Rush sustained its early momentum. We expect 12% revenue/EBITDA CAGR over FY25-FY27E, as store restructuring and SSSg normalise. O2C – margin normalisation to drive modest upside: Despite throughput pressure from planned M&I, EBITDA grew 11% yoy to Rs 145bn, with stable qoq EBITDA/mt at US$ 98. However, higher feedstock and freight costs weighed on qoq profitability. We expect margins to improve steadily, with EBITDA/mt rising from US$ 91 in FY25 to US$ 105 by FY27. New Energy – execution phase begins: The business is entering a critical execution phase, with large-scale investments underway across solar PV, storage, green hydrogen, and supply chain. Giga-factory commissioning is expected over the next 4-6 quarters. We value the New Energy vertical at 1.5x invested capital, implying a value of ~Rs.1.2tn (5% of total value).

He was joined on the dais by Sanjay Nayar, President Assocham and Sajjan Jindal, Past President Assocham and Chairman JSW Group. Mr. Goyal also said that the EFTA-India FTA agreement will take effect on October 1, 2025. He urged ASSOCHAM members present at the meeting to focus on scale and quality to remain competitive and take advantage of these FTAs. He also highlighted the need to focus on innovation to stay competitive. The event saw the participation of leading CEOs from Indian Industry including Mr. B K Goenka, Chairman Welspun World, Dr. Niranjan Hiranandani, Founder & Chairman, Hiranandani Group, Mr. Vineet Aggarwal, Managing Director, Transport Corporation of India Ltd., Mr. M K Sanghi, Chairman, M K Sanghi Group, Mr. Sunil Kanoria, Trustee, Kanoria Foundation, Ms Falguni Nayar, CEO of Nykaa, Mr. Sanjeev Mehta, Executive Chairman, El Carterton India, Mr. Anant Goenka, Vice Chairman, RPG Group and Mr. Gunit Chadha, Founder and MD, APAC Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. among others. Speaking at the event, the minister said the FDI commitment would also create a million direct jobs in the coming years, and help technology and innovation through Swiss SMEs entering Indian markets “My calculation, or my gut sense is that $100 billion FDI, along with Indian promoter equity, when they come into your companies, it will catalyse to at least $500 billion investment in India into brownfield or greenfield,” said the minister. Citing a game-changing initiative, Mr. Goyal said that the cabinet has sanctioned ₹1 lakh crore towards an innovation fund to drive R&D in the country. “When I tell you that a 1 lakh crore rupees, which is about $12 billion, invest it, it’ll multiply through many rotations. It can be given out to all of you or any company willing to do it in, research and development in the form of a grant, in the form of low-cost loan, interest-free loan, long term loan,” said Mr. Goyal. Recognizing the pivotal role of MSMEs, Mr. Goyal stressed the need for enabling these enterprises with access to global markets, modern technology, and affordable capital. With 2.4 million STEM graduates annually, including 43% women, India is well-positioned to scale up its manufacturing and innovation capabilities. Recognising India’s potential as a global capability hub, he said the country can emerge as a high-quality destination for Global Capability Centers (GCCs), as India now offers, comparable or superior talent at a fifth of global costs, lower-than-expected real estate and energy costs, and a compelling alternative to offshore operations, amid declining H1B dependency. On the social security pact with the UK, Goyal said India has successfully negotiated a social security agreement with the UK, enabling Indian professionals on short-term UK work visas (up to 3 years) to contribute Indian EPF accounts rather than losing 25% of their overseas earnings in UK social security contributions. When asked by a delegate on the government’s Bharat Mart initiative, the union minister highlighted plans to replicate a similar model for Indian MSMEs, particularly leveraging Mumbai’s strategic and financial advantage, with government support and incentives promised. On the upcoming EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which mandates supply chain traceability for seven commodities (like coffee, wood, furniture, etc.), requiring detailed farmer and production data to be uploaded, the minister acknowledged this regulation as a non-tariff barrier. He urged Indian industries to proactively engage and negotiate such barriers and emphasised that quality compliance, not just quantity, must be a national priority.
