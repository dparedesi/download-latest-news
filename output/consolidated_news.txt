Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. An investment fund backs up the truck ahead of Spark’s half-year earnings on Friday. An insider details Callaghan ‘chaos’ as the agency enters its defunding death spiral. An Invercargill-born entrepreneur scores A$5 million for his start-up. It’s 3am Eternal for owners of US shares who’ve gained access to extended trading. And an authoritative poll reveals who could lead a DOGE-like initiative in NZ - or not. Ahead of its half-year earnings this Friday, some analysts and fund managers still rate Spark a “sell”. Others say it’s been beaten down so far its shares are a “buy”. ACC has just revealed it is in Camp Buy. Our state accident insurer’s investment wing – which has leaned tech-sceptic over the past couple of years, compared to our other Crown giant, the NZ Super Fund – disclosed on February 13 that it had topped up its stake in Spark to just above the 5% major holding threshold between October 12 and February 12 by purchasing $52.2 million worth of Spark shares on the NZX and A$27.5m ($30m) worth on the ASX. Craigs is Camp Sell – or at least it put Spark in its bad books as its earnings preview clumped NZX firms into positive, neutral and negative piles. After an unusual miss for its full-year earnings, delivered last August, Spark surprised again – and again in a bad way – by lowering its FY2025 guidance in October. Craigs says there is “some chance of a further downgrade” but that this possibility is already built into the telco’s price. “A key focus will be on FCF [free cashflow] cover for dividends and the extent to which the current weakness is macro-driven or due to increased competition.” In other words, how much of a poor result could be pinned on the crummy economy and Government IT departments shelving their chequebooks, and how much can down to post-merger 2degrees being on a roll? Morningstar’s Brian Han says investors have over-sold, and Spark represents good buying as long as it sees through cost-cutting. Forsyth Barr analysts Aaron Ibbotson and Benjamin Crozier, who downgraded Spark to “underperform” on February 14, with a $2.80 12-month target (shares closed Friday at $2.90), said there is “potential for a restructuring charge to be pulled out of its ebitda [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation] guidance”. The pair also want an update on the capital-raising push announced at Spark’s full-year result in August, when chair Justine Smyth said the telco would explore various options to raise $1b for data-centre expansion over the next five years. They want to see a construction timeline, too. A Callaghan Innovation insider alleges potential issues with commercial contracts and an ongoing hazchem disposal issues Some 350 Callaghan Innovation staff already know their agency is going to lose its funding on June 30 – with some jobs going to other agencies, if on a lag of up to six months, with enabling legislation for science sector changes not due before Parliament before the fourth quarter and not coming into effect until next year. Callaghan offers research services for early-stage firms and developers of new technologies, and administers growth grants and the Government’s tax rebate for R&D. Earlier this month, the Public Service Association said Callaghan staff did not know who would get a role with another agency under a sweeping science sector restructure or when – leading some to look offshore for work in what the union says is a “brain-drain of the Government’s own making”. Late last week, a Callaghan staffer – whose name has been withheld – wrote to the Herald about what they saw as “the chaos and widespread damage caused by the Government’s decision to disestablish this vital department. Most of us were told of the closure only on the morning the press release went out, leaving staff completely stunned and unprepared”. “I would like to particularly highlight the significant losses and the catastrophic consequences of the lack of planning surrounding this enormous decision. The situation at Callaghan is an utter shambles and it’s clear that nothing has been properly thought out. From the perspective of both staff and many established customers, it feels as though the Government is attempting to fly a plane while it is still being built,” the staffer wrote. “For example, no one at Callaghan knows when their final paycheque will come. Only the 80 staff members who were given four weeks’ notice on February 12 – mostly from the research & development team, business innovation advisors and some internal functions like marketing – have any certainty. For everyone else, there is no clarity on when we will be let go, except that it will happen in ‘waves’. “This lack of detailed information has serious consequences for employees’ ability to plan for the future and, more importantly, their mental health.” They continued: “The Gracefield [research] site has received no direction on what will happen next. Staff are being forced to figure out not only how to manage the loss of staff but also how to dispose of chemicals and other scientific materials safely. The risk of legal and compliance issues resulting from this poor planning is substantial and the administrative cost of unwinding this hasty and poorly managed shutdown will only increase over time.” Last year, a leaked memo said hazardous goods storage is not up to scratch in some of Callaghan’s laboratories, with $120m in remediatory work required over the next five years. In a letter of expectations leaked to the Herald earlier this month, new Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Shane Reti instructed Callaghan to “explore commercial opportunities to retain the Gracefield site as a centre for science and innovation” – presumably for the yet-to-be-detailed public research organisation envisioned by the Government. The staffer continued: “Callaghan scientists also undertake critical scientific research under contract for numerous businesses. “These contracts often extend well beyond the June disestablishment date, leaving customers in limbo, unsure of who, if anyone, will be able to carry on their commercial work. “Many of these businesses are now facing serious challenges, with expensive and time-sensitive R&D work halted with no plan for how to proceed. The scientists working on these projects are highly specialised and their expertise cannot be easily replaced.” Tech Insider put the staffer’s comments to Callaghan chief executive Stefan Korn. “I know this is a difficult and distressing time for our people. We’re working at pace to give staff and customers certainty about how the disestablishment of the organisation will affect them,” Korn replied. “However, winding up an organisation as complicated as Callaghan Innovation is not straightforward. We have multiple challenges to work through, including the transfer of some functions to other entities, the shutdown of other parts of the organisation and the safe and effective management of the Gracefield Innovation Quarter [GIQ]. “For example, planning work is now under way to safely deal with the disposal of a large range of chemicals and hazardous substances that have been used by the scientists at GIQ over the years.” Korn added: “As much as we would’ve liked to give people answers on day one, it’s important to work through the detail and get things right. “We’re doing everything we can to support our people and customers in this transition.” “The science sector reforms aim to ensure we focus our investment that will generate greatest value for our economy and our people,” Reti said. “Callaghan Innovation was spread too thin across many conflicting functions – it’s struggled to work to a clear focused purpose. “To better support and incentivise innovation for economic growth, we have decided to disestablish Callaghan Innovation and establish a new Public Research Organisation [PRO] to focus on delivering research in AI [artificial intelligence], synthetic biology, aerospace, medical and quantum technologies. “Some of Callaghan’s functions will be transferred to MBIE [the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment] or the new PRO. “Some functions will not be transferred, so an in-principle decision has been made for the funding to be reallocated. “I understand that in this round of change, the board of Callaghan Innovation has considered roles that aren’t currently working on customer contracts. “I acknowledge that these changes will be challenging for staff involved. I am confident that the science reforms ... will strengthen our science system and create more opportunities for economic growth over time.” Earlier this month, Callaghan senior research scientist Ben Wylie-van Eerd told the Herald that while the Government had outlined plans for a new advanced technology research organisation, the lack of a firm timeline – other than a legislative timetable indicating it was at least six months away, and probably more – meant a lot of his colleagues were already job-hunting for offshore roles. Trump’s talking up more tariffs. Ukraine is offering the US priority access to lithium as it bargains for its life. Think Tesla’s going to have a good day? Now you place a punt before the Nasdaq’s opening bell. Trading platform CMC recently launched extended-hours trading on the “Magnificent Seven” stocks (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla). The move proved so popular that CMC has now increased the breadth of extended hours trading to 80 popular US stocks, CMC’s Markets New Zealand general manager Chris Smith says. Kiwis can start pre-market trading from 10pm NZT, well before the US stock exchanges open at 3.30am NZT. “We’ve seen recently that international news can have a major impact on markets and we want to give our investors the best opportunity to react as fast as they can,” Smith told Tech Insider. Invercargill-raised Derek Troy-West has raised A$5m at a $A25m valuation for the software start-up he founded with his wife. Troy-West did a computer science degree at Auckland University then worked as a software developer for Spark before heading to the UK for a few years, where he met his wife Kylie Forge (now Kylie Troy-West), an Australian also on her OE after graduating from La Trobe. The pair settled back in Melbourne in 2012 and founded Factor House in 2019. The start-up builds developer tools that allow engineers to manage the processing of massive amounts of real-time data. Its first product, Kpow, is an engineering toolkit designed to enhance and simplify the management of Kafka – an open-source distributed-event-streaming platform developed by LinkedIn that allows data to be transported efficiently and accurately between different systems and applications. Customers include Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Block, Pepperstone and Afterpay. The A$5m seed raise was led by Australasia’s largest venture capital (VC) firm, Blackbird. Factor House said the round was supported by others including Auckland-based angel investor Steven Holmes – who made his investment in a personal capacity but is perhaps best-known in the VC community as the director of rich-lister Murray Bolton’s family office, Bolton Equities. Sorry, I had to ask. Half of my self-selecting sample of my followers on LinkedIn hated the idea of Prime Minister Christopher Luxon replicating Elon Musk’s DOGE rampage in the US with a local tech figure in charge. I would have added recent policy enthusiast Rod Drury, too, but LinkedIn only allows four choices (and doesn’t support embedding, so I had to recreate it above but see the original here). You could say former Telecom and Spark executive Simon Moutter is now in the frame, too, given he was recently made chair of Kāinga Ora (with former Spark “chief turnaround officer” Matt Crockett appointed Kāinga Ora’s chief executive around the same time). Comments ranged from “the constitutional equivalent of arson” to “I don’t think anyone in NZ has the stomach for it” to various proposals to streamline a spending purger with AI. Steven Joyce and Richie McCaw got write-ins. Feel free to leave your take in Comments below (once Comments are open). Chris Keall is an Auckland-based member of the Herald’s business team. He joined the Herald in 2018 and is the technology editor and a senior business writer. Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Warren Buffett continues to unload billions of dollars of Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in Bank of America (BAC). New SEC filings show Buffett sold 117.4 million shares of BAC worth about $5.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, reducing its stake in the financial giant to 8.9%. Meanwhile, Berkshire added a new investment in the alcoholic beverages producer Constellation Brands (STZ), which brews both Corona and Modelo Especial. The firm accumulated about $1.2 billion of Constellation stock at year end after buying 5.6 million shares. In Q4, Berkshire also bought about 12 million shares of satellite radio provider Sirius XM (SIRI), worth about $325 million, and bought 1.1 million more shares of Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), worth about $470 million. Despite the new investments, Berkshire continues to sit on a record $300 billion in cash.

Title: AIL round-up: Clontarf beat Cork Con to make it tight at the top

Only one point separates the top four in Division 1A after a weekend in which, despite dropping a place to fourth, Clontarf were probably the biggest winners. Their dramatic 15-13 victory over Cork Constitution at a rain-soaked Castle Avenue completed a double over the reigning champions. Clontarf had most of the possession, territory and visits to the red zone but Con led 7-0 at the break thanks to a try by George Good. After an Aaron Coleman try for Clontarf, the visitors looked well placed to extend their eight-game winning when James Taylor’s superb penalty put them 13-5 ahead. But after a Conor Kelly penalty, Clontarf laid siege and had claims for a penalty try rejected before appearing to have butchered their last chance. However, Con opted to run down the clock off their ensuing scrum, Adam Maher fumbled on his own line and Coleman pounced for his second try. Kelly’s conversion was the last kick of the game. Clontarf can go top if they beat City of Armagh in their game in hand next Saturday. Con stayed top as Terenure’s seven-match unbeaten run ended with 31-29 loss in City of Armagh, who thus completed a double over last year’s runners-up. The home side led 24-8 early in the second half through tries by Andrew Willis, Jonny Morton and Sam Cunningham before a quick-fire double by Jordan Coghlan and Ethan Reilly made it a two-point game. After Cunningham’s second, a try by Alan Bennie earned the visitors two bonus points although they left aggrieved after the referee’s positioning of the game’s last penalty before messing up their last lineout. St Mary’s returned to winning ways with a 36-14 win over UCD at Templeville Road as tries by Daniel Leane, Mark Fogarty, Greg Jones, Richie Fahy and Leandro Ramirez earned them an unrivalled 10th attacking bonus point. Lansdowne are six points outside the top four after a 29-14 home win over Young Munster, a result that severely dents the latter’s semi-final hopes. Andy Marks set Lansdowne on their way with his 11th try of the season, and further tries by Jack Matthews, Hardus van Eeden and Juan Beukes sealed a five-point haul. On a mostly grim day for Limerick clubs Garryowen led 12-7 at half-time in Dooradoyle thanks to two tries by Ronan Quinn. But Zac Ward’s second and the boot of Conor Rankin inflicted a 13th successive loss on the home side and kept Ballynahinch’s play-off hopes alive. Old Belvedere and Instonians took big strides toward the 1B and 2A titles respectively with 13-10 and 31-12 home wins over Old Wesley and Corinthians. Trinity had an important 20-19 win over Shannon at College Park to ease fears of a second successive relegation while increasing the chances of that happening to the nine-time champions - four points adrift in 10th place and 12 behind the students. Such a fate looks inevitable for free-falling Buccaneers, whose 13th defeat in 13 games, by 42-10 at home to Old Crescent, leaves them 18 points adrift in 2A.

These five Berkshire Hathaway holdings represent compelling investment opportunities for long-term ... [+] investors in 2025. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio has long served as a beacon for value investors seeking quality companies with durable competitive advantages. As we move through 2025, several of Berkshire's holdings stand out as attractive investments, combining strong fundamentals with reasonable valuations despite the broader market's continued focus on technology and growth stocks. This analysis examines five of the most promising Berkshire Hathaway positions that offer investors strong business models, competitive moats and potential for long-term capital appreciation. Each selection represents a company that aligns with Buffett's investment philosophy and appears well-positioned for success in today's evolving economic landscape. Buffett’s investment strategy centers on identifying companies with strong competitive advantages, capable management teams and the ability to generate consistent free cash flow. His philosophy emphasizes purchasing great businesses at reasonable prices rather than mediocre businesses at bargain prices. This approach has proven successful through multiple market cycles, with Berkshire Hathaway delivering compound annual returns well above market averages over several decades. The “Oracle of Omaha” focuses on businesses he understands, avoiding complex technologies or models lacking transparent earnings potential. He prioritizes companies with pricing power, strong brand recognition and the ability to maintain or expand market share even during economic downturns. This conservative yet effective approach has made Buffett one of history's most successful investors. This selection process focused on Berkshire Hathaway’s current portfolio holdings, analyzing each position based on fundamental strength, market position and alignment with Buffett's investment principles. I prioritized companies with strong cash flows, reasonable valuations and durable competitive advantages. Special attention was paid to recent business performance, management effectiveness and potential catalysts for future growth. Each selected company was evaluated against current market conditions and sector-specific challenges. I considered factors such as return on equity, debt levels and free cash flow generation. Additionally, I examined each company's ability to maintain or grow market share in their respective industries while delivering consistent returns to shareholders. Bank of America is one of the largest financial institutions in the United States, serving approximately 66 million consumers and small business clients with about 4,000 retail financial centers. The bank has successfully transformed its digital capabilities, with over 90% of all consumer transactions now conducted through digital channels. Their conservative lending practices and strong balance sheet position them well in the current economic environment. Bank of America represents Berkshire's largest financial sector holding, with a stake now valued north of $35 billion and accounting for more than 8% of Berkshire's portfolio, and for good reason. The bank's diversified revenue streams, with consumer banking contributing around 35% of revenue, wealth management above 20%, and investment banking approximately 25%, coupled with a tier 1 capital ratio exceeding 11%, position it well amid varying economic conditions. Their strong capital position, with stress test results showing capacity to maintain dividends even under severe economic scenarios, and focus on operational efficiency – demonstrated by a cost-to-income ratio below 60% and declining – make it well-positioned to benefit from the current interest rate environment above 5%. Net interest income margins have expanded north of 2.5%, contributing to return on equity around 15%. Recent investments exceeding $3.5 billion annually in digital technology have improved customer satisfaction scores above 80% while reducing operating costs by approximately 20% per transaction, leading to enhanced profitability metrics. Digital engagement now exceeds 75% of total consumer interactions, with mobile users growing at around 10% annually. The bank's efficiency ratio has improved to below 60%, while maintaining a loan-to-deposit ratio around 70%, providing ample liquidity for future growth. Their wealth management division alone generates over $5 billion in annual revenue, with client balances north of $3 trillion, providing stable fee-based income regardless of interest rate fluctuations. Coca-Cola remains the world's largest non-alcoholic beverage company, with a portfolio of more than 200 brands sold in over 200 countries. The company's recent strategic initiatives have focused on expanding its presence in growing categories such as ready-to-drink coffee, sports drinks, and premium waters. Their adaptive business model has successfully responded to changing consumer preferences while maintaining strong brand equity. As one of Buffett's longest-held positions, acquired for less than $1.3 billion and now worth north of $25 billion, Coca-Cola exemplifies his preference for businesses with strong brands and pricing power, demonstrated by operating margins above 30% despite inflationary pressures and ability to maintain price increases around 8% annually without significant volume impact. The company's extensive distribution network, reaching over 200 markets globally and servicing north of 25 million retail customer outlets, coupled with marketing capabilities exceeding $4 billion annually, create significant barriers to entry. Their market share exceeds 45% in global carbonated beverages, while maintaining a presence in over 80% of all food service locations worldwide. The company's strategic expansion into healthier beverages, with non-carbonated brands growing at around 15% annually and now representing more than 30% of portfolio revenue, effectively addresses changing consumer trends. Premium water brands alone contribute north of $7 billion in annual revenue, growing at double-digit rates. The company has increased its dividend for 61 consecutive years, demonstrating remarkable consistency in shareholder returns, with a payout ratio around 75% and free cash flow conversion exceeding 95% of net income. Their return on invested capital remains above 20%, while maintaining a global brand value estimated north of $90 billion, making it one of the most valuable brands worldwide. Apple has evolved from a computer manufacturer into a global technology ecosystem encompassing hardware, software and services. The company's iPhone remains its flagship product, but its services segment, including Apple Music, iCloud and the App Store, has grown to represent over 20% of revenue. Recent ventures into augmented reality and artificial intelligence demonstrate its continued innovation leadership. Despite being a technology company, Apple fits Buffett's investment criteria through its industry-leading brand loyalty, with retention rates north of 90% in its core iPhone business, unmatched pricing power evidenced by average selling prices around 50% higher than competitors, and massive cash generation exceeding $100 billion annually. The company's ecosystem creates high switching costs through over 2 billion active devices globally, while its services business, growing at around 15% annually and maintaining margins above 70%, provides recurring revenue streams now accounting for north of 25% of total revenue. Apple's share repurchase program, having returned over $600 billion to shareholders since inception and reducing share count by approximately 25%, combines with a dividend that's grown at a double-digit rate for over a decade. The company's fortress balance sheet, with north of $150 billion in cash and investments, and market leadership position – commanding around 50% of the premium smartphone market in North America and maintaining App Store gross margins above 80% – make it a compelling long-term investment. The company's emerging revenue streams, including wearables growing at over 20% annually and representing a market size larger than 75% of Fortune 500 companies, coupled with its nascent AI initiatives and rumored electric vehicle ambitions, provide multiple vectors for future growth while maintaining operating margins above 30%. Occidental Petroleum is a leading oil and gas producer with premier assets in the Permian Basin. The company’s integrated business model includes chemical manufacturing and carbon management solutions. Recent investments in carbon capture technology and low-carbon initiatives position OXY as a leader in sustainable energy production. Buffett's significant stake in Occidental, now representing north of 25% ownership of the company, reflects his confidence in the company's management and long-term energy market position in the Permian Basin, where OXY maintains around 40% lower production costs compared to industry averages. The company's robust free cash flow generation, exceeding $3 billion quarterly at current oil prices, coupled with a strengthened balance sheet that has reduced net debt by more than 50% since 2020, supports continued dividend growth and an aggressive share repurchase program targeting around 15% of market cap annually. Operating margins hover above 30%, significantly outpacing industry peers, while the return on capital employed remains north of 20%. OXY's leadership in carbon capture technology, with over $5 billion committed to direct air capture facilities and enhanced oil recovery methods yielding around 25% higher recovery rates than conventional methods, provides substantial competitive advantages in an increasingly environmentally conscious industry. The company's carbon management business is projected to contribute north of $1 billion in annual revenue by 2027, while its enhanced oil recovery techniques reduce carbon intensity by approximately 20% compared to traditional extraction methods. OXY maintains significant financial flexibility even in challenging price environments with a breakeven price below $40 per barrel and operating costs in the lowest quartile of global producers. Moody's is a leading global integrated risk assessment firm, providing credit ratings, research, tools and analysis that contribute to transparent financial markets. The company's analytics division has expanded significantly, offering software solutions for risk management, financial analysis, and regulatory compliance. Recent acquisitions have strengthened its position in ESG and climate risk assessment. Moody's exemplifies Buffett's preference for companies with wide economic moats and predictable earnings, demonstrated by its industry-leading operating margins of just under 50% and return on equity in the 70-80% range. The company's oligopolistic market position in credit ratings, with a 32% global market share, coupled with high entry barriers and strong recurring revenue from its analytics business – which now accounts for over 30% of total revenue and grew by over 15% year-over-year – creates a powerful competitive advantage. The analytics division's recurring revenue model has pushed contract renewal rates to north of 90%, while the average contract value has increased by double digits annually over the past three years. Growing demand for risk assessment tools and ESG analytics, evidenced by 35% + growth in ESG-related revenues and a pipeline of (over $2.5 billion) in potential analytics contracts, provides additional growth opportunities while maintaining high margins. The company's asset-light business model generates exceptional free cash flow conversion of over 75% of net income, supporting reinvestment in growth initiatives and shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks. These five Berkshire Hathaway holdings represent compelling investment opportunities for long-term investors in 2025. Each company possesses the characteristics Buffett values: strong competitive positions, capable management teams and the ability to generate consistent cash flows. From Bank of America's financial strength to Apple's ecosystem dominance, and from Coca-Cola's brand power to Occidental's energy leadership and Moody's market dominance, these selections offer a diversified approach to value investing aligned with Buffett's time-tested principles. While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, these companies appear well-positioned to deliver sustainable returns in the years ahead. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: 5 unique ways I use Android 15’s Private Space that aren’t for porn or cheating

Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. Published onFebruary 16, 2025 When Android 15 landed with Private Space in tow, everyone — me included — winked at their screen and nodded, knowing exactly what that new feature would be used for. I won’t delve into your or my private business; that’s not exactly my jam. But when I activated Private Space on my Pixel 9 Pro (it’s a Pixel exclusive for now), I realized that it’s a very powerful and unique addition to my Android phone that enables me to do things I couldn’t before. With time, I’ve come across five different use cases for Private Space that make it essential for me because of security, privacy, distraction management, or convenience. If you’re not familiar with the feature, check out how to activate and use Private Space, and then follow me as I explain how I personally use it. If my Android phone falls into the hands of a thief, especially if they manage to snatch it from me when it’s unlocked or if they somehow steal my PIN code, I don’t want them to have access to my most sensitive apps. Hiding financial apps under Private Space, and making sure Private Space itself is hidden too, adds one more layer of security. This ensures that thieves or nosy people either don’t see these apps at all or aren’t able to access them because they’re locked behind a different PIN code. (Google has a disclaimer about malicious apps or adb being able to detect private apps, but I still think it’s worth it for being one more layer to deter petty thieves.) I do leave one banking app in the main app drawer, though — usually the one with the smallest account and no credit card access. That’s usually my day-to-day account. The other apps often live in my Private Space, though I’ve had to make peace with the fact that I never receive any notifications from them because of the feature’s limitation. That’s usually fine, except for French banking apps, which always require me to validate any online payment by going through the app and agreeing. Since I don’t get any notifications, I have to manually unlock Private Space, open the app, and then agree to the payment pop-up, but that’s a small price to pay for extra security. I’ve also tried putting the apps for my smart lock and security system in Private Space to stop anyone from opening my front door or disarming my alarm, but the problem is that I do definitely rely on getting notifications from these apps. A workaround would be to create two users with different permissions — one visible in my app drawer with limited powers and one hidden in Private Space with admin privileges — but I haven’t been able to dial in those permissions exactly to my liking. So for now, these apps remain in my main app list. I also attempted to hide 1Password, my password manager, to keep any passwords away from prying eyes, but I noticed that I heavily rely on it as an autofill solution and I can’t use that if it’s locked in private. Manually checking login details every time was very inconvenient. I know that using two different password managers would circumvent that, but it’s a very overkill solution for me, for now. Notifications aren’t the only thing that Private Space stops. The feature essentially sandboxes and quarantines apps in a separate environment with no access to my contacts, calendar, files, photos, or anything else on my phone. And that’s absolutely perfect when I want to use an app that I don’t completely trust. Sometimes it’s an app from a developer I don’t know, sometimes it’s a random app I’m briefly testing and want to delete later, and sometimes, it’s just Twitter X. No matter the reason, if there’s an app I’m not so sure about or want to keep away from the rest of my phone, then Private Space is where I’ll install it. That way I know that I’m giving it less room to roam and less data to siphon by default. Plus, when Private Space is locked, potentially problematic apps can’t perform any background actions, use any of my phone’s sensors, or track me across other apps. Private Space keeps them off and offline, and I love that. I have four Google accounts, three of which I use daily (personal, work, and shared with my husband). The fourth one is an old shared account that my husband and I created on a trip to Austria when we were still living in Lebanon. It was meant to help us get access to Google features and apps that were available in the EU but not on a Lebanese account. Since then, we’ve moved to France and created a shared French account, so this fourth account is not longer essential. But it still has a thing or two that we care about and that we weren’t able to migrate or were too lazy to migrate. Since I rarely use this account, I don’t want it installed on my phone, littering every account picker and account switcher menu. I just want access to some things a few times a year. Previously, I accessed it from the browser sometimes or added it to my phone then remove it, but not anymore. Now, that’s the account I associate with my Private Space account and I can just let it be, untouched, for weeks on end, then when I need to check it, I just unlock Private Space and open Gmail, Chrome, Keep, or Maps to check it out. If I could quarantine all of my apps, I would, but for now, Instagram and Threads would have to do. Keeping them locked away means I’m not tempted to open them when I see that icon in my app drawer. With no notifications and no background updates, they have no way to disturb me, either. I’ve tried putting a time restriction on apps with Digital Wellbeing, but that didn’t do much, and I always ended up unpausing the app once the timer hit. With Private Space, I find that I’m less inclined to open the app because it’s hidden away from my eyes. Out of sight, out of mind, as the proverb says. There are a million and one reasons for why you’d need to have two instances of the same app, and the sad part is that stock Android doesn’t allow this when other skins offer it. With Private Space, though, we have a workaround that lets us create a second and independent instance of an app on a Pixel phone. I find this is very useful in apps that don’t allow me to have multiple accounts logged in at the same time. Amazon, for example, requires a multi-step process to let me switch from my French account to my US, German, Spanish, or Italian ones. And since some items are sometimes heavily discounted in other countries but not in France, I just want quick access to those countries’ stores without messing with my main account. That’s why I use a secondary instance of Amazon to check prices and order items from other countries. I also have two Spotify accounts in different locales that are useful when I come across geo-restricted music. Instead of logging out and in again, I can just check my second account, see if it’s available there, then decide if it’s worth going through any extra hoops to listen to that music or not. It’s a very restricted use case, but it’s come in handy once or twice. There are also other apps where I have both a personal account and a joint one with my husband. Booking.com, GetYourGuide, ChatGPT, and Uber are some of the ones that come to mind, and being able to have both accounts logged in on the same phone is a time-saver. This is where my journey with Private Space ends for now. I know that for many, it’s a convenient way to hide their dirtiest secrets, but I really appreciate the feature for its immense potential. I just hope to see it come to stock Android and stop being a Pixel-exclusive feature.

Title: Earnings, Fed Watching, And Warren Buffett’s Annual Letter Ahead

Consumer inflation (CPI) was higher than expected in January. One of the culprits was airfare, with ... [+] used car prices and auto insurance premiums adding to the rise. (Photo by Tim Boyle/Getty Images) Earnings season is nearing the finish line, with over three-quarters of the fourth-quarter earnings season complete. The pace of earnings releases eases to 45 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. 76% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. Only one of the Magnificent 7, NVIDIA (NVDA), is left to release earnings on February 26. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA). S&P 500 Earnings Season The S&P 500 rose 1.5% for the week, with the Magnificent 7 outperforming with a 2.1% gain. Markets were pleasantly surprised with President Trump’s announcement that ordered a study of reciprocal tariffs rather than an immediate implementation. Market Returns According to FactSet data, multiple sectors drove the improvement in the earnings growth rate for the week. The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by communications services and consumer discretionary. The energy sector is at the bottom, with a forecasted almost twenty-eight percent decline in year-over-year earnings. 4Q 2024 Estimated Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. Expected sales growth was unchanged for the week at 5.2% but exceeding expectations at the start of earnings season, with the tailwind from 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. 4Q 2024 Sales Estimates By Sector Due primarily to the robust earnings growth for financials, communication services, and consumer discretionary, the blended earnings performance has significantly outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +16.9% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Consumer inflation (CPI) came in hot for January, rising to a 3% year-over-year rate. Used cars, airfares, and auto insurance premiums were a large part of the story behind the numbers. Inflation has recently accelerated, with the 3-month annualized rate at 4.9%. Help from some of the volatile components and housing inflation should help it ease somewhat from here. U.S. Consumer Inflation: CPI Despite an ugly month-over-month gain for services inflation, excluding housing, the year-over-year rate declined to 4%. If services inflation continues to improve, markets and the Federal Reserve will rest easier about inflation fears. Services Inflation While December retail sales were revised higher, January data exhibited evidence of a broad-based spending hangover from the robust spending data at the end of last year. In addition, natural disasters may have weighed on spending. As long as U.S. employment continues to rise, consumer spending should snap back. Consumer Spending & Jobs Sluggish consumer spending caused the Atlanta Federal Reserve to cut its estimate of first-quarter GDP growth to 2.3%. This is nowhere near recessionary levels, but it is down from the robust growth estimate of 2.9% before the retail sales release. On a more positive note, the easing in economic growth estimates helped bring 10-year U.S. Treasury note yields down from higher levels following the hotter-than-expected consumer inflation reading. 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Without as much meaningful economic data this week and most of it impacted by natural disasters, the Federal Reserve meeting minutes on Wednesday could provide some clues to the timing of the next rate cut. The Fed is expected to be on the sidelines until at least mid-year when it might resume short-term interest rate cuts. Number Of Expected Rate Cuts Earnings season continues during the holiday-shortened week, but the pace of releases has begun to slow. Given President Trump’s feverish pace of policy announcements, markets will continue to be on guard, although market participants seem to be adapting to the new administration as is typical. The highlight of the week should be Berkshire Hathaway’s earnings and Warren Buffett’s highly anticipated annual letter on Saturday. This follows the release of the details of Berkshire Hathaway’s publicly traded stock portfolio last Friday. Buffett seems to have continued to reduce Berkshire’s allocation to stocks, but he added one new company to its stable of holdings. Disclosure: Glenview Trust holds many stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies.

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. Still unsure how to get the most out of AI? We asked AI leaders at top consulting firms how they use the tech, including the prompts they find most beneficial. On the agenda today: How severed undersea cables could be a big problem for the global financial system. But first: Meet the people shaking up the government. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. Elon Musk has been questioning — and dismantling — the workings of the United States of America Inc. Who is helping him with the job? This past weekend, one of our reporters saw a list of people tapped for Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, including four whose names had been previously unreported. Our reporters set out to learn more. Who was seen as qualified to help execute this historic and controversial undertaking? On Tuesday, we published our findings. Of the approximately 30 people on the list, most are early-career professionals in their 20s and 30s. They have backgrounds in tech, finance, law, and politics. They include software developers, former Supreme Court clerks, and a former McKinsey consultant. Read the full story here, which offers an exclusive look at the people executing Musk's overhaul of the federal government. The changes are also having an immediate impact on people who work for the federal government. This past week, BI got first-hand accounts of the abrupt firings of some probationary workers at the Small Business Administration and Office of Personnel Management. Thousands of probationary employees across multiple federal agencies were also fired. We are helping our readers keep track of DOGE-induced changes broadly, including this roundup. Some people are excited about what DOGE is doing. Others are horrified. Many feel a bit of both. Whatever your view, our job is to bring you the facts. We're staying on this mammoth story. Please as always, let us know what you think. eic@businessinsider.com. Meta's recent job cuts were part of the social media giant's plans to trim down 5% of its workforce by focusing on the lowest performers. But some terminated employees told BI they were shocked they were being let go given their track record. Internal guidance from Meta's director of people experience — viewed by BI — said managers were allowed to cut higher-performing employees if they couldn't meet their reduction targets. That left some workers who were impacted feeling misrepresented by Meta's stance on layoffs. Now they're worried about how it will impact job prospects.

As traditional media companies lose eyeballs to creator-led platforms like YouTube and TikTok, the MrBeast model, as untamed as it is, can offer Hollywood some useful lessons. Take notes, Hollywood.

The undersea cable network is vast — and so are its threats. There have been mysterious cases of cable damage that can disrupt financial firms, and some officials are accusing China and Russia. Even islands the size of Taiwan have felt the impact, losing internet access following some cable snaps. Severed cables aren't easy — or cheap — to repair, either. How to mitigate the risk.

Title: How to avoid being labeled an 'underperformer,' according to the ex-VP of HR at Microsoft
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-avoid-underperformer-label-and-layoffs-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-16T10:15:48Z
Full Content:
Several companies are laying off people they call "underperformers." Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Intuit have all recently done this. The lesson from these layoffs is that simply doing your job well isn't enough. You can toil away for decades doing a fine job and still get caught up in these layoffs. To avoid what seems like a random label, it helps to understand how it happens. On its face, it seems obvious: If a company wants to reduce costs, it makes sense to discard the poorest-performing people. The issue is the haphazard way these evaluations are often done. Dozens of long-term employees from Meta, Microsoft, and others have taken to social media to share their shock. They tell of 10, 20, or even 30-year careers with unbroken strings of excellent reviews, only to get one surprise terrible review followed promptly by a layoff. No one would challenge that poor performers — people who can't meet basic metrics and who repeatedly fall short despite warnings — are candidates for dismissal. That's exactly why companies use this label. Widespread news of a layoff brands the company as in distress. Companies know that potential candidates for their thousands of open positions would avoid joining a company that just did a layoff. On the other hand, branding a layoff as culling the poor performers looks great. The company is removing dead wood, holding higher standards, and striving to be the best. Rather than looking in distress, it looks aggressive and healthy. High-performance people will seek out companies like this. In addition, terminating people for performance helps avoid a range of potential legal issues. Many notification rules don't apply when performance is the justification. A company can avoid or minimize severance obligations when firing for performance, and many of the discrimination laws could be sidestepped as well. If the performance-based layoff hits older or other protected-class workers disproportionately, the excuse could be, "But their performance." These companies already have built-in mechanisms to identify and remove chronic poor performers. Several of them have quota systems that require a certain percentage of their employees to be labeled in the bottom performance tier. Those employees are routinely removed in what is called "unregretted attrition." But then come these layoffs. Managers at all levels are told to identify poor performers and lay them off. They've already done that for years. Now they may have to find more, and that's often done in a cynical and random fashion. "They've been here forever, how about them?" "Nobody likes them, they can go." or "What have they done for me lately?" That's the haphazard way even good people could get branded as underperforming. Managers don't simply stack rank their team and pull the bottom people — that well is dry. What they do is get together with their peers to try to find the layoff candidates among their ranks. They'll discuss individuals and their accomplishments. The worst possible thing that can happen in that meeting is for the group to promptly agree on you. That might be because of very visible mistakes you've made, disagreements you've fomented, or chaos you've caused. Avoiding the label at that point is difficult or impossible. No one around the table will rush to your defense. But it's just as bad if the group says, "Who?" — for them to be unaware of what you've done and the impact you've had. Your manager might defend you, but without support, you're in trouble. Even decades of hitting KPIs cannot insulate you if you're doing it in isolation. The way to avoid this is to make sure you're well known. Fortunately, there are several ways to do that. Volunteer for visible projects. Offer to be the face of the work outside your team. Make that presentation to the VP. Find ways to highlight your work well outside your immediate team. Volunteer to be the liaison between your team and the groups it's dependent on. Raise your hand to participate in those random companywide initiatives that always come up. Stretch your impact by working for different people, in different groups, in very different parts of the organization — even if they're unusual or off your perceived career track. If you can't actually move to other teams, make connections there. Look for ways to connect with your boss's peers and the people who work for them. Find other people well outside your discipline and reach out. Have a coffee or a Zoom and make a connection — any connection. If you do this well, the managers will move on to someone else, and you'll survive this round of layoffs. Unfortunately, once you've received this label, it's often too late. Even if it seems you've been randomly assigned the label, it's hard to shake it off. Work proactively on becoming well known. Find and make connections with people who are likely to be around that table. At all costs, avoid being the "who?" Chris Williams is a former VP of HR at Microsoft.

Title: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA):A Comprehensive Guide
URL: https://typeforyou.org/the-dow-jones-industrial-average-djiaa-comprehensive-guide/
Time Published: 2025-02-16T09:39:09Z

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), often referred to as “the Dow,” is one of the most widely recognized stock market indices in the world. It serves as a barometer for the overall health of the U.S. stock market and, by extension, the broader economy. This article provides a detailed overview of the DJIA, its history, composition, calculation, significance, and its role in global finance. By the end of this guide, you’ll have a thorough understanding of why the DJIA is a cornerstone of financial markets. The DJIA is a price-weighted index that tracks the performance of 30 large, publicly-owned companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges. These companies are leaders in their respective industries and are considered blue-chip stocks, representing a significant portion of the U.S. economy. The index is maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices, a joint venture between S&P Global, CME Group, and News Corp. Unlike other indices like the S&P 500 or Nasdaq Composite, which are weighted by market capitalization, the DJIA is weighted by the price of its constituent stocks. This means that higher-priced stocks have a greater influence on the index’s movements. The DJIA was created in 1896 by Charles Dow, co-founder of Dow Jones & Company, and his business partner, Edward Jones. Initially, the index included just 12 companies, primarily from industrial sectors such as railroads, cotton, gas, and sugar. The goal was to provide a simple way to gauge the performance of the U.S. stock market. Over time, the index evolved to reflect changes in the economy. By 1928, the DJIA expanded to include 30 companies, a number that remains unchanged today. The composition of the index has also shifted to include companies from a broader range of industries, such as technology, healthcare, and consumer goods. The DJIA is a price-weighted index, meaning that stocks with higher prices have a greater impact on the index’s value. The formula for calculating the DJIA is: DJIA=∑(Prices of the 30 Stocks)DivisorDJIA=Divisor∑(Prices of the 30 Stocks)​ The divisor is a number that adjusts for stock splits, dividends, and other corporate actions to ensure the index remains consistent over time. The divisor is periodically updated to maintain the index’s continuity. For example, if the combined price of the 30 stocks is $5,000 and the divisor is 0.15, the DJIA would be calculated as: DJIA=50000.15=33,333.33DJIA=0.155000​=33,333.33 The DJIA includes 30 companies that are leaders in their industries. These companies are selected by the Averages Committee, which considers factors such as market capitalization, reputation, and sector representation. Some of the well-known companies in the DJIA include: The index is periodically updated to reflect changes in the economy. For example, in 2020, Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell were added to the index, replacing ExxonMobil, Pfizer, and Raytheon Technologies. The DJIA is often used as a proxy for the overall health of the U.S. economy. When the index rises, it is generally interpreted as a sign of economic growth and investor confidence. Conversely, a declining DJIA may indicate economic uncertainty or recession. The DJIA is closely watched by investors, analysts, and policymakers. Movements in the index can influence investor sentiment and drive market trends. As one of the oldest stock market indices, the DJIA provides a historical benchmark for comparing current market performance to past trends. While the DJIA focuses on U.S. companies, its performance has a global impact. Many international investors use the index as a gauge for U.S. market conditions. The S&P 500 includes 500 companies and is weighted by market capitalization, making it a more comprehensive representation of the U.S. stock market. The Nasdaq Composite focuses on technology and growth-oriented companies, with over 3,000 constituents. It is also market-cap weighted. The Russell 2000 tracks small-cap companies, providing insight into the performance of smaller businesses. Investors can gain exposure to the DJIA through: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) remains one of the most influential and widely followed stock market indices in the world. Despite its limitations, it provides valuable insights into the performance of the U.S. economy and serves as a key benchmark for investors. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a beginner, understanding the DJIA is essential for navigating the complexities of the financial markets.

Title: Bitcoin ETF: Abu Dhabi Sovereign Wealth Fund Discloses $437 Million BlackRock Holdings
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/abu-dhabi-sovereign-discloses-bitcoin-etf-holdings/
Time Published: 2025-02-16T07:00:02Z
Full Content:
According to a recent filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund currently holds a significant amount in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund). This purchase came in the final quarter of 2024 after asset management firm BlackRock secured the commercial license to operate in Abu Dhabi last November. On Friday, February 14th, a 13F filing with the SEC revealed that Mubadala Investments purchased $436.9 million of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF shares (with the ticker IBIT). Mubadala Investments is one of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth funds, which makes investments on behalf of the Middle Eastern city’s government. In 2024, the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock — with tens of trillions of dollars under management — disclosed its intentions to expand in the Middle East, focusing on the capital city Abu Dhabi and Riyadh. The recent $437 million purchase of its Bitcoin ETF accentuates BlackRock’s mission to work closely with sovereign wealth funds in the region. Interestingly, this latest acquisition is hardly the first time Abu Dhabi’s government — through its various investment entities — would dabble into cryptocurrencies. In 2023, the Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company and Marathon Digital revealed plans to launch digital asset mining operations in the capital city. Interestingly, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has also enjoyed a fair share of domestic attention in the United States. On Friday, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board also reported an increased exposure to the premier cryptocurrency through the exchange-traded fund. According to the filing with the SEC, Wisconsin’s pension fund now holds around $321 million in spot Bitcoin ETFs. This represents an estimated 100% increase from the board’s $164 million BTC ETF holdings (previously reported in May 2024). As of the last filing, the Wisconsin pension fund held approximately 2.4 million (worth approximately $100 million) shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and 1 million shares (valued at $64 million) of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). However, the latest filing shows that the pension fund has allocated all of its BTC exposure into BlackRock’s exchange-traded fund and no longer holds any shares of GBTC. It is worth noting that the price of Bitcoin has grown by nearly 70% since May 2024. As of this writing, the premier cryptocurrency is valued at around $97,250, reflecting a mere 1% increase in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the Bitcoin price is up by roughly 90% in the past year. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Business cannot thrive on radically transparent blockchains
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/business-cannot-thrive-on-radically-transparent-blockchains/
Time Published: 2025-02-16T06:00:33Z

For millennia, businesses have relied on a careful balance of confidentiality and transparency to operate, unless we fix that balance, enterprises won’t adopt blockchains, says Matthew Niemerg of Aleph Zero. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The following is a guest post by Matthew Niemerg, Co-founder of Aleph Zero. In the grand halls of Florence’s Palazzo Medici, during the Renaissance, the legendary banking family conducted their affairs with an intricate dance of transparency and secrecy. While their ledgers tracked every florin with meticulous precision, access to these records was guarded as carefully as the gold in their vaults. This delicate balance between accountability and confidentiality wasn’t just good business—it was essential for survival in the complex web of Renaissance politics and commerce. Five centuries later, as blockchains are innovating both finance and business, we appear at risk of forgetting that fundamental lesson. The idea that all transactions should be permanently visible on public ledgers isn’t just naive—it’s catastrophic for business adoption. Consider a modern manufacturer negotiating with suppliers. In traditional banking, while transactions are verified and recorded, the details remain confidential—known only to the parties involved and their financial institutions. Now, imagine conducting these same negotiations on a public blockchain where every payment, every contract term, and every business relationship is visible to competitors, customers, and market manipulators. It’s equivalent to forcing businesses to publish their entire accounts payable and receivable in real-time, complete with transaction amounts and counterparty identities. Transparency should mean verifying that transactions follow agreed-upon rules, not exposing every business decision to public scrutiny. Just as Netscape’s introduction of SSL in the 1990s made e-commerce viable by securing online transactions, blockchain networks need robust privacy mechanisms to achieve mainstream business adoption. In a 2020 McKinsey survey, healthcare and financial services achieved the highest score for trust from consumers. Both industries are also two of the key adopters of blockchain. Without secure and confidential infrastructure, these sectors risk eroding the very trust they’ve spent decades building. A doctor’s prescription, a patient’s treatment plan, or a company’s financial restructuring can’t be broadcast to the world on a public ledger—no matter how secure the verification mechanism might be. The stakes are even higher today. As businesses consider moving more operations on-chain—from supply chain management to intellectual property licensing—the need for confidentiality becomes acute. A pharmaceutical company developing a breakthrough drug can’t risk exposing its research investments through transparent blockchain transactions. A retail chain shouldn’t broadcast its inventory management strategies to competitors through visible smart contracts. Moreover, the permanent nature of blockchain records amplifies privacy concerns. In traditional systems, historical transaction data eventually becomes less accessible. But on public blockchains, every transaction remains visible forever—creating an indelible record that could reveal business strategies, pricing patterns, and relationship networks to future competitors or adversaries. The solution isn’t to abandon blockchain technology’s promise of improved verification and automation. Instead, we must embed privacy into these systems from the ground up. Zero-knowledge cryptography offers a pathway, allowing transactions to be verified without revealing their contents. This technology could enable businesses to leverage blockchain’s benefits while maintaining essential confidentiality. Some blockchain purists might protest that this approach contradicts the technology’s founding principles of transparency. But they misread history. Bitcoin’s innovation wasn’t in making all transactions public—it was in solving the double-spending problem without requiring trust in a central authority. Privacy-preserving technologies can maintain this trustless verification while protecting sensitive business information. The two are not mutually exclusive. The history of banking privacy, from ancient temples to modern Swiss banks, demonstrates that confidentiality isn’t antithetical to trust—it’s essential for it. Temples’ religious role gave them a reputation for integrity and discretion. Likewise, the Medicis didn’t survive and thrive for centuries by broadcasting their clients’ financial affairs to all of Florence. They succeeded by innovating a double-entry bookkeeping system that kept client information accurate and private, ensuring trust through discretion. As we architect the future of business on blockchain networks, we must learn from this history. The next generation of blockchain protocols must incorporate privacy as a fundamental feature, not an afterthought. Zero-knowledge proofs, confidential smart contracts, and private transaction pools aren’t just technical innovations—they’re essential building blocks for practical business adoption. The stakes extend beyond individual privacy concerns to the very architecture of our future financial systems. Without robust privacy solutions, public blockchains risk pushing enterprises toward private, permissioned networks—a trend we’re already seeing. JPMorgan’s Kinexys platform and the Hyperledger-based networks used by Walmart and Maersk for supply chain management demonstrate how major corporations are choosing controlled environments over public infrastructure. While these private networks serve immediate business needs, they fragment the blockchain ecosystem and limit the network effects that make public chains so powerful. Much like how corporate intranets in the early internet era eventually gave way to the public web once security measures matured, public blockchains need privacy-preserving technologies to avoid being sidelined by enterprise-specific solutions. Thankfully, this remains a limited trend, as major corporations like Ubisoft, BlackRock, and Warner Music Group continue to use public blockchains for their business use cases. However, this progress could reverse unless chains build confidentiality into their core infrastructure. The Renaissance bankers understood that privacy wasn’t about hiding misdeeds—it was about creating the trust and security necessary for commerce to flourish. As value increasingly moves onchain, we would do well to remember their wisdom.

We need your help now Support from readers like you keeps The Journal open. You are visiting us because we have something you value. Independent, unbiased news that tells the truth. Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. SCAM ADVERTISEMENTS THAT use artificial intelligence to masquerade as independent shops in Ireland are continuing to run online, despite previous complaints about similar cons. The ads, various versions of which are running on Meta platforms Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, appeal to the consumer’s sympathy, citing financial hardship, break-ins or tragic fires as the reason for the closure of the ‘family-run’ stores. One shop, ‘Walsh Kildare’, has multiple ads running. One claims they are closing down because of a recent fire, while another says they’re closing because of a break-in. The websites the ads link to are only a few months old and people who have purchased from them say the goods are cheap and come from China, not Ireland. It’s a new take on scam ads that have been around for months, where text and images are generated by artificial intelligence, some with more convincing results than others. An ad for 'Walsh Kildare', which claims to be closing down after a break in Some of the ads have obvious AI generated images. This can be identified by dramatic imagery, bad spelling on signs and inconsistent details. Other ads use generic stock photos of shops, people and clothing. An Instagram story for Aidens Kildare that has a 'closure sale' sign spelled incorrectly Instagram Instagram When you search for the shops on Google, no physical store shows up. They also don’t have a physical address on the website. When looking at the Facebook pages that posted the ads, you can see under ‘page transparency’ that they’re not moderated from an Irish location, but rather countries such as the United States and Vietnam. Users can report ads they believe violate Meta’s policies by clicking the three dots in the upper right hand corner of the ad. The scams go against Meta’s rules. It claims it doesn’t “allow advertisers to run ads that promote products, services, schemes or offers that use identified deceptive or misleading practices, including scams to take money from people or access personal information”. Meta declined to comment on the continuous presence of the ads on its platforms. An Instagram ad for 'Byrne Cork'. There is no store with this name in Cork Aidens Kildare is another fake shop that is “closing down”. Its site, aidenskildare.com, was created less than five months ago, according to a domain age checker. Advertisement The quality of the clothing has been described as “dire” on Trustpilot, and several people say they waited months for a refund, or weren’t given one at all. On Trustpilot, where customers can leave reviews of companies, 97% of people gave “Aidan’s Kildare” a 1-star rating (the lowest one can give), with several customers accusing the shop of scamming. “Total scammers!! You will receive junk from China,” they wrote. “They say you can keep item and they’ll give you 30% off next purchase! When you finally get a return address it’s in China and you have to pay to return, and even with tracking, they say they haven’t received it.” Another unhappy customer wrote: ”Avoid this store when you see advert on Facebook or elsewhere!!! Bloody scammers pretending to be an Irish company. “Took 1 month for sub standard jackets to arrive from China. My arms couldn’t even get through the ill- fitted cheap quality clothes.” One customer said Aidan’s Kildare is “false advertising”, as there’s “no such shop in Kildare”. 'Moda Kildare' website, which is four months old Moda Kildare is another shop that operates using the same scamming techniques. Its logo has the colours of the Irish flag underneath it, but customers say it’s not based in Ireland at all. Its website was created only four months ago, and reviews report it selling “cheap crap” at a relatively high price. The fake websites are an example of dropshipping, where a seller accepts orders without keeping stock on hand or having a physical shop. The seller transfers the orders and their shipment details either to the manufacturer, a wholesaler, another retailer, or a fulfillment house, which then ships the goods directly to the customer. The Journal previously asked the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) about what a person should do if they think they have been duped by one of these websites. The commission said that anyone who believes they have been scammed should immediately contact their bank or credit card issuer, who can place their account and card on hold while they investigate the problem. Anyone who has been caught by a scam should contact Gardaí, who have advice about online shopping fraud and how to avoid scams on their website. Coimisiún na Meán, which regulates online platforms in Ireland, also said that when users discover something that they think is illegal or against a platform’s rules, they should report it to the relevant platform. If a person can’t find a way to do this or if they’re unhappy with how the platform has responded to them, they can contact the commission.

Title: Owning its own home pays for Fine Gael when it comes to funding elections
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2025/02/16/overheard-owning-its-own-home-pays-for-fine-gael-when-it-comes-to-funding-elections/

When it comes to financing elections, it pays to be a property owner, rather than a renter. Land registry records show that Fine Gael remortgaged its headquarters at 51 Upper Mount Street last September with Bank of Ireland to raise money for its election war chest. The party previously did the same thing in 2011, reportedly raising about €2.5 million ahead of that year’s general election. This time it raised €1.5 million, it said this weekend. While we have to wait for the Standards in Public Office (Sipo) to tell us how much each party spent on the recent European, local and general elections, we already know because of EU digital transparency rules that Fine Gael spent the most in the run-up to the general election with the various social-media giants. All parties and candidates spent about €870,000 combined, with Simon Harris’s party accounting for about €280,000 of the total, including more than €100,000 in the final two days of the campaign. The next highest spender was Fianna Fáil, which handed over €170,000 to Zuckerberg, Musk et al over the course of the campaign. Fianna Fáil doesn’t have a blue-chip office to remortgage to raise funds for the glut of elections we’ve had in recent months, not to mention a presidential election to come before the end of the year. In 2001 it had to sell its base of 70 years on Upper Mount Street to clear a party debt of €1 million to financial institutions. Since then it has been renting another office at 65-66 Lower Mount Street, paying “dead money” to its landlord, the National Maternity Hospital. Beneath the fake tan and tiaras, the Rose of Tralee is a hot mess – at least financially. Records released under the Freedom of Information Act show the organisers of the pageant are keeping their outfit together with the equivalent of a safety pin. Last year Anthony O’Gara, the festival’s managing director, asked Kerry County Council to secure the future of the pageant by becoming its exclusive lead sponsor. O’Gara said that every year the festival’s goodwill was “divided among competing commercial interests that have little or no connection to Kerry – our proposition is that we should change that”. The council was offered a judge on the jury, the council’s brand on the rose’s sashes and more events taking place in Kerry. But instead of becoming its lead sponsor, the council contributed only €50,000 directly to the festival last year, down from the €120,000 it has traditionally given. It spent the balance on an accompanying street carnival in Tralee, which used to be paid for by the festival. The records released show O’Gara pulled out of hosting the street festival in 2023, saying he had to focus on securing the “core elements” of the annual pageant. Also gone since 2022 is the Rose Ball, a dinner dance featuring the roses and their escorts, which O’Gara said lost more than €100,000 in its last year. In 2023 the festival lost €72,321, according to its most recent accounts, brining its total liabilities to €320,984. It’s also facing two separate legal actions by American shareholder Richard Henggeler, who wants a loan made by him to the festival to be repaid immediately. Yet O’Gara remains confident this year’s event will come up smelling of roses. This weekend he said the pageant “returned a small profit last year and we are confident that the festival will continue to flourish”. Businessman Dermot Desmond gave his blessing to plans for a new clubhouse at Wanderers FC on Merrion Road when the rugby club applied for planning permission for a swanky new two-storey pavilion with a bar, gym, changing rooms and a physio room four years ago. Desmond said the upgrade would “benefit the entire community”. “It is great to have clubs like Old Belvedere RFC and Wanderers – the second-oldest rugby club in Ireland – in such a residential area, providing excellent playing fields for senior, junior and underage teams,” he said in a letter supporting the club’s application. Dublin City Council approved the plans but the tricky conversion has been on hold since. The council asked Wanderers for a €180,000 contribution towards local infrastructure. Wanderers argued it should be exempt given it is a not-for-profit organisation. Last week An Bord Pleanála finally sided with the council, ruling that Wanderers had failed to prove it would not “accrue some profit or gain” from the enhanced facilities. If only Wanderers knew a sympathetic billionaire. Former rugby players Jamie Heaslip, Seán O’Brien, and brothers Rob and Dave Kearney have been expanding their pub empire with businessman Noel Anderson. Last year, for €5.5 million, they added McSorley’s in Ranelagh to their other Dublin watering holes: Lemon & Duke, The Bridge 1859, The Blackrock and Little Lemon. They have christened their pub chain Grand Slam Bars, sticking in a trademark for the name late last year. Unfortunately for the guys, Perry Ellis International, a clothing company that specialises in golf and tennis wear, cried foul, saying they were breaching its European trademark for the name “grand slam”. Anderson said this weekend an agreement had been reached with the company. The pub chain can use the phrase Grand Slam Bars and even sell merchandise – as long as they stick to rugby-themed clobber. Last week we reported how White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt took aim at USAid funding a concert by Other Voices at the US ambassador’s residence in Ireland in 2022 called Dignity: Towards a More Equitable Future, which we mistakenly said was also funded by Rethink Ireland. Word reaches us that then Minister for Equality Roderic O’Gorman attended a separate event before the concert which included panel discussions on topics such as barriers to inclusion. While that event was organised by Rethink Ireland, it was funded by a €32,000 grant from the US embassy. Let’s hope it’s not on the pugnacious Leavitt’s radar. The Seanad has had its fair share of drones over the years. Now it has its first beekeeper. Fine Gael’s PJ Murphy, elected to the Seanad’s Agricultural panel, runs Ardrahan Apiary in Co Galway, which has more than 70 hives. Murphy, who is also a farmer, produces all kinds of natural honey, including soft set ivy honey made using nectar from the flowers of the ivy plant. A previous member of the Seanad, Vincent P Martin, once suggested setting up a beehive on Leinster Lawn. If it happens in this Seanad term, they have the very man for the job. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: ‘I cried for two days solid’ – Keith Barry on the grief of his father’s death from lung cancer

Keith Barry Magician and entertainer Keith Barry has opened up about his experience with grief following the death of his father, who he described as “my best friend”. Ken Barry died “peacefully” last month at Our Lady's Hospice and Care Services in Blackrock, Dublin following a battle with stage four lung cancer. “He was the best dad and my best friend as well as being my dad. When he passed away it was painful,” he said, speaking on RTÉ’s Sunday with Miriam. Barry described his father as well-known, a “real gregarious character” and the life and soul of the party, who was “always the last man to bed”. His father was one of the co-founders of Tipperary Crystal, as well as Smart Telecom and featured on the Late Late Show a number of of times. He was also a judge in the Rose of Tralee for a number of years. While remembering his father as a “great man for the whole of my life”, the mentalist stressed their relationship growing up “wasn’t without strains”. Keith Barry Today's News in 90 seconds - 16th February 2025 The family, comprising of Keith, his sister Michelle, mother Kitty and father Ken, grew up on a country road in Williamstown, Waterford, living on a third of an acre, with animals, BMX bicycles and the space to enjoy all the delights of rural, country Ireland. "But when I was 15 to 18, my relationship with my dad was a bit strained. Looking back... it was probably all me, and you don't think of that at the time, but it was just probably a teenager acting out and then he reacted to that. “So it was strange for a couple of years, but then something magical happened when I was 18, 19, 20. I was in college, so I would see him every kind of weekend and ultimately our bond just really forged together,” he said. He added that his father was “my confidant, my mentor, my advisor”, who was also “one of the lads”. Up until his father’s passing last month. His father would join Barry and his friends on fishing trips. He said it was almost strange at the funeral. "My friends weren't turning up to console me, they were turning up because they had lost one of their friends in my Dad, you know,” he said. Despite not being a smoker, Barry said his father got lung cancer and was very sick for the last two years, and he and his mother ultimately became his carer. He described that period as “really difficult” as he neither he nor his father really wanted him to be his carer. "He was ready to to pass away and then when he did, ultimately, I was strong through it all. And then I cried for two days solid and that grief kind of overwhelmed me,” he said. However, two days later, that feeling “lifted” and he began to think of his father with a smile, magnifying the positive experiences they had together. “I feel guilty almost some days for not grieving more because I grieved hard and fast. I actually feel quite good at the moment. And and there's certainly a lot of guilt with that. "You wonder. Jesus, should I be crying more? Should I feel sad? I am sure that down the line it'll come back and get me,” he said. He added that the last rugby match for Ireland, was difficult, as his Dad would usually belt out the national anthem when they went to watch it together. However, although difficult to watch his father hooked up to machines in St James Hospital at the end of his life, he is glad he got to say goodbye. “I even got to ask him, ‘Dad, what kind of funeral do you want? Do you want an open casket? A closed casket?’ “That was a hard conversation to have with him and then the hard part is him telling me, ‘look after your mum, look after your sister’. It was tough. "I think it was important for him to know when he was passing. But look, I'll look after mum. She'll be fine. Me and my sister will be fine and it's OK to to pass on to wherever you think you're going,” he told his father. Non-religious, his father asked for three things: no religious service, that everyone wears bright colours and that there is a big party afterwards. “We turned up at Mount Jerome and it was a bit weird. There was a funeral in one of the buildings across from us. They were having a traditional funeral, wearing black and it was quite sombre. And then you look right next to them. “We were all in bright colours, we looked like we were going to a nightclub in Ibiza. So we honoured it,” he said. Since his father’s passing, his mother has comes to stay with Barry’s family two or three nights per week, after losing her partner of 56 years. “I think the most important thing is just surrounding yourself with positive people and people who are willing to give their time and just sit with that person and talk to them. There’s plenty of people around mum that will sit with her and just help her through this difficult time,” he said. “So yeah, look, we'll do our best and I'll be there for her as well as my wife, you know, and our two kids as well will help with the distraction.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Before and after: transforming a vacant Blackrock bakery into a luxury downsizer home

Familiar to generations living locally, Bennett’s Bakery shop on Blackrock’s main street garnered a huge amount of attention when it first came to market in 2021 with an AMV of €375,000. It had no heating of any sort, nor was there a screed of insulation. It needed rewiring, replumbing, new windows and a bathroom. Its conversion needed a knowledgeable approach. It first sold to an Irish person overseas, who then realised that the project was too large to undertake from afar, according to the selling agent DNG. The 68sq m (732sq ft) property went back on the market, and it was at this stage a retiree living on his own in a four-bedroom semi off Mount Merrion Avenue spotted it. He was looking to trade down. A building engineer, with the knowledge and experience to tackle the job, the new owner also had a bulging contacts book of talented tradesmen to execute the refurbishment. “I had considered downsizing to an apartment but couldn’t find anything nice,” he says. “It (the bakery) was so central. I knew I could get a second space in for the grandchildren to come and stay.” He was also, as he says, “looking for a bit of wow factor”. And he has found it in spades here; that is, after the serious renovation works. He paid €470,00 for the former bakery in May 2022, according to the property price register, and ploughed in about the same amount again to do it up. The Bennett’s signage remains, but the grey concrete render is gone. Its warm red brick facade is now expertly repointed. Inside, the result is a warm and toasty abode, with everything the village of Blackrock has to offer on his doorstep. He is in the heart of the action, surrounded by 34 coffee shops, restaurants, bars and cafes, according to his count, rather than being on his own in a semi in suburbia. “By making the move I have freed up a family home,” he says. The one-way glass in the front room window allows him to watch what is going on outside without being seen. [ How to establish your own interior design styleOpens in new window ] “Being able to look out and watch the world go by is a beautiful experience,” he says. The odd passerby, however, remains intrigued enough to literally cup their hands against the glass to try to peer in. “I think they think it’s a shop,” he says. It’s happened enough times that he is now considering putting a discreet sign up to say it is a private residence. And intriguing it is. He rejigged the layout in favour of an open-plan approach downstairs. Large format porcelain tiles are warmed by underfloor heating. He doesn’t have a Ber for the building, but says the insulation levels in the walls, floor and ceilings are high. The heating is gas, which he puts on for two hours in the morning and he doesn’t need to switch it on again. An electric flame-effect fire from Buckley’s Fireplaces brings in visual warmth. There’s a bathroom on each floor. It’s a man cave with some retiree add-ons. Marine blue is used on bespoke shelving, the window box that surrounds the triple-glazing and on the full-height cabinet doors that conceal kitchen units to the rear of the room. There’s bold floral wallpaper on two of the walls with a double height mirror wall reflecting the room into antiqued mirror-back shelving. A transparent glass spiral staircase, which feels a lot more solid underfoot than it looks, climbs up through the floors. He first spotted this design at a building exhibition. The space is youthful and fun and very much suited to his personality. He’s a ‘why not?’ kind of guy. But he’s also future-proofed it. “Being able to put a lift in was important,” he says, for he has a bad knee. [ How to plan home improvement projects to avoid delays and keep your timeline on trackOpens in new window ] So, adjacent to the stairs is a pod housing a pneumatic vacuum lift that can transport him to the principal bedroom above, and on up to the attic space on the second floor in a jiffy. It’s an innovative self-supporting structure that requires no excavation to accommodate it or the hoist way and machine room that help it function. Installation is directly on to the existing floor. In the case of a power cut, the moving car automatically descends to the lowest level. He says it cost about €50,000 to import and install and he has it serviced twice a year. While the interior is bold and contemporary, homage is paid to the property’s Victorian origins. The most obvious example is the very decorative cornice, actually three different cornices layered together, supplied by The Old Mould Company, with recessed strip lighting to the rear. It was inspired by a hotel visit. Living over the shop or in a converted shop is a way of life on mainland Europe. Here, it could help repopulate our town and village centres. This is a good thing; however, the conversion work takes time and money. This restoration should become a model for shops and buildings lying derelict in towns and villages across the country. If restored, they could accommodate many homeowners We need mavericks willing to spend both to demonstrate the different ways it can be done. There are lots of people willing to give it a go, but finding the pockets deep enough to execute the dream is more difficult. Would he recommend it as an option to others trading down? In a word, yes. “I was able to do it because it was my job, but for ordinary buyers you need architects and engineers, adding to costs,” he says. Fire regulations also need to be considered. “I was okay as I had a rear access.” But the upside far outweighs the difficulties. “The main benefit is location,” he says. “You’re in the heart of it once you go out your front door, with shops and restaurants all around. “This restoration should become a model for shops and buildings lying derelict in towns and villages across the country. If restored, they could accommodate many homeowners.” As a route to home ownership, acquiring a building that was formerly in commercial use is one that appeals to those looking for something a little different – but oftentimes, the properties need a lot of work. The key issue is access to adequate funds to purchase the property and do the work. [ Luxury apartment life above the shop in the heart of Dún Laoghaire for €675,000Opens in new window ] “The problem for home hunters hoping to buy a commercial property that you want to use for residential is that the bank won’t lend to you,” Orla McMorrow, deputy chief executive of the DNG Group, the agency that sold the bakery property, explains. “It won’t issue a residential mortgage.” As such, vendors of such properties should go for change of use planning permission before bringing the property to the market, she says. “Otherwise, you will restrict your buyer profile to cash buyers.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

On January 2nd, I made a bold prediction in Forbes that Airbnb would change the way we travel in 2025. And on Valentine’s Day Airbnb’s stock surged 14% in a single day. For a larger travel brand that’s an unusual jump in market capitalization. NEW YORK - JUNE 7: Tourists take pictures June 7, 2012 of the Wall Street bull several blocks from ... [+] the New York Stock Exchange in New York City. (Photo by Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images) Can AI allow consumers increased access to localize their journey? You bet. It can increase the total size of the travel pie and potentially enable consumers to shift more easily from one brand to another. According to Kayak’s CEO Steve Hafner, 2025 is expected to witness a pivotal shift where the first successful commercial agreement between an AI engine and a major travel player could act like "a dam breaking." Disruptor brands have the potential to take share as the adoption of new technology increases access. According to NerdWallet, Marriott is one of the best known loyalty brands in the world. I’ll confess I have been a heavy Marriott user and so are millions of Marriott loyalists. With over 210 Million members in the aggregate their size in numbers would approximate the country of Brazil which is the 7th largest country in the world. Brazil’s population and Marriott’s membership are similar. But am I truly loyal? I stay at Marriott on probably 80% or more of my travel. I am paying for that with a company credit card or rebilling my clients. My stays are usually 1-3 nights and the brand nearly always delivers a great customer experience in a location that matters a lot at a price point that is less important. I don’t want to overspend but I have relatively high price elasticity. What happens when I want to stay somewhere 4-7 nights and don’t require the restaurant and pool at the hotel? I am paying for all of the overhead at the hotel I really like. If I’m staying longer and want to explore the local environment the location matters just as much but the price starts to become a bigger factor. TEL AVIV, ISRAEL - JANUARY 24: An Israeli man uses the Vivino wine app on his Samsung mobile phone ... [+] to find out more information about the wine being served at a tasting of wines from France's southern Rhone region on January 24, 2018 near Tel Aviv, Israel. Vivino calls itself the world’s most popular wine community and most downloaded mobile wine app with 28 million users contribute ratings for millions of wines from around the globe to create the largest wine library in the world. The wine is Domaine d'Ouréa winery's Gigondas 2015 vintage, a blend of 90% Grenache and 10% Syrah grapes. (Photo by David Silverman/Getty Images) My thesis is a bit different than many on Airbnb. As a strategy and innovation professional I like to look at brand permission. A brief explanation on brand permission is “would consumers trust your brand and how far will that trust extend?” When you innovate on need states, use cases, palette states, dayparts or other factors specific to travel, brand permission becomes a critical factor. For example, I may trust Nike to introduce a new running shoe or even apparel, but I may not consider Nike if they create a financial planning service. Nike’s brand permission is high and certainly allows them to move from athletic shoes to apparel and even to hard goods. But it doesn’t mean Nike can just open a bank, operate an airplane or buy a beer brand that their raving fans will trust. In the case of a younger consumer, Gen Z often looks at the following factors related to travel and travel lodging: “AI can help travelers quickly sort through their preferences and seamlessly stitch together what has traditionally been a very siloed experience into a cohesive plan,” said Mindtrip CEO Andy Moss. “In 2025, this capability will be supercharged as we enter the early days of agentic booking and voice-to-voice interactions, making anything possible.” I love brands that have the potential to create an unfair advantage. Think about brands that often create unfair advantage by building a more unique business model: Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Chewy and others. Brands that have more indirect competitors and fewer direct competitors often fit the category of “unfair advantage.” So while I’m open to the idea of couch surfing to save a lot on my lodging expense I haven’t pursued it in my decades of business and leisure travel. My alternatives are largely hotels, VRBO or Airbnb. I think it would be super inexpensive to couch surf. I also absolutely relish a stay at a Ritz Carlton but would I stay for a week if the cost was materially different, I’m paying for it and the location was materially the same as the indirect alternatives? In my view, Airbnb will create high value-added partnerships that are both innovative and align to the brands value proposition. Imagine if Airbnb could help you: Airbnb doesn’t have to build out all the technology, but they have to “localize” the brand and help the consumer achieve a better experience, save them a little time, put a few extra bucks in their pocket and have a more local and authentic experience. "Airbnb has a unique opportunity in that their brand is ultimately 'controlled’ by more than 5 million hosts. This gives them the opportunity to win or lose based on how well they deliver on their brand promise and localize the experience. As we move into more shared brand models, this will become crucial." Nancy A Shenker, Publisher of BleisureLiving.com. “Our strong Q4 results are a testament to a ton of hard work from our teams,” remarked Dave Stephenson Airbnb Chief Business Officer. I think in addition to hard work Airbnb has built an unfair advantage that will appeal to discretionary, leisure travelers. Time will tell but I’d bet on Airbnb’s ability to leverage their brand permission as well as localize the consumer journey. With the AI tail winds creating a bigger travel pie as well as increased access for tech savvy consumers, we may be hearing from Airbnb again.

It’s the first blockchain explicitly designed for exchanges, giving them a special advantage. SEI can handle a huge number of orders every second, and transactions are finalized in just 380 milliseconds. Big institutions help keep it secure, a top priority for SEI. What does this mean? Some say SEI’s value could soar by over 300% by 2030. Its focus on speed and security sets it apart from other coins. SEI stands out in today’s market, where quick and safe trading is key. While other coins offer different features, SEI’s trading specialization makes it unique. It could be an attractive option in the current market cycle. Keep an eye on SEI as it might be the next big thing in blockchain trading. Ondo Finance is changing the way people access high-quality products.

The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) appears to have reduced its exposure to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund while adding to its position in Blackrock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF. A new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicates SWIB holds 6,060,351 shares of BlackRock’s IBIT. With the fund trading at $55.33 at time of writing, that means SWIB’s IBIT exposure currently stands at more than $335.3 million. In a previous filing back in May, SWIB reported owning only 2,450,400 shares of IBIT. However, the May filing indicated the investment board also held 1,013,000 shares of Grayscale’s BTC ETF (GBTC), which were collectively worth around $57 million at the time. In filings submitted in November and this week, SWIB didn’t disclose any GBTC holdings. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board is a state agency managing investments for public retirement and trust funds. It has diversified investments, including cryptocurrency, Coinbase, Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms, Block, Cipher Mining, Cleanspark, Microstrategy and other traditional financial vehicles. IBIT is the largest Bitcoin ETF, with $56.38 billion worth of assets under management (AUM), according to data from Coinglass. Fidelity’s FBTC is second with $20.19 billion in AUM, and GBTC ranks third, with $19.28 billion. The SEC greenlit the first spot market Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, bringing in billions of dollars worth of inflows to the top digital asset by market cap. The regulator subsequently approved Ethereum (ETH) ETFs for trading in July. Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin told employees Thursday it would lay off about 10% of its workforce.The company has more than 10,000 employees, with a major presence on the Space Coast at its rocket factory adjacent Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex where it constructs its New Glenn rocket. The rocker had a successful debut launch last month.The number of positions that would be affected in Florida was not announced, but it also has major operations in Alabama, Texas and Washington where the company is headquartered.In a letter to employees obtained by the Orlando Sentinel sent by company CEO Dave Limp, he said much of the workforce reduction was due to excessive management built up over the last few years.“Our primary focus in 2025 and beyond is to scale our manufacturing output and launch cadence with speed, decisiveness, and efficiency for our customers,” Limp wrote.That would include more buildup of its New Glenn rockets that launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station’s Launch Complex 36, but also its smaller suborbital New Shepard rocket from Texas. The company also designs and will build its new Blue Moon lunar lander at its Brevard County facilities.“We grew and hired incredibly fast in the last few years, and with that growth came more bureaucracy and less focus than we needed,” Limp said. “It also became clear that the makeup of our organization must change to ensure our roles are best aligned with executing these priorities.”He said the layoffs meant eliminating some engineering, research and development, and “thinning out our layers of management.” Limp, a former Amazon executive, took over the CEO role in late 2023. At the time, the company said it had $10 billion in customer orders and more than 10,000 employees.He said affected employees would be notified by Thursday morning while employees being retained would also receive an email confirming their continued employment.Despite the layoffs, Limp said the company would actually continue to hire hundreds of positions to support the programs where it will remain focused.“Let me add that I am extremely confident in the enormous opportunities in front of us and have never been more optimistic about our mission,” he said. “We will be a stronger, faster, and more customer-focused company that consistently meets and exceeds our commitments.”He said 2025 remains bullish with a planned mission to land on the moon with a test version of Blue Moon and flying more New Glenn and New Shepard missions.New Glenn is looking to become certified by Space Force so it can compete for lucrative national security missions.

New filings show that the Abu Dhabi Sovereign Wealth Fund has accumulated hundreds of millions of dollars worth of BlackRock’s Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF). According to new filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the wealth fund has stockpiled about $455 million worth of the asset management giant’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). The United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) wealth fund was established in 1976 to promote economic stability and prosperity for the nation. In December, Reuters reported that the fund became the world’s top wealth fund spender, passing Saudi Arabia. Since its launch in January 2024, IBIT has become the largest ETF by market cap based on the flagship digital asset. In November, it was found that IBIT surpassed its gold counterpart in terms of net assets despite BlackRock’s gold ETF launching nearly two decades earlier. According to a recent Bloomberg report, BlackRock secured its commercial license to operate in Abu Dhabi just last year and said it did so to work more closely with sovereign wealth funds, wealth managers and investment vehicles in the area. As stated by Charles Hatami, head of the Middle East for BlackRock, to Bloomberg, “Abu Dhabi has rapidly transformed into a global financial center. Its strategic location, proactive government policies, and commitment to sustainable growth make it an ideal location for capital markets.” IBIT is trading for $55.41 at time of writing, a 1.2% increase during the last 24 hours.

The Middle East, specifically the Gulf, might be ahead of the United States in terms of adoption. Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala Investments, is now the 7th largest holder of BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, with a $461M investment in Q4 2024. Since it is one of the Emirates of the UAE, this news has intensified the initial speculation that Abu Dhabi might have as much as $40 billion in Bitcoin holdings. Source: Bloomberg Commenting on this update, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted, “The rumors were not just rumors!” Interestingly, the UAE has never officially shared or notified its BTC stash. According to Binance founder CZ, the reported $461M BTC holding could be just the tip of the iceberg for AD alone. He stated, “This report is just from one of the Sovereign Wealth Funds (Mubadala) in AD. There are a few other SWFs in AD.” According to David Bailey, CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, Abu Dhabi has more holdings than stated and other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members are now jumping on the trend. He stated, “Abu Dhabi has gone in much bigger than today’s filing. There’s a couple other GCC members that are making moves too. Was hoping this would be announced at BitcoinMENA but they weren’t ready.” The update has increased calls for the U.S to establish or include a National BTC Reserve in President Trump’s recently announced sovereign wealth fund (SWF). In fact, Bailey also speculated that President Trump’s Commerce Secretary pick, Howard Lutnick, could follow the UAE’s steps and include BTC in the United States’ SWF. Source: X A similar call was made by the Bitcoin Policy Institute, an advocacy group for the cryptocurrency. Part of the group’s report read, “The U.S could use the ~200,000 BTC already in U.S. federal custody from law enforcement seizures to allocate these holdings as seed capital for the SWF without requiring new taxpayer funding.” Worth pointing out, however, that such a move is still massively underpriced by the market, going by Polymarket’s latest odds. In fact, at the time of writing, the predictions site was pricing the possibility at a mere 14% by summer 2025. Source: Polymarket That being said, despite the bullish updates and apparent ‘nation-state’ moves on Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency remained muted at press time. It has struggled below $100k for ten days now, with the crypto valued at $97k or 12% from its ATH at press time.

Title: Nvidia Earnings: What To Know About The Stock Before The Upcoming Report
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/nvidia-earnings-what-to-know-stock-report-q1-2025/
Time Published: 2025-02-15T18:00:00Z

While recent developments have introduced some uncertainty, the fundamental drivers of Nvidia's ... [+] growth remain robust. As the world’s largest semiconductor company prepares to release its fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 (ending January 31, 2025) results post-market close on February 26, 2025, all eyes are on Nvidia Corporation (NVDA). With a staggering market capitalization of $3.4 trillion, the Santa Clara-based tech giant has become synonymous with the AI revolution, transforming from a gaming-focused GPU maker into a full-stack computing powerhouse reshaping global industries. The upcoming earnings report comes at a crucial time for Nvidia, as investors seek clarity on whether the company can maintain its extraordinary growth trajectory amid emerging competition and evolving market dynamics. This analysis explores what investors should know before this pivotal earnings announcement. The artificial intelligence landscape witnessed significant shifts in early 2025, marked by the emergence of new players and technological breakthroughs. One of the most notable developments has been the rise of the Chinese research lab DeepSeek, which demonstrated the ability to train competitive AI models at a fraction of the traditional computing power requirements, challenging conventional assumptions about AI infrastructure needs. Despite these disruptions, major tech companies have doubled their AI investments. Industry giants like Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) have announced record-breaking capital expenditure plans for 2025, with Meta planning to spend up to $65 billion on AI infrastructure (up from $39.2 billion last year), Alphabet projecting $75 billion in capital expenditures. Amazon potentially exceeds $100 billion in AI-related investments Nvidia’s stock has demonstrated remarkable strength, surging 136.7% over the past 52 weeks and significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Index's 25% gain and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's 17.9% return. However, the stock trades approximately 11% below its early January 2025 record high, following concerns about DeepSeek's technological breakthrough. The company's financial performance has been equally impressive, with its most recent quarterly results showcasing the tremendous demand for AI computing solutions. In fiscal Q3 2025, Nvidia reported record Data Center revenue of $30.8 billion, representing a 112% year-over-year increase. Total revenues reached an all-time high of $35.1 billion, up 93.6% from the previous year, while net income grew by 108.9% to $19.3 billion. Current market sentiment remains decisively positive, with 36 out of 43 analysts maintaining "Strong Buy" ratings on the stock. The mean price target of $176.55 suggests a potential 25.4% upside from current levels, reflecting continued optimism about Nvidia’s growth prospects. The primary catalyst driving Nvidia's outlook continues to be the unprecedented demand for AI computing infrastructure. The company's latest Blackwell architecture, particularly the GB200 NVL72 system, offers performance capabilities that are 30 times faster than previous generations for AI inference tasks, positioning Nvidia to maintain its market leadership. The company's dominant position in the data center GPU market, where it captured an astounding 98% market share in 2023, provides a strong foundation for continued growth. The H100 GPU was the hottest AI data center chip globally in 2023, later superseded by the H200 and now by the entirely new generation of GPUs based on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture. CEO Jensen Huang's recent comment about "insane" demand following Blackwell's broad release at the end of 2024 suggests a strong market reception, with sales reportedly meeting high expectations. Major customers' aggressive infrastructure expansion plans further support the outlook for sustained demand growth. Analysts expect NVIDIA to report EPS of $0.79 for the upcoming quarter, reflecting a 61.2% year-over-year increase from last year’s $0.49. The consensus revenue forecast of $38.1 billion exceeds management's guidance of $37.5 billion, signaling market confidence in NVIDIA's ability to outperform expectations. The company has consistently delivered earnings surprises, beating estimates by: Looking ahead to fiscal 2026, analysts project 43.2% year-over-year EPS growth, with earnings expected to reach $3.98 per share, up from $2.77 in fiscal 2025. Longer-term forecasts see EPS climbing to $4.92 in 2027 and $6.26 in 2028, reflecting continued momentum in AI-driven growth. Wall Street focuses on the company's guidance for fiscal 2026's first quarter, with analysts forecasting nearly $42 billion in revenue. If management's guidance tops this number, it could help alleviate concerns about the DeepSeek development's impact on demand. Key factors could significantly influence Nvidia's upcoming earnings report and market reaction. Each element warrants careful consideration as investors position themselves ahead of the announcement. The global semiconductor supply chain remains critical to Nvidia's ability to meet the surging demand for its products. While the company has successfully navigated previous supply constraints, its ability to secure sufficient manufacturing capacity and maintain efficient distribution channels will be crucial for meeting the ambitious growth expectations set by Wall Street. The company's relationships with key manufacturing partners and supply chain management strategies will be particularly important as it ramps production of its new Blackwell-based products while maintaining a supply of existing high-demand components. DeepSeek's recent announcement that it successfully trained competitive AI models for just $5.6 million, using older-generation GPUs, has raised questions about the necessity of cutting-edge hardware for AI development. However, major customer commentary suggests that any training workload reduction could be offset by increasing inference demands, particularly as newer AI models require more computational power for operation. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted that inference workloads are now consuming increasing computing power as newer AI models spend more time "thinking" (test-time scaling). This perspective from one of Nvidia's largest customers helps contextualize the evolving nature of AI infrastructure requirements. While AI and data center applications have dominated recent discussions, Nvidia's gaming business remains significant. The gaming market's health and potential cryptocurrency mining demand could impact overall results. However, these factors have become less important given the overwhelming significance of data center revenue, which accounts for approximately 88% of total revenue. Nvidia's stock presents several compelling opportunities for investors. The company's current valuation metrics, including a P/E ratio of 51.1, represent a 13% discount to its 10-year average P/E ratio 59.2. Based on forward earnings expectations for fiscal 2026 of $4.44 per share, the stock trades at an even more attractive forward P/E of 29.2. This valuation gap suggests significant potential upside, as the stock would need to appreciate by 102% just to trade in line with its historical average P/E ratio, assuming current earnings forecasts prove accurate. Major tech companies' massive capital expenditure commitments suggest sustained strong demand for Nvidia's products through 2025 and beyond. This provides a clear pathway for continued revenue growth and potential market share expansion in the AI infrastructure market. Despite the positive outlook, investors should consider several risk factors. The emergence of efficient training methods demonstrated by DeepSeek could potentially impact demand for high-end GPUs, particularly if similar approaches gain widespread adoption. The stock's high valuation, even at current discounted levels, leaves little room for execution missteps. Any indication of slowing growth or margin pressure could lead to significant price volatility, as evidenced by the 7% decline following the company's Q3 earnings release in November 2024, despite strong results. Competition in the AI chip market is intensifying, with both established players and startups working to develop alternative solutions. While Nvidia's market position remains strong, maintaining its current market share may become increasingly challenging. Bottom Line Nvidia's upcoming earnings report represents a crucial moment for the company and the broader AI industry. While recent developments have introduced some uncertainty, the fundamental drivers of Nvidia's growth remain robust. Strong customer commitments, continuous innovation, and attractive valuation metrics suggest the company is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in AI computing infrastructure. As the February 26 earnings announcement approaches, investors should focus on management's forward guidance and commentary about evolving market dynamics, which will likely provide valuable insights into Nvidia's trajectory for the remainder of 2025 and beyond.

Time Published: 2025-02-15T18:00:00Z

While recent developments have introduced some uncertainty, the fundamental drivers of Nvidia's ... [+] growth remain robust. As the world’s largest semiconductor company prepares to release its fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 (ending January 31, 2025) results post-market close on February 26, 2025, all eyes are on Nvidia Corporation (NVDA). With a staggering market capitalization of $3.4 trillion, the Santa Clara-based tech giant has become synonymous with the AI revolution, transforming from a gaming-focused GPU maker into a full-stack computing powerhouse reshaping global industries. The upcoming earnings report comes at a crucial time for Nvidia, as investors seek clarity on whether the company can maintain its extraordinary growth trajectory amid emerging competition and evolving market dynamics. This analysis explores what investors should know before this pivotal earnings announcement. The artificial intelligence landscape witnessed significant shifts in early 2025, marked by the emergence of new players and technological breakthroughs. One of the most notable developments has been the rise of the Chinese research lab DeepSeek, which demonstrated the ability to train competitive AI models at a fraction of the traditional computing power requirements, challenging conventional assumptions about AI infrastructure needs. Despite these disruptions, major tech companies have doubled their AI investments. Industry giants like Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) have announced record-breaking capital expenditure plans for 2025, with Meta planning to spend up to $65 billion on AI infrastructure (up from $39.2 billion last year), Alphabet projecting $75 billion in capital expenditures. Amazon potentially exceeds $100 billion in AI-related investments Nvidia’s stock has demonstrated remarkable strength, surging 136.7% over the past 52 weeks and significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Index's 25% gain and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's 17.9% return. However, the stock trades approximately 11% below its early January 2025 record high, following concerns about DeepSeek's technological breakthrough. The company's financial performance has been equally impressive, with its most recent quarterly results showcasing the tremendous demand for AI computing solutions. In fiscal Q3 2025, Nvidia reported record Data Center revenue of $30.8 billion, representing a 112% year-over-year increase. Total revenues reached an all-time high of $35.1 billion, up 93.6% from the previous year, while net income grew by 108.9% to $19.3 billion. Current market sentiment remains decisively positive, with 36 out of 43 analysts maintaining "Strong Buy" ratings on the stock. The mean price target of $176.55 suggests a potential 25.4% upside from current levels, reflecting continued optimism about Nvidia’s growth prospects. The primary catalyst driving Nvidia's outlook continues to be the unprecedented demand for AI computing infrastructure. The company's latest Blackwell architecture, particularly the GB200 NVL72 system, offers performance capabilities that are 30 times faster than previous generations for AI inference tasks, positioning Nvidia to maintain its market leadership. The company's dominant position in the data center GPU market, where it captured an astounding 98% market share in 2023, provides a strong foundation for continued growth. The H100 GPU was the hottest AI data center chip globally in 2023, later superseded by the H200 and now by the entirely new generation of GPUs based on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture. CEO Jensen Huang's recent comment about "insane" demand following Blackwell's broad release at the end of 2024 suggests a strong market reception, with sales reportedly meeting high expectations. Major customers' aggressive infrastructure expansion plans further support the outlook for sustained demand growth. Analysts expect NVIDIA to report EPS of $0.79 for the upcoming quarter, reflecting a 61.2% year-over-year increase from last year’s $0.49. The consensus revenue forecast of $38.1 billion exceeds management's guidance of $37.5 billion, signaling market confidence in NVIDIA's ability to outperform expectations. The company has consistently delivered earnings surprises, beating estimates by: Looking ahead to fiscal 2026, analysts project 43.2% year-over-year EPS growth, with earnings expected to reach $3.98 per share, up from $2.77 in fiscal 2025. Longer-term forecasts see EPS climbing to $4.92 in 2027 and $6.26 in 2028, reflecting continued momentum in AI-driven growth. Wall Street focuses on the company's guidance for fiscal 2026's first quarter, with analysts forecasting nearly $42 billion in revenue. If management's guidance tops this number, it could help alleviate concerns about the DeepSeek development's impact on demand. Key factors could significantly influence Nvidia's upcoming earnings report and market reaction. Each element warrants careful consideration as investors position themselves ahead of the announcement. The global semiconductor supply chain remains critical to Nvidia's ability to meet the surging demand for its products. While the company has successfully navigated previous supply constraints, its ability to secure sufficient manufacturing capacity and maintain efficient distribution channels will be crucial for meeting the ambitious growth expectations set by Wall Street. The company's relationships with key manufacturing partners and supply chain management strategies will be particularly important as it ramps production of its new Blackwell-based products while maintaining a supply of existing high-demand components. DeepSeek's recent announcement that it successfully trained competitive AI models for just $5.6 million, using older-generation GPUs, has raised questions about the necessity of cutting-edge hardware for AI development. However, major customer commentary suggests that any training workload reduction could be offset by increasing inference demands, particularly as newer AI models require more computational power for operation. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted that inference workloads are now consuming increasing computing power as newer AI models spend more time "thinking" (test-time scaling). This perspective from one of Nvidia's largest customers helps contextualize the evolving nature of AI infrastructure requirements. While AI and data center applications have dominated recent discussions, Nvidia's gaming business remains significant. The gaming market's health and potential cryptocurrency mining demand could impact overall results. However, these factors have become less important given the overwhelming significance of data center revenue, which accounts for approximately 88% of total revenue. Nvidia's stock presents several compelling opportunities for investors. The company's current valuation metrics, including a P/E ratio of 51.1, represent a 13% discount to its 10-year average P/E ratio 59.2. Based on forward earnings expectations for fiscal 2026 of $4.44 per share, the stock trades at an even more attractive forward P/E of 29.2. This valuation gap suggests significant potential upside, as the stock would need to appreciate by 102% just to trade in line with its historical average P/E ratio, assuming current earnings forecasts prove accurate. Major tech companies' massive capital expenditure commitments suggest sustained strong demand for Nvidia's products through 2025 and beyond. This provides a clear pathway for continued revenue growth and potential market share expansion in the AI infrastructure market. Despite the positive outlook, investors should consider several risk factors. The emergence of efficient training methods demonstrated by DeepSeek could potentially impact demand for high-end GPUs, particularly if similar approaches gain widespread adoption. The stock's high valuation, even at current discounted levels, leaves little room for execution missteps. Any indication of slowing growth or margin pressure could lead to significant price volatility, as evidenced by the 7% decline following the company's Q3 earnings release in November 2024, despite strong results. Competition in the AI chip market is intensifying, with both established players and startups working to develop alternative solutions. While Nvidia's market position remains strong, maintaining its current market share may become increasingly challenging. Bottom Line Nvidia's upcoming earnings report represents a crucial moment for the company and the broader AI industry. While recent developments have introduced some uncertainty, the fundamental drivers of Nvidia's growth remain robust. Strong customer commitments, continuous innovation, and attractive valuation metrics suggest the company is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in AI computing infrastructure. As the February 26 earnings announcement approaches, investors should focus on management's forward guidance and commentary about evolving market dynamics, which will likely provide valuable insights into Nvidia's trajectory for the remainder of 2025 and beyond.

Title: State Of Wisconsin Goes All-In On BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF With $335 Million Investment
URL: https://zycrypto.com/state-of-wisconsin-goes-all-in-on-blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-with-335-million-investment/

The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) has significantly added to its Bitcoin bet by purchasing more shares in a popular crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF). SWIB doubled its holdings in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust to over 6 million. A Feb. 14 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reveals that the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, the entity overseeing the state’s pension fund, now owns over 6 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) fund, worth $335.9 million as of press time. The SWIB in 2024 became the first of its kind to report a Bitcoin ETF purchase, disclosing it had bought shares from both the BlackRock and Grayscale Bitcoin exchange-traded funds collectively worth $164 million at the time. However, Friday’s filing shows that the fund no longer holds any position in Grayscale’s BTC ETF. IBIT has swiftly become one of the fastest-growing spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, accumulating a staggering $40 billion in net inflows since it went live in January 2024. The fund’s assets under management reached $56 billion as of Friday. Although Bitcoin is infamous for its high volatility, institutional investors have a long time horizon for their investments, which allows them to enjoy long-term price gains while disregarding short-term bearish price action. Notably, Bitcoin is emerging as a notable contender to traditional reserve assets like gold and the U.S. dollar, with the potential to transform the global monetary order. Under the new Donald Trump regime, the conversation around Bitcoin has shifted dramatically. Once skeptical, President-elect Donald Trump has expressed support for Bitcoin as a strategic asset, outlining plans for the creation of a U.S. digital asset stockpile to boost economic stability. It’s worth mentioning that other U.S. pension funds are also purchasing crypto exposure. Last year, for example, the State of Michigan Retirement System reported that it had acquired shares in both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. And earlier this week, Goldman Sachs disclosed its holdings of more than $1.5 billion in US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including around $1.2 billion in BlackRock’s IBIT.

Warren Buffett added one new stock to Berkshire Hathaway's publicly-traded equity portfolio, while ... [+] eliminating three holdings. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK/A, BRK/B) fourth-quarter 13F was filed after the market closed on Valentine’s Day, February 14. This regulatory filing gives us a quarterly opportunity to observe what Warren Buffett and his investment team of Todd Combs and Ted Weschler are doing within Berkshire’s publicly traded equity portfolio. Berkshire has a large stable of wholly-owned entities, but this report provides us with the details of the U.S. publicly traded stock portion of their investments. Berkshire’s fourth-quarter earnings report, containing Warren Buffett’s annual letter and information about the extensive portfolio of wholly-owned operating companies, is expected on Saturday, February 22. Berkshire’s $267 billion investment portfolio consists of 38 companies, down two from last quarter. Berkshire was likely a net seller of publicly traded stocks during the quarter. The top five holdings, in order of the size of holding, are Apple (AAPL), American Express (AXP), Bank of America (BAC), Coca-Cola (KO), and Chevron (CVX). The top 5 holdings account for almost 71% of the total portfolio, down from 76% in the first quarter. The investment portfolio remains very concentrated, with nearly 90% of assets in the top ten holdings. Percent Of Berkshire Hathaway's $267 Billion Portfolio: 38 Total Holdings Notably, Berkshire stopped paring their Apple (AAPL) position in the fourth quarter. Before the sales in 2024, Apple stock comprised over 50% of its publicly traded portfolio, but it remains the most significant holding at around 28%. The Berkshire portfolio was overweight technology due to its massive Apple stake, but the selling in 2024 has taken technology to a slight underweight. Despite the trimming of Bank of America (BAC), Capital One Financial (COF), Citigroup (C), and Nu Holdings (NU), the financial sector is the most significant overweight in the portfolio at almost 40% of assets. Due to its top five holdings, plus Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Kraft Heinz (KHC), the portfolio remains considerably overweight in consumer staples and energy relative to the S&P 500. Berkshire controls 28% of the outstanding shares in Occidental, which, combined with Chevron, leads to a significant energy sector overweight. A deeper analysis of the probable reasons behind the Occidental purchase can be found here. Berkshire has only one small holding in the industrial sector and no real estate companies or utilities. However, Berkshire’s wholly-owned entities include a large railroad, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, and multiple regulated utilities and pipelines. Holdings By Sector Because the 13F does not include international stocks, Berkshire Hathaway initially announced the acquisition of about 5% of five Japanese trading companies at the end of August 2020. These holdings are Itochu Corp., Marubeni Corp., Mitsubishi Corp., Mitsui & Co. Ltd., and Sumitomo Corp. Buffett revealed in April 2023 that Berkshire increased its stakes in these companies to 7.4%. Buffett indicated that these were intended to be long-term holdings, and Berkshire may still increase its stake to 9.9%. Berkshire added one new holding, Constellation Brands (STZ). At a value of over $1.2 billion and the nineteenth largest holding, it was a decent-sized addition to the portfolio, accounting for almost half a percent of assets. Constellation is best known for owning the rights to Corona and Modelo beers in the U.S., but it also owns some wine and spirits brands. Beer accounts for about 80% of their sales. In January, the company reported worse-than-expected quarterly earnings and lowered its outlook for the year. Potential tariffs on Mexico could negatively impact its Mexican beer earnings. In addition, there are fears that the GLP-1 diet drugs and a growing preference for cannabis could weigh on the long-term outlook of its alcohol brands. On the other hand, the stock is now selling for a multi-year low in valuation across several metrics. Berkshire added to its positions in Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Pool Corporation (POOL), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Verisign (VRSN), and Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI). Ulta Beauty (ULTA) was eliminated from the portfolio in the quarter after being trimmed last quarter. Notably, Ulta Beauty was newly added to the portfolio in the second quarter of 2024. Minor holdings in the Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO) and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were also jettisoned. Within financials, Berkshire trimmed its Citigroup (C), Capital One Financial (COF), Bank of America (BAC), and NU Holdings (NU). Warren Buffett is regarded as one of the greatest bank stock investors ever. Hence, the continued reduction in exposure to the banking sector is notable, but almost 40% of the stock portfolio remains in financial companies. Berkshire also reduced its positions in T-Mobile (TMUS), Charter Communications (CHTR), Liberty Media—Formula One (FWONK), and Louisiana-Pacific (LPX). This analysis looks at the Berkshire portfolio across a host of measures, including 12-month forward estimated: price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), return-on-equity (ROE), enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EV/EBITDA), price-to-book (P/B), dividend yield, current debt-to-EBITDA, current free cash flow yield, current operating margin, and long-term earnings-per-share growth consensus estimates. Portfolio Valuation Metrics Overall, the Berkshire portfolio analysis reflects a cheaper price-to-earnings valuation than the S&P 500 while having superior profitability as measured by return on equity and operating margin with similar debt levels. The long-term (next 3 to 5 years) consensus earnings-per-share growth rate is expected to be lower than the S&P 500. Buffett’s preference for high-quality companies that generate significant cash flows is evident from the better profitability metrics combined with a superior free cash flow yield. Berkshire was likely a net seller of stocks in its portfolio for the ninth quarter in a row, with an estimated net sales of about $5 billion in publicly traded stocks. The exact value of stock moves will be disclosed with Saturday’s earnings release. Between the continued stock sales and Berkshire’s massive stockpile of cash, Buffett seems unable to find enough attractive acquisition targets in his circle of competence and at a valuation he is willing to pay. Disclosure: Glenview Trust holds Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) and other stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies. I am a long-time Berkshire Hathaway shareholder and worked for Salomon Brothers when Warren Buffett became Chairman and CEO.

This analysis looks at the Berkshire portfolio across a host of measures, including 12-month forward estimated: price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), return-on-equity (ROE), enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EV/EBITDA), price-to-book (P/B), dividend yield, current debt-to-EBITDA, current free cash flow yield, current operating margin, and long-term earnings-per-share growth consensus estimates. Portfolio Valuation Metrics Overall, the Berkshire portfolio analysis reflects a cheaper price-to-earnings valuation than the S&P 500 while having superior profitability as measured by return on equity and operating margin with similar debt levels. The long-term (next 3 to 5 years) consensus earnings-per-share growth rate is expected to be lower than the S&P 500. Buffett’s preference for high-quality companies that generate significant cash flows is evident from the better profitability metrics combined with a superior free cash flow yield. Berkshire was likely a net seller of stocks in its portfolio for the ninth quarter in a row, with an estimated net sales of about $5 billion in publicly traded stocks. The exact value of stock moves will be disclosed with Saturday’s earnings release. Between the continued stock sales and Berkshire’s massive stockpile of cash, Buffett seems unable to find enough attractive acquisition targets in his circle of competence and at a valuation he is willing to pay.

Warren Buffett added one new stock to Berkshire Hathaway's publicly-traded equity portfolio, while ... [+] eliminating three holdings. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK/A, BRK/B) fourth-quarter 13F was filed after the market closed on Valentine’s Day, February 14. This regulatory filing gives us a quarterly opportunity to observe what Warren Buffett and his investment team of Todd Combs and Ted Weschler are doing within Berkshire’s publicly traded equity portfolio. Berkshire has a large stable of wholly-owned entities, but this report provides us with the details of the U.S. publicly traded stock portion of their investments. Berkshire’s fourth-quarter earnings report, containing Warren Buffett’s annual letter and information about the extensive portfolio of wholly-owned operating companies, is expected on Saturday, February 22. Berkshire’s $267 billion investment portfolio consists of 38 companies, down two from last quarter. Berkshire was likely a net seller of publicly traded stocks during the quarter. The top five holdings, in order of the size of holding, are Apple (AAPL), American Express (AXP), Bank of America (BAC), Coca-Cola (KO), and Chevron (CVX). The top 5 holdings account for almost 71% of the total portfolio, down from 76% in the first quarter. The investment portfolio remains very concentrated, with nearly 90% of assets in the top ten holdings. Percent Of Berkshire Hathaway's $267 Billion Portfolio: 38 Total Holdings Notably, Berkshire stopped paring their Apple (AAPL) position in the fourth quarter. Before the sales in 2024, Apple stock comprised over 50% of its publicly traded portfolio, but it remains the most significant holding at around 28%. The Berkshire portfolio was overweight technology due to its massive Apple stake, but the selling in 2024 has taken technology to a slight underweight. Despite the trimming of Bank of America (BAC), Capital One Financial (COF), Citigroup (C), and Nu Holdings (NU), the financial sector is the most significant overweight in the portfolio at almost 40% of assets. Due to its top five holdings, plus Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Kraft Heinz (KHC), the portfolio remains considerably overweight in consumer staples and energy relative to the S&P 500. Berkshire controls 28% of the outstanding shares in Occidental, which, combined with Chevron, leads to a significant energy sector overweight. A deeper analysis of the probable reasons behind the Occidental purchase can be found here. Berkshire has only one small holding in the industrial sector and no real estate companies or utilities. However, Berkshire’s wholly-owned entities include a large railroad, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, and multiple regulated utilities and pipelines. Holdings By Sector Because the 13F does not include international stocks, Berkshire Hathaway initially announced the acquisition of about 5% of five Japanese trading companies at the end of August 2020. These holdings are Itochu Corp., Marubeni Corp., Mitsubishi Corp., Mitsui & Co. Ltd., and Sumitomo Corp. Buffett revealed in April 2023 that Berkshire increased its stakes in these companies to 7.4%. Buffett indicated that these were intended to be long-term holdings, and Berkshire may still increase its stake to 9.9%. Berkshire added one new holding, Constellation Brands (STZ). At a value of over $1.2 billion and the nineteenth largest holding, it was a decent-sized addition to the portfolio, accounting for almost half a percent of assets. Constellation is best known for owning the rights to Corona and Modelo beers in the U.S., but it also owns some wine and spirits brands. Beer accounts for about 80% of their sales. In January, the company reported worse-than-expected quarterly earnings and lowered its outlook for the year. Potential tariffs on Mexico could negatively impact its Mexican beer earnings. In addition, there are fears that the GLP-1 diet drugs and a growing preference for cannabis could weigh on the long-term outlook of its alcohol brands. On the other hand, the stock is now selling for a multi-year low in valuation across several metrics. Berkshire added to its positions in Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Pool Corporation (POOL), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Verisign (VRSN), and Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI). Ulta Beauty (ULTA) was eliminated from the portfolio in the quarter after being trimmed last quarter. Notably, Ulta Beauty was newly added to the portfolio in the second quarter of 2024. Minor holdings in the Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO) and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were also jettisoned. Within financials, Berkshire trimmed its Citigroup (C), Capital One Financial (COF), Bank of America (BAC), and NU Holdings (NU). Warren Buffett is regarded as one of the greatest bank stock investors ever. Hence, the continued reduction in exposure to the banking sector is notable, but almost 40% of the stock portfolio remains in financial companies. Berkshire also reduced its positions in T-Mobile (TMUS), Charter Communications (CHTR), Liberty Media—Formula One (FWONK), and Louisiana-Pacific (LPX). This analysis looks at the Berkshire portfolio across a host of measures, including 12-month forward estimated: price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), return-on-equity (ROE), enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EV/EBITDA), price-to-book (P/B), dividend yield, current debt-to-EBITDA, current free cash flow yield, current operating margin, and long-term earnings-per-share growth consensus estimates. Portfolio Valuation Metrics Overall, the Berkshire portfolio analysis reflects a cheaper price-to-earnings valuation than the S&P 500 while having superior profitability as measured by return on equity and operating margin with similar debt levels.

Title: It's common to compare AI developments to the Space Race, but it's far from the same

Time Published: 2025-02-15T16:00:01Z
Full Content:
On July 20, 1969, as Neil Armstrong planted his foot on the Moon, he spoke the famous words “That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” His universal words were an interesting choice given he was on the Moon to establish the dominance of the United States in space and regain the lead in the Space Race after the Soviet Union had a series of early successes such as launching the first satellite - Sputnik, put the first man and woman in space, performed the first space walk, and launched the first probe that impacted the Moon. Today, progress in space is still being made but NASA and SpaceX have a clear lead in the field, and there's not as much national urgency as we saw during the Space Race. The focus has now shifted towards what has been dubbed the AI Race by the media. The main players in this race are the United States and China. It had been assumed that the US had a several year lead on China in AI, by figures like former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Less than a year after that prediction, Chinese firm DeepSeek released its R1 reasoning model that was comparable to o1 from OpenAI. While OpenAI had been hiding o1 behind a paywall, DeepSeek released its reasoning model for free in its app, open sourced most of the code, and made it competitive with o1, but it cost a fraction of the price to train. DeepSeek gripped headlines for days, and it was even mentioned by President Trump. It had the United States spooked. If the AI Race wasn't on before, it certainly is now. In this editorial, I want to criticize the term AI Race. The main basis for my criticism of the term is the fact that many of the AI models that are being released, are being made open source. DeepSeek is the most famous example of an open-source model, and that's from the supposed competitor, China. American companies have already taken the code, removed the censorship Chinese law requires for its companies, and have even monetized it. While the chief American AI firm, OpenAI, is keeping its AI development a secret, Meta has made its Llama AI models open source and communities like Hugging Face are doing their best to make open source models more available and is even developing software to plug gaps, including with its Open Deep Research project. While I think it's true it could be construed as an AI Race with regards to weapons of war, I'm a lot more skeptical about the description being applied in the context of large language models, especially when it involves the significant sharing of the source code of models. In this editorial, I will look in-depth at the competition between the US and the USSR during the Space Race and the competition between the US and China in the AI Race. I will look at how they are different and outline a more constructive framework for understanding what's happening now. The Space Race got underway on July 30, 1955, when the United States declared its intent to put satellites into Earth orbit. This was reciprocated by the Russians four days later who said they would also do the same in the near future. The Space Race came as a direct result of the Cold War where the capitalist West was facing off with the communist East, which had gained ground around the world after overthrowing the Nazis and their allies in Eastern Europe during World War II and as a result of decolonization in the Global South. Building sophisticated rockets and satellites was important for both sides. The rockets could be adapted for nuclear warheads in the case of a hot war and the satellites were useful for intelligence gathering - satellites are still widely used for this today. Feats like getting to the Moon, while less directly useful in the case of war, acted like propaganda for the respective nation's economic system. For the Space Race to finally end, it took the complete collapse of the Soviet Union, after which, Russia collaborated with the US and its allies on space with projects like the International Space Station. Unlike today's AI Race where many players are releasing their source code publicly, the space programs run by the US and the USSR were both secretive and nationalized. Many details about AI advancements can be found in scientific papers too, whereas in the Space Race, there was tighter control over what information was being shared to help each of the countries keep their respective advantages. As a result of the Space Race, both countries developed their own rocket technologies, with the German V-2 rocket as the shared basis. They both developed their own satellites such as Sputnik 1 and Explorer 1, they both developed their own human spaceflight system independently, as well as their space suits and life support systems. This is very different to the AI Race where advancements in the AI space are being shared. We are even being given roundabout information from companies like OpenAI who choose not to open up their source code. The main consequences of developing technologies in silos were slowed scientific advancements, duplicated efforts, and increased geopolitical tensions. The main goals of the Space Race, aside from the military applications of the satellites and rockets, was the ability to show off which country had the best political and economic system. It also acted to give the countries more prestige when they were able to achieve milestones with the technology they had achieved. With the so-called AI Race, America is keen on maintaining its leadership for further economic benefits, and to promote its values of freedom and human rights. One significant issue we saw with DeepSeek was the embedded censorship which stopped the model from criticizing the ruling Communist Party, its leader, or its geopolitical ambitions. Finally, it’s worth pointing out that the two races are different in that the Space Race was primarily driven by the US and Russian governments, rather than private business, with largely military ends. On the other hand, the cutting edge AI tools are being developed by private companies with a focus on productivity and efficiency. It’s true that there are military applications for artificial intelligence, which are dangerous, but primarily, the concern seems to be economic. If the current situation around artificial intelligence was truly a race, we would expect businesses developing this software to hold all their secrets close to their chest, making it harder to catch up, but that is not what we are seeing. While some businesses can be categorized like this with their closed source models, organizations working on open models such as Meta, Mistral AI, DeepSeek, Alibaba, Stability AI, and Hugging Face. Even companies like Google, which have developed closed source models, have released development tools like TensorFlow to advance AI development. This level of openness seems to be a more collaborative phenomenon, rather than a competitive race. Not only are companies releasing their software as open source programs, but their research is also being published in open pre-print publications such as arXiv allowing for the greater levels of collaboration. This further detracts from the idea of an AI Race. The open publication of AI research papers means that companies from different countries are integrating the latest ideas to improve their models. Even in the case of OpenAI, which is closed source, the recent release of DeepSeek R1 impressed Sam Altman who put a special emphasis on noting what R1 delivers for the price. Now that OpenAI knows more efficient methods exist, and has R1’s code, it can make its own models more efficient and available at a lower cost to consumers. The efficient techniques used by R1 also highlights another key difference between AI competition and the Space Race - that is, it’s mainly driven by economic and commercial factors, rather than for military ends or proving if particular countries have a better economic model. Just days after the release of DeepSeek R1 and its unlimited thinking requests, suddenly OpenAI releases o3-mini for free users (it still has a limit), and in recent days, Google released its thinking version of Gemini Flash 2.0 for free users. This type of behavior is common in the AI race; charge an incredible amount of money from premium users until one player makes a new feature, such as reasoning, available for all and then the other players are forced to follow suit. While it’s true that AI does have military applications, these consumer facing generative AI bots are focused on economics - such as making money for the business that makes them and adding productivity for those who consume them. Ultimately, the AI Race narrative is an oversimplification and rather too dramatic. For the most part the development of AI and products that come as a result, are just an example of normal economic competition. In fact, the field has much more collaboration going on compared to other industries. I heard about DeepSeek a couple of days before awareness of it exploded across international news channels. Sure, it wouldn’t talk about the Communist Party of China, its leader, or the country’s territorial disputes, but it would do pretty much everything else. Not only did it scour up to a huge 50 online news sources, but it also used reasoning, in an unlimited quantity, to give me better responses. I could ask it all sorts of things such as for comprehensive stock exit strategies, I could ask it who it thought would win particular horse races, and I could get it to answer all sorts of speculative questions such as what month and year does it think humans will get to Mars. Compared to the offerings at the time from Google and OpenAI, DeepSeek stood head and shoulders above. For free users, DeepSeek was the only company offering unlimited access to the web and reasoning combined. As a result, it climbed to the top of app stores and spooked the US tech industry and investors who thought it spelt the end of the AI bubble. Unlike those inferior models from Google and OpenAI (the ones available to free users), DeepSeek R1 was an open source model. This means that the company divulges most of the inner workings of the model so that others can take and adapt it, as long as they follow any provisions set out in the open source license. While largely open source, some components remained closed including the methodologies for data collection, model training, and scaling laws. Once DeepSeek had become widely known, and name dropped by President Trump, the company started being impacted by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack - the Venom DDoS Community has claimed responsibility for this attack. While DeepSeek was being attacked, Meta started dissecting the code to improve its own Llama models and Perplexity hosted an uncensored version in the US for use on its platform, though it's not unlimited like the one hosted by DeepSeek. The open source AI community, Hugging Face, has also hosted the DeepSeek R1 model on its HuggingChat platform, but this model doesn’t have as comprehensive web access like that found in the DeepSeek app. The best example of DeepSeek’s technology being monetized by American companies is in the case of Perplexity which offers a handful of R1 searches to free users before asking them to upgrade to a premium tier. By monetizing reasoning models, companies like Perplexity can limit access to its compute power so that the service remains fast for all users. This added sustainability also ensures it can continue to grow in the future. Making money and ensuring access to a stable platform is in no way at odds with the open source model, open source just means that people can share their research and tools are potentially developed quicker. Aside from the business benefits and research benefits, open sourcing models can also democratize access to AI technology. AI engineering can be a very lucrative career for anyone willing to put in the time and effort required and by opening up model source code, those who are interested, and learn more about how models are made, potentially opening up careers. It also allows tinkerers to run models on their own hardware for unlimited access and more privacy. If the AI Race was truly a race comparable to the Space Race, China wouldn’t be allowing its models to be open sourced so that American businesses can profit on them and boost America’s economy. For the most part, it is just like any other competition we see countries engaging in. I think it’s also generally a good thing that countries and businesses are being this open as it means we could reach artificial general intelligence and artificial superintelligence much faster. Just look at how the AI we currently have is contributing to fields like healthcare and material science - imagine what will be unlocked when we have AI that surpasses what humans are capable of. We will have lots of new breakthroughs in many fields which will lift up everyone’s living conditions. These more powerful AI systems will also require more power, this will likely see investments in renewable energy and nuclear energy, helping the shift away from fossil fuels. Since the early days of the generative AI era, which kicked off in November 2022 with the arrival of ChatGPT, AI companies have sought to claw back their losses from customers by offering better language models or restricting the number of requests free users can make. To attract customers, companies need to offer the best language models and avoid being overtaken by their competitors. Up to the present, OpenAI has largely been seen as the leader in the space. It has recently released the Operator web browser, which is AI operated and Deep Research. Both products are groundbreaking in terms of functionality. Other companies like Google and Meta are also trying to branch out from chatbots too, Google has developed NotebookLM which lets you upload sources such as reports and then get help from AI to sift through the massive loads of data. Meta has also started expanding its AI tools with the launch of AI-supported document editor. An important consideration for AI is the hardware that it runs on. Nvidia has been a major beneficiary in this respect because its hardware has been what’s powering models like ChatGPT. Sam Altman, head of OpenAI also expressed last year that $7 trillion was needed to overcome hardware limitations affecting AI progress. When DeepSeek R1 came along, claiming to be 27 times cheaper to run than OpenAI’s o1 reasoning model, it sent stocks in the US tumbling because there was a realization that maybe so much compute power wasn’t needed after all and also, just how the hell were AI companies planning to make money if DeepSeek was giving unlimited access to its AI and open sourcing all its code? The release of DeepSeek put pressure on OpenAI to release its new o3-mini reasoning for all users, including those who don’t pay. While Sam Altman publicly says he is excited about the competition, there are also claims that its lead is also narrowing, which could be worrying the company internally. DeepSeek R1’s launch has not been all bad news for the American players though. The popular AI search engine Perplexity was quick to add R1 to its collection of reasoning models as part of its Pro search. Free users get a handful of Pro searches per day, but to unlock more, you have to pay. The inclusion of R1 could have made the subscription more appealing, leading to increased revenues for the company. Perplexity was able to uncensor the model and host it in the US, removing any political bias concerns that exist with the DeepSeek-hosted model. At the time of writing, it’s fair to say that despite the benefits of open source models, they have not managed to surpass the proprietary leaders yet, although, they’re not too far behind. In terms of hosted services, these open source models contribute to a more competitive playing field. They also provide unique benefits such as being able to run them on local hardware, which is good for privacy and having unlimited access in terms of requests. In this editorial, I have tried to dispel the notion that what’s happening in AI today is not an AI Race comparable to the Space Race, but rather, ordinary competition, with a whole lot of collaboration. The frequent publications of AI research papers and the release of open source models like DeepSeek’s R1 stand in contrast to the largely secretive development of rockets and satellites in the Space Race, which the media tries to draw comparisons with. The development of new AI tools is moving quite rapidly with cutting edge features usually hidden behind a paywall until one of the market participants decides to release those features and the other players follow suit. Thanks to the greater sharing of information compared to developments during the Space Race, there is less reproduced effort going on and things are moving along quickly. As mentioned earlier, another difference between the Space Race and the AI competition is that the former was between governments, and the latter by private companies, seeking market share and profits. Going forward, it is unclear what will happen between the closed source AI companies like OpenAI and the open source models. Monetization of AI is an important factor as it can help companies recruit and retain the best talent in the industry, which free open models may struggle to do. According to the OpenAI Careers page, a Software Engineer (Full Stack) can earn between $160,000 and $385,000, plus offers equity. Obviously, companies like Meta and DeepSeek are able to pay these great wages despite having open models, but it does make the task easier when models are being monetized. If a company like DeepSeek with open source models does end up taking over OpenAI, it will likely happen all of a sudden with a new model landing and OpenAI not being able to respond quickly, only time will tell what happens going forward though.

The cryptocurrency exchange and wallet provider Blockchain.com has taken new steps toward a potential initial public offering (IPO) by appointing two seasoned executives with financial and operational expertise. Blockchain.com hired Justin Evans, who previously worked at Goldman Sachs, as its new chief financial officer, Bloomberg reported. It also appointed Mike Wilcox, previously CFO of Velocity Global and former Point72 portfolio manager, as its chief operating officer. Evans said that the exchange is “taking the steps necessary to be a public company, if and when the public markets are available.” The move comes amid a flurry of other cryptocurrency firms reported to be considering going public, including Circle, Kraken, Bullish Global (Parent company of CoinDesk), Gemini, Ripple and BitGo. Growing institutional adoption after major firms, including BlackRock and Fidelity, launched exchange-traded fund (ETF) offerings in the cryptocurrency space and the more balanced approach the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to take toward digital assets are creating a potentially more favorable environment for these firms to go public. Blockchain.com has seen its valuation fluctuate over time. In March 2021, it raised $300 million at a $5.2 billion post-money valuation in its Series C funding round. In 2022, it closed a funding round that increased its valuation to $14 billion, while in Nov. 2023, it closed a $110 million funding round valuing the company at $7 billion.

Related Stories ‘The White Lotus’ Returns with Top-Tier Performances: Episode 1 Review ‘The Chosen’ Finds Its New Streaming Kingdom on Amazon Prime Video Frazza worked on hundreds of shows during her career at CBS, including “Wheel of Fortune,” “Jeopardy,” “The Price is Right,” “Dancing with the Stars,” “Survivor,” “The Young and the Restless,” and “The Bold and the Beautiful.” Before I retired [after 30 years as a scenic artist at CBS Studios], I painted and executed designs that the production designer actually designed. I followed the production designer’s wishes, and I custom-mixed colors that were needed, and I painted murals and 3-D pieces such as furniture and tables, desks. I excelled in marbleizing and faux wood grain. And I led crews who did the same thing, which was very rewarding for me. Game Shows [Years ago] on “Wheel of Fortune,” we used to do the murals, but now they do everything digitally. Things like, “You can win this trip to Hawaii.” And same thing with “The Price Is Right,” we’d do these mini murals 10 by 8 feet or whatever, and we’d paint the murals they’d show on camera. “Jeopardy,” we would do their floors. I think at the end they did special tiles. Set pieces would come into the shop in pieces, and we’d have to touch them up because they’d get beat up in transit. So we had a stock of colors for each show, well marked, very well organized. So if you need “Price Is Right” green for the door, you’d go to the “Price Is Right” shelves and find the green for the door. And if you dont have enough. “The Young and the Restless” and “The Bold and the Beautiful” When I started, we would do three rehearsals per scene. Then it went down to two rehearsals, then one rehearsal, and then they’d just wing it. If I wanted to go in and touch something up towards the end of my run, the producer would come over the loudspeaker and say, “It’s fine, Lisa”. But I had to run in during those rehearsals and touch up whatever I could that I saw on the monitor. So toward the end of my run, everything had to [start off] perfect. In a corner of the stage [were] cans of paint and brushes. And if I knew a certain scene was coming up, I’d get a 1-gallon bucket and put in paper cups of each color I might need, grab a few little brushes and a wet rag, and I’d be ready to jump in if need be. There’s no time to go over to that corner of the stage. You have to be uber-prepared. Jack Forestall, the production designer for “Bold and the Beautiful,” is going to present me with the award, and what’s so cool about that is he actually worked for me in 1983 back in Philadelphia. I worked for a shop that did the Philadelphia opera company sets, and Jack came to work there while he was going for his master’s at Temple University. Then he and his wife came out here, and the rest is history. Mesney’s extensive resume boasts 60 feature films, including “Argo,” “Hail, Caesar!,” “Gone Girl,” “Crazy, Stupid, Love,” and “Little Fockers,” while her TV credits range from “Bosch” to the Brandy “Cinderella” and “Grace & Frankie.” Most of the time, people say, “Oh, really? You did something? What did you do?” People don’t understand that, unlike in theater, where you’re aware that there’s a set and it’s like a sculpture sitting up there on stage, in film and television, the objective is to not be noticed. To not have your work be seen. We’re always doing something; it could be the smallest thing or a monumental thing. It could be, you know, an entire set, or, you know, like I remember in the old days when I started before we had all these graphic software programs. The set designers used to do the signs, too. We did all the sign work. So it’s very different now, with all that shifted away from us. But we would design the sets, and then we would design the signs. So sometimes it would just be putting up a little piece of wall or a sign or, you know, usually a director and a DP and, and the production designer go into a location and there are some modifications that have to happen for the action to occur there. And like I say, it could be anything like that up to a standing set or, you know, what Jack Fisk does out, and you know, like on the revenant or something where they’re creating whole worlds outside. It could be anything and then you know, so that’s why I tell people I’m I’m designing all this stuff So I call myself like an architect. Like a backstage architect, I’m doing the building drawings and I’m doing the models But it’s all stuff that people basically will never be aware of. “Basic Instinct” That was part of my San Francisco days. You know, I started in theater. And so I had been designing live theater for years. And I had done one other movie project prior to “Basic Instinct.” And then I had gone abroad. When I came back, I got this offer to do “Basic Instinct.” I literally [landed], and within nine hours, I was working on “Basic Instinct.” I know. It was great. That was Terry Marsh, he was the production designer. This is a good story. “Basic Instinct,” the main character is bisexual, right? That’s the whole context. And so we wanted to rent this gay bar in San Francisco. It was a beautiful location because they had all the flags and it was already set up for this shot. And the owner of that bar was willing to rent it to the company, but only if he could see the script. So they gave him the script, and the end result of that was that [he] took offense to the fact that she was a killer. It put the gay community on high alert and they basically showed up at every location we went to shoot at. We were boycotted, and they always made a lot of noise, whistles and everything. But beyond that, some of the sets were sabotaged, people were taking paint balloons and throwing them at the sets the night before we’d be shooting. My first movie, “Class Action,” also in San Francisco, was the total opposite. It went like clockwork, without a hitch, nothing went wrong. And [the crew] were all up from Hollywood, and they were saying to me, “Barbara, it’s not normally like this. Don’t think that the movie business is like this, because usually there’s some drama going on somewhere.” Sure enough, “Basic Instinct,” man. Literally every day was a crisis in the art department because something had to be fixed. Everybody, not just the art department. But we got through it, and it was a very fun project to have worked on and I met some great people. That was one of the ones where I had to knock out the sets and then get onto the signage so that the scenic artists could paint these signs, because that was the way it was done in those days. I remember doing that Chinatown set, having to draw a sign with Chinese characters. We would do them in full scale so that they could be built. And trying to get this Chinese sign created by an actual Chinese sign maker in neon so that it’s accurate. It was constantly checking and making sure that you’re being accurate because everyone’s going to see this thing on a big screen. “Twin Peaks” I got to do all the dream sequences. That was really fun, and I just remember [David Lynch and I would] go back and forth and back and forth, and he was a real detail guy. He had a very specific vision. I remember the art director came in and the production designer, Ruth, said to me, “You and he are on the same wavelength, so this is great.” They gave me all of the wacky stuff to design, basically all the stage sets for all these dream sequences, the one where he comes through the window and has to go through this old, beautiful villa where that weird thing is on the wall and the radio station and the desert. Sweetman has worked extensively on storyboards for over 100 films, including two Best Picture winners, “Braveheart” and “Birdman,” as well as “Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,” “The Prestige,” and “The Nutty Professor.” Storyboards are a visual script, a tool to help the director, to guide the way through the story in general. We’re sort of guardians of the story. But what I do, you never see it on the screen. You see the thoughts and the ideas. There are so many pushes and pulls on the story that it could lose its way if one influence is too great. So, I always thought the storyboard artist helps the director visualize the thing, but he’d also keep an eye on if the story is still being true to what it was designed to be. By the time shooting starts, I’m done. When they get on the set the first day, they’re not wondering, “How are we going to shoot this?” It’s all there. So that’s the most valuable use of the skill “Braveheart” Braveheart was great. It was my first road show on location. So we went to England, Scotland, and Ireland. And I was still sort of new in the business. So this was like a big, big deal, big Hollywood experience. And so I was just trying to learn as much as I could. It was unusual for me because, like I said, usually, I’m off the picture when it starts shooting. Right. But there was enough work that I was just ahead of the shooting schedule. I was drawing stuff like three weeks ahead of filming. And I remember David Tomlin, the legendary English first AD guy, he’s going page by page. And they got through what I call the gags. The fighting maneuvers and stuff, which I kind of stayed away from because the stunt coordinator is going to come up with it. But I did do the one of the dagger in the eye. And Tomlin goes, “All right, who thought of this?” And it wasn’t as much who thought of it as how are we going to do this? It was a lot of fun memories. “Birdman” I did sort of thumbnail because Alejandro Iñárritu could visualize it, but he needed help. He goes, “Oh, the whole movie’s one shot.” I go, “What?” “Yeah, we’re going to do a one-shot movie. That’s why you’re here, because we need to find transition points.” And we need to map out what to decide howto sell it as a continued shot. He was very much with the DP kind of mapping it all out. Basically, I was just taking notes and then presenting him the work. So I wasn’t as much of an idea participant as a helpful wrist. Now retired, Washington spent 56 years in the film industry, beginning as an assistant art director on “The Exorcist II” and even serving as the second unit director on three projects. Some of his favorite projects include “Stand by Me,” “The Fugitive,” and “13 Days.” Years ago, somebody said that what I do is everything that’s out of focus. It’s a little better than that, I think! It’s creating the visual environment in the scenes. And the collaboration is important with the DP and with the production designer. “Prizzi’s Honor” I started [with John Huston] on “Victory” back in 1980 in Budapest. With Sylvester Stallone and Michael Caine in a prisoner-of-war camp. That was my first introduction to John. Totally intimidated. But I learned a lot from John. How do I make something true to the reality of the film, but at the same time make it interesting without without showing off? With John, he would he would let you find the best. There was a day on “Prizzi’s Honor” where we were doing a bookie operation for the Mafia. And I had some pictures of old research of these places and this and that. And he says, “Have you ever been to one of these?” I did a lot of research, but I didn’t actually go to one. And he brought Jack Nicholson over. And he says, “Jack, why don’t you get Rocky?” One of our mafia consultants. “Why don’t you have Rocky take Dennis over to one of these bookie gambling places and just see what it is.” And we went to some little street where there were just little nothing houses, shacks. And we went into this one and it was the same inside that it was outside: nothing. And there was a bunch of guys around, and we said, “I’d like to see the operation if that’s all right.” So I went in the back room and this whole operation in this little shack was one phone on a little table, not even a desk. That’s the whole operation. In my research, I wasn’t trying to go over the top, but I was trying to make something that had a little more weight to it. So I went back to John, and I explained what I saw over there, and he said, “Do what you were gonna do.” He just wanted to know the truth. He wants to go back to the roots of reality so that if we’re bending the rules, we know where we’re coming from and we’re not just making shit up. “The Net” Irwin Winkler was directing that, and he’s a big Hitchcock fan. There was one thing that I saw in Washington, D.C., a sculpture called The Awakening. It’s like an 80-foot-high reclining man, but he’s pulling himself out of the earth, so you see portions of him, his knees, his hands. So we had a scene at the beginning of the picture where this upstanding businessman goes to a park to have lunch, and you can tell he’s quiet, very methodical. And then he leans back and blows his brains out. I brought Erwin out there, and I said, “What if we bring him to the park bench here, and when he brings the gun up, we just crane up and reveal the statue behind him in the ground coming out?” I caught him contemplating it, and I said, “Hitchcock would have done it.” So that kind of cinched it, and it worked great. It was a nice opening to the film. By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

Title: Trader Says Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokens Looking Better Than Most of the Crypto Market – Here Are His Top Picks

A crypto strategist known for accurately calling the 2021 digital asset cycle top says the real-world asset (RWA) sector is showing a lot of market strength. The analyst pseudonymously known as Pentoshi tells his 854,800 followers on the social media platform X that Chintai (CHEX), Ondo Finance (ONDO) and Clearpool (CPOOL) are three RWA altcoins poised for rallies. RWA crypto projects aim to tokenize traditional assets so that they can be traded on blockchains, enabling efficiency and accessibility, fractional ownership and other benefits. Says Pentoshi, “CHEX, ONDO, CPOOL: RWA play updates. CHEX actually made new highs after the big sell-off two weeks ago, and RWAs had the strongest recoveries of any sector. All structurally look better than most of the market currently with retests of nice high time frame levels.” CHEX is trading for $0.44 at time of writing, flat on the day. ONDO is trading for $1.32 at time of writing, down marginally in the last 24 hours. CPOOL is trading for $0.26 at time of writing, up 10% on the day. The analyst also says that he is bullish on the Ethereum (ETH)-based automated staking service Lido DAO (LDO), and he believes the token may get a boost from potential approvals of ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with staking. “LDO update: big move off the lows, probably a little local resistance here so potentially some consolidation but a great move so far… Next guess is that more staked ETF filings will come through. Then these ETFs will have to decide on infrastructure. So people will have to think about who the infrastructure will be. And companies like BlackRock will choose LDO (will be another too) and some of these will probably have to reprice a bit in theory of course because with markets you never know.” LDO is trading for $1.85 at time of writing, up 10% in the last 24 hours.

A regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows that the SWIB now owns over 6 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) fund, worth $335.9 million as of this writing. Last year, the SWIB disclosed it had bought shares from both the BlackRock and Grayscale Bitcoin ETFs collectively worth $163 million at the time, but Friday’s filing shows that its crypto exposure now is exclusively with IBIT. The SWIB is responsible for the citizens’ pension funds and other trusts in the Midwestern state. It makes all kinds of investments, from tech stocks to gold. The SEC last year approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, allowing the products to trade on American stock exchanges after a decade of denials. Investors can now buy shares that track the price of Bitcoin and not have to worry about storing the asset themselves. Since their approval, investor capital has flooded the space and Bitcoin has broken new all-time price highs, most recently marking a peak just shy of $109,000 in January. Institutional investors are now able to access the crypto space via the regulated funds. Other American pension funds are also buying exposure to crypto. Last year, for example, the State of Michigan Retirement System disclosed that it had bought shares in both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.

Title: Dating App Cover-Up: How Tinder, Hinge, and Their Corporate Owner Keep Rape Under Wraps

The Dating Apps Reporting Project is an 18-month investigation. It was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Centerâs AI Accountability Network and The Markup, now a part of CalMatters, and copublished with The Guardian and The 19th.Â When a young woman in Denver met up with a smiling cardiologist she matched with on the dating app Hinge, she had no way of knowing that the company behind the app had already received reports from two other women who accused him of rape. She met the 34-year-old doctor with green eyes and thinning hair at Highland Tap & Burger, a sports bar in a trendy neighborhood. It went well enough that she accepted an invitation to go back to his apartment. As she emerged from his bathroom, he handed her a tequila soda. What transpired over the next 24 hours, according to court testimony, reads like every personâs dating app nightmare. After sipping the drink, the woman started to lose control. Her memory blurred. She fell to the ground, and the man started to film her. He put her in a headlock, kissing her forehead; she struggled to free herself but managed to grab her things and leave. He followed her out the door, holding her shoes and trying to force her back inside, but she was able to call an Uber, vomiting in the car on the way home. She woke up at home, soaking wet on her bathroom floor, the key to her house still in her door. She continued vomiting for hours. When she came to, she reported the assault to Hinge. Hinge is one of more than a dozen dating apps owned by Match Group. The $8.5 billion global conglomerate also owns brands like Tinder (the worldâs most popular dating app), OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish. Match Group controls half of the worldâs online dating market, operates in 190 countries, and facilitates meetups for millions of people. Match Groupâs official safety policy states that when a user is reported for assault, âall accounts found that are associated with that user will be banned from our platforms.â So why, on the night of Jan. 25, 2023, was Stephen Matthews still on the app? Just four days before, Match Group had been alerted when another woman reported him for rape. A little more than a week later, he was reported for rape again. This time, the survivor went to the police. None of these women knew that the company had known about his violent behavior for years. He was first reported on Sept. 28, 2020. By then, Match Groupâs safety policy was already in place. Even after a police report, it took nearly two months for Matthews to be arrested â the only thing that got him off the apps. By then, at least 15 women would eventually report that Matthews had raped or drugged them. Nearly every one of them had met him on dating apps run by Match Group. On Oct. 25, 2024, a Denver judge sentenced Matthews to 158 years to life in prison after a jury convicted him of 35 counts related to drugging and sexually assaulting eight women, drugging two women, and assaulting one more for a total of 11 women. Attorneys for the women said much of that violence could have been prevented. “It is shocking that for years after receiving reports of sexual assault, Hinge continued to allow Stephen Matthews access to its platforms and actively facilitated his abuse,â said Laura Wolf, the attorney representing the woman whose police report led to the arrest. Following best practices forÂ reporting on sexual assault, the Dating Apps Reporting Project is honoring survivorsâ requests for anonymity.Â Matthewsâ attorney, Douglas Cohen, declined to comment. A letter that The Dating Apps Reporting Project sent directly to Matthews in jail went unanswered. Match Groupâs reach is so massive â its mission is âto spark meaningful connections for every single person worldwideâ â that people are more likely to meet through its apps than out at the bars, at church, or through friends. But Matthews’ case shows that even as these apps have made it easier for us to connect with a seemingly endless pool of potential lovers, they have also made it easier for people who commit sexual abuse to reach a seemingly endless number of potential targets. In 2022, a team of researchers at Brigham Young University published an analysis of hundreds of sexual assaults in Utah. They found attacks facilitated by dating apps happened faster and were more violent than when the perpetrator met the victim through other means. They also found that perpetrators who use dating apps are more likely to target vulnerable people. Almost 60 percent of sexual assault survivors self-reported a mental illness. Match Group has known for years which users have been reported for drugging, assaulting, or raping their dates since at least 2016, according to internal company documents. Since 2019, Match Groupâs central database has recorded every user reported for rape and assault across its entire suite of apps; by 2022, the system, known as Sentinel, was collecting hundreds of troubling incidents every week, company insiders say. Match Group promised in 2020 that it would release whatâs known as a transparency report â a public document that would reveal data on harm occurring on and off its platforms. If the public were aware of the scale of rape and assault on Match Group apps, they would be able to accurately assess their risk. As of February 2025, the report has not been released. Instead, as people continued to get hurt, the company dithered over what damning information should be hidden. âDo we only publish where we are required by law?â reads a slide in a 2021 presentation shown multiple times to Match Group employees as well as external safety partners. âDo we push back on how much we are required to reveal, or do we try to go beyond what is required?â No online space is risk-free. But while Match Group has long possessed the tools, financial resources, and investigative procedures necessary to make it harder for bad actors to resurface, internal documents show the company has resisted efforts to spread them across its apps, in part because safety protocols could stall corporate growth. âThe obsession with metrics and having to stick with them is frustrating and potentially dangerous,â one employee wrote in 2021 after the company learned that the investigative news nonprofit ProPublica was planning a story. âThis is not the way we were meant to work and peopleâs lives are at risk.â The same person asked their superiors: ââHow much would you personally pay to stop just one person being sexually assaulted by a date, one child being trafficked or one vulnerable person being driven to suicide by a predator?â I feel that if I asked members of our staff that question individually, they would put a high value of their own money on it – But as a group nobody is ready to hear that yet.” Since 2021, Match Group has publicly promised to improve the safety of their products and share data, but company insiders say safety has not improved. A brief hiring spree sparked by congressional and media scrutiny has been largely scaled back, according to former employees. In 2024, the remaining employees from the central trust-and-safety team Match Group set up in response to increased scrutiny were let go and their jobs outsourced to overseas contractors. Facing pressure from Wall Street, Match Group removed CEO Bernard Kim in early February 2025 as he struggled to cut costs and end the steady decline in subscribers to Match Groupâs most powerful app, Tinder. Members of Congress have repeatedly requested data from Match Group on sexual harm. In February 2020, 11 members of Congress wrote to then-CEO Shar Dubey asking for details on how the company responds to reports of sexual violence. In July 2023, two Democrats, then-Rep. Annie Kuster of New Hampshire and Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois followed up after we inquired on the status of their efforts. The company has still not provided the data. In September 2024, the House of Representatives passed a bill that requires consumers to be notified if they have interacted with a user on a dating app who has been banned for defrauding consumers of money or personal financial information. But the bill stopped short of addressing the issue of sexual assault on the apps, and it died in the Senate. Our review of hundreds of pages of internal company documents, along with thousands of pages of court records, securities filings, and analyst reports, coupled with dozens of interviews with current and former employees and survivors of sexual violence found women who report being raped get no traction, while accused rapists like Stephen Matthews keep swiping â and assaulting. Our own testing on Match Group apps shows that as of February 2025, not much has changed. Banned Tinder users, including those reported for sexual assault, can easily rejoin or move to another Match Group dating app, all while keeping most of their key personal information exactly the same. The Dating Apps Reporting Project sent Match Group a four-page letter detailing our findings. The company responded with a short statement. The statement did not dispute that Match Group has carefully documented the extent of harm on company apps for years without sharing that information with the public. It also defended the companyâs efforts to make platforms safe. âWe recognize our role in fostering safer communities and promoting authentic and respectful connections worldwide,â the statement provided by Kayla Whaling, senior director of communications, read. âWe will always work to invest in and improve our systems, and search for ways to help our users stay safe, both online and when they connect in real life.â The company said it vigorously combats violence.Â âWe take every report of misconduct seriously, and vigilantly remove and block accounts that have violated our rules regarding this behavior,â its statement read. Our own testing found otherwise. Starting in April 2024, The Dating Apps Reporting Project created a series of Tinder accounts that we subsequently reported for sexual assault. Soon after, Tinder banned the accounts, and we started investigating how easy it would be for a banned user to create new accounts. Repeatedly, we found that users, soon after being banned, could create new Tinder accounts with the exact same name, birthday, and profile photos used on their banned accounts. Users banned from Tinder were also able to sign up for Hinge, OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish without changing those personal details. To get around the Tinder ban, we used techniques commonly suggested by online guides and forums that donât require lots of technical knowledge to understand. We were able to verify three techniques that allowed banned Match Group users to repeatedly bypass being flagged when creating new accounts. In its statement, Match Group cast itself as an industry leader in deploying technology to promote safety, including âharassment-preventing AI tools, ID verification for profiles, and a portal that helps us better support and communicate with law enforcement investigating crimes. â¦ Every person deserves safe and respectful experiences. We are committed to doing the work to make dating safer on our platforms and beyond,â the statement said. Sept. 28, 2020 â the date Denver cardiologist Stephen Matthews raped a woman who reported him to Hinge â is also the date Tracey Breeden was brought on as Match Group’s head of safety and social advocacy. Breeden was a flashy hire. âWith Tracey coming on board, we are reaffirming our commitment not just to be safety leaders in the dating space, but across the entire tech sector,â then-CEO Shar Dubey said. Sporting a trademark black leather jacket and short, slick-backed hair, Breeden went by the nickname âTornadoâ during her 15-year career in law enforcement. What made her attractive to Match Group was her most recent job at Uber. She helped the global ride-hailing company revive its reputation after a series of scandals â from persistent reports of harassment of women employees to allegations that it was ignoring sexual assault that occurred during Uber rides. Breeden spearheaded a safety report in 2019 that told the public what Uber knew about nearly every problem, including nationwide reports of intoxicated drivers, traffic fatalities, and incidents of sexual violence. The report became a key metric of success for the company. In hiring Breeden, Match Group hoped to replicate this success across its portfolio of apps. “Corporations,â she said in a press release announcing her arrival, âhave a responsibility to help ensure safe experiences for their users.â Breedenâs team garnered public attention for its new safety measures, including partnerships with NGOs, optional AI-assisted photo verification, and a law enforcement portal where police and prosecutors can request data. She also fostered a partnership with Garbo, a startup that offered low-cost background checks. It launched on Tinder in 2022. Experts point out that background checks are not always reliable as they pull from outdated databases, and research suggests that most people who commit sexual abuse do not encounter the criminal justice system. For example, Matthews had no criminal record. During this time, Match Group invested $100 million into safety as a recurring cost, the company said, and boasted about Breedenâs âcentral safety team.â Her team of veteran safety professionals referred to themselves as âThe Avengers,â even donning superhero costumes at company events. But Michael Lawrie called this âsafety theater.â Lawrie worked for Match Group for nearly a decade, shaping and leading a safety team for one of the companyâs smaller brands, OkCupid. Sometimes working 80-hour weeks, he spent hours, even days, sniffing out savvy users who tried to thwart bans by creating multiple accounts. Over a 30-year career in content moderation, Lawrie said, he saw many users like Stephen Matthews. âYou’re dealing with one repeat offender. I’ve dealt with god knows how many repeat offenders,â he said. A yellow Post-it note on the side of Lawrieâs computer listed out some of his responsibilities: âRape flags. â¦ Investigate miscreants.â These days, Lawrie is trying to start an advocacy organization for content moderators and other front-line safety workers. But, he said, heâs done with dating apps. âI donât think theyâre safe enough at the moment,â he said. âTheyâre gonna get worse. â¦Iâm hoping dating sites vanish.â Lawrie said he was initially excited about Breedenâs hire. He said she spent her first few months on the job talking to each brandâs safety team, and told him that she was âvery impressedâ by the work OkCupid was doing. Each of Match Groupâs biggest apps provided their self-described strengths and weaknesses to Breedenâs team, according to an internal spreadsheet. At Hinge, these weaknesses included a âvery rudimentary warning system with no targeted comms and no follow throughâ and âno way to findâ the original profile âof a bad actor who has created multiple profiles.â Breeden was confronted with an existential problem. âOur current ban categories wonât allow us to answer the publicâs biggest question: Am I likely to be harmed on my date?â reads a slide in a presentation drafted by her team in April 2021. While each of Match Groupâs apps had a system of reporting and banning violent users, the information was disorganized, and none of the apps talked to each other. Lawrie hoped Breeden would improve safety at the company. But he quickly grew frustrated that neither she nor Match Group leadership listened to his pleas for what they really needed to make platforms safer: To hire trained â and expensive â investigators and integrate powerful moderation tools across all the apps. OkCupid already had those tools. Lawrie was using them every day. One of those was the Sentinel system, which had been up and running across Match Groupâs apps for at least five years before Breeden arrived. It works like this: When a user is banned for something serious â like sexual assault â a case is created in Sentinel with the phone number and email address associated with their account. In interviews, multiple current and former employees described how those reports circulate through each of Match Groupâs apps. The system is designed to ban anyone who uses that information. It also grabs the original profileâs IP addresses, photos, and birthdate. Such a system seems robust at first glance â but none of the Match Groupâs apps require users to provide photo identification (the kind needed to buy alcohol or board an airplane), so once a person is kicked out, they can easily start a new account with different contact information. A quick search yields scores of online forums with clear steps and suggestions for how to rejoin the apps. In addition, internal company documents show information on IP addresses, photos, and birthdate were not used to ban a user if they appear on another Match dating app. Lawrieâs team at OkCupid knew Sentinel could only do so much. So his team deployed other tools to fix its shortcomings, including one that could automatically ban a profile that was linked to a phone number, photo, or URL that had been previously banned â even if the user made an account with a different email or IP address. This tool was designed to be proactive rather than reactive, so that the profiles of alleged perpetrators like Matthews would not resurface after they had been reported. Internal company documents from 2019 and 2020 show thousands of reports of âserious physical assault,â abuse, or violence on OkCupid that were deemed serious enough to get users banned from all of Match Groupâs apps. This is among the information the company kept from the public. Breeden and Match Group leadership praised Lawrie and his team at OkCupid, he said, for their thorough investigative work and for handling some of the companyâs most difficult cases. Yet, he said, Match Group never built out a skilled, experienced investigative unit at other brands like the one he headed up at OkCupid. Under Breedenâs leadership, he said, they faced pressure to speed up investigations and train outsourced labor to use complicated moderation tools. A week after a damning article in 2021 revealed that content moderators with little training were asked to rapidly deal with violent sexual content across Match Groupâs brands, then-CEO Dubey sent out an all-staff email addressing the controversy. She CCâd Breeden, acknowledging that the brandâs safety teams were not all on equal footing. As Match Group prepared internally for the story to break, Lawrie was asked to write a report for Breeden outlining his teamâs accomplishments âto make sure when Tracey describes and acknowledges what you are doing individually to celebrate the good work that you are doing.â Lawrie used that report to protest. âMost professionals arenât judged on how many cases they can hurry through in an hour,â he wrote. The way Match Group expects its trust-and-safety and support teams to work âbasically diminishes their skills and makes them production-line workers.â Breeden declined to comment for this story, citing a nondisclosure agreement. Lawrie left the company in 2022 and said most of his small team that was ferreting out malicious users also left due to a negative workplace environment. He said much of their work was outsourced to contractors with little training and severe quotas. He now cautions anyone using a dating app to understand that theyâre not in the business of protecting users. âYou’re on your own pretty much,â he said. As Lawrie was getting pushed out of Match Group, Matthews kept appearing on the companyâs apps. One crisp fall evening in 2022, one of the Denver cardiologistâs old medical school classmates was on Hinge when her phone screen filled up with a familiar face. Matthews was being promoted on the app as a Standout, a popular profile that Hingeâs algorithm thinks youâll like. To match with a Standout, users must send the person a rose. They get one free rose a week, but they cost $3.99 a pop after that. His classmate did not send Matthews a rose. By this point, Matthews had already been reported for rape at least once to Hinge. Court documents show that he had already allegedly sexually assaulted nine women and drugged 10. Not only did the apps allow him back on, they featured Matthewsâ profile. As the COVID-19 pandemic dragged on, people got tired of forking money over for dating apps. Match Group still made a hefty profit, but its growth flatlined. Its stock cratered, losing nearly half its value between October 2021 and April 2022. That month, an analyst from J.P. Morgan wrote that the firm had received more messages about âthe underperformance of MTCH shares in recent weeks than any other topic.â In May 2022, Match ousted Dubey and installed Bernard Kim as CEO, a former executive at the gaming company Zynga that popularized viral games like âFarmVille.â While Dubey spoke frequently about trust and safety and worked closely with Breeden, Kim hardly mentioned safety when he began his time at Match Group, instead emphasizing the need for continued rapid expansion to drive long-term shareholder value. Lawrie said that Kim, with his background in gaming rather than dating apps, had no interest in love. âHe just wants to make money. Heâs just there to increase profits,â Lawrie said. âIf he’s looking at a bottom line, then it’s easier to have a lawsuit than it is to provide safety. I know which one he’s gonna pick.â Match Group declined to make Bernard Kim available for an interview. Messages sent to Kim directly went unreturned. While the tension between growth and safety exists across the tech sector, it is especially high at dating apps companies where executives have to worry about constant churn â users leaving the apps when they are no longer looking for dates. Every time Match Group delivers on its promise, it also loses customers. In February 2024, six dating app users filed what they hope will be certified as a class action lawsuit. They argue Match Group uses âaddictiveâ features to encourage compulsive use while not leading to any real increase in off-app relationships. âThe app is designed specifically to hook them, and to keep them paying subscription fees â not to help them find love,â attorney Ryan Clarkson said. Match Group filed to dismiss the lawsuit in September, noting in its quarterly report that it âwill defend vigorouslyâ against the allegations. Despite Kimâs efforts, Match Groupâs stock price continued to drop, and during that time, so did any mention of trust and safety. In over a year of quarterly investor calls, Kim only referenced safety efforts once. Employees who pushed for these initiatives were forced out or laid off, including Breeden â a leader who was so convinced of her own invincibility that she showed up to an event wielding a Captain America shield. Match Group fired its power hire in October 2022. Layoffs hit her team over the next several months. In February 2024, the remainingÂ critical investigators and law enforcement liaisons on Breedenâs central safety team were shown the door. Lawrie said group chats of former Match Group employees have been gossipping about the cutbacks. âYou’re not gonna see them taking safety seriously ever again,â he said, adding that the only thing that he thinks might change that is legislation. Four months before Matthews was arrested, a post on a Facebook group in Denver blew up, right around Christmas. Over and over again, women furiously detailed negative experiences they or their friends had with Matthews. Some women described him as âsketchy.â Others called him âterribleâ and ânot safe.â Multiple women told a similar, dark story: that they were offered drinks, blacked out, and sexually assaulted. The thread reached 150 comments. Two women wrote the same thing: that they had been waiting for someone to post about the cardiologist. The flood of Facebook comments mirrored details in the police reports released the following year. Nearly all of the 16 women included in the district attorneyâs initial complaints were offered tequila. Eight recalled playing Jenga. Six mentioned a hot tub. As these stories circulated in this small corner of the internet in December 2022, the Denver cardiologist stayed on Match Group apps. Those fortunate enough to know about the Facebook group â and who had the foresight to check for Matthews on it â would be saved from a bad date or worse. But the fact that he could still log into Tinder and Hinge left him with a pool of thousands of unsuspecting women whom he could â and would â continue to match with. The Dating Apps Reporting Project is aware of four additional women who have accused Matthews of drugging and/or raping them who were not part of the criminal complaint. Each of these women met Matthews on a Match Group app during a single year between the summers of 2020 and 2021. During the years Matthews was on their apps, Match Group hired and fired Breeden. It made loud promises on sexual violence, announced initiatives and product lines, and promised a transparency report. But it was not straight with the public, which meant the women matching with Matthews on Match Group apps were not aware of the risk they faced. Match Groupâs partnership with Garbo, the background check company, also fell apart in the summer of 2023. âItâs become clear that most online platforms arenât legitimately committed to trust and safety for their users,â Garbo wrote in a searing blog post. After spending so much energy talking about monetization, gamification, and growth, Kim began to publicly acknowledge this problem. Speaking at the Citibank conference in the fall of 2023, he said the company was investing in new features to make sure âwomen have a good experience while they’re in the product. They feel safe. They feel secure. Etc.â The âetc.â does not seem to include increased transparency about safety. Instead, in May 2023, Tinder released a âfemale-focused package,â a curated list of âhigh-quality profiles.â It is unclear how Tinder determines these high-quality matches. Hingeâs Standout feature, which is similar, had previously promoted Matthews. In fact, under Kimâs leadership, all mentions of a transparency report disappeared from the companyâs annual impact report. Ironically, this was around the same time that new legislation in Europe required tech companies to disclose reports of ânon-consensual behaviorâ and other issues. Match Group will be required to submit a transparency report to the European Union on the scope of harm on their platforms later this month. Lawmakers in India and Australia are also demanding transparency. This is exactly the situation Breeden and her team pondered three years ago. âWhat if publishing in one jurisdiction sparks a requirement in another?â read a slide in the same internal presentation where Match Groupâs trust-and-safety leaders wondered whether they should âpush back on how much [they] are required to reveal.â After Match Group published a disappointing earnings report in February 2025 that fell below analystsâ expectations, it also announced that Kim would be replaced by former Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff. Tinderâs revenue, sales, and subscribers had all gone down. As Match Group struggles to reverse its decline, itâs also aware that its reputation is in the spotlight. Earnings calls and shareholder letters over the first three quarters of 2024 indicate that the company knows it is a business imperative to make women feel safer on its platforms. Match Group brought in a new vice president to head trust and safety whose job partly focuses on complying with increased global transparency requirements. The company is experimenting with requiring faces in photos and rolled out a âShare My Dateâ feature so you can be tracked while meeting up with an online stranger. On Tinder, it orchestrated a âmajor ecosystem cleanupâ geared toward identifying fake profiles and getting scammers off the app. But neither the cleanup nor tracking a date from your phone would have stopped Matthews â a man who never sought to hide his identity, who assaulted his dates in his own home â from finding and harming women. Four years after Matthewsâ first documented assault, he walked into a wood-paneled courtroom in Denver and was sentenced to 158 years to life in prison. âI will sentence. I cannot heal,â Judge Eric Johnson told the room filled with survivors and family members. âCountless women have suffered and will continue to suffer,â said Laura Wolf, an attorney who represented the woman whose police report triggered Matthewsâ arrest. âHinge and other dating platforms have taken no steps to ensure the safety of the product they are selling, matching unsuspecting women to known predators without pause or concern.â Match Group didnât make it easy for the Denver prosecutors to convict Matthews. A search warrant was issued to Hinge in July 2023. Two months later, prosecutors were still empty-handed â with the judge in the case asking at a hearing if he needed to start âdragging people in to get stuff done.â It wasnât until February 2024 that the Denver District Attorneyâs Office said they finally received documents returned by Match Group. Matthews will likely never leave prison. Match Group executives currently face no charges. But the company knew about Matthews, and it knows about thousands of other abusive users. It has the data that could help users avoid dangerous situations, but it hasnât shared it, leaving millions of people in the dark. Lawmakers around the world are starting to ask for answers from the most powerful force in modern dating. In June, Colorado passed a law, triggered by the Matthews case, that forces dating app companies to tell the state attorney general what safety measures they are taking to protect users. Although the law leaves room for the possibility of additional transparency in the future, it does not currently require the company to tell the state, or the public, how many people are raped or assaulted after using its platform. In the U.S., weâve just scratched the surface. In most states, thereâs little that requires Match Group to share information with you â or with Congress. The reality is that if Stephen Matthews were released today, he could get right back on a dating app. Match Group knows this â and now so do you. Stephanie Wolf contributed reporting.

Title: How Does Crypto Help Hedge Against Inflation?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/how-does-crypto-help-hedge-against-inflation/
Time Published: 2025-02-15T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Rising food prices are a harmful result of inflation. Can you use crypto to protect your pocketbook? Inflation is the systematic erosion of the purchasing power of money. Governments and central banks often attribute inflation to supply shocks, rising production costs or geopolitical instability. These factors may drive temporary fluctuations in inflation under specific circumstances, but they all stem from a deeper, underlying cause: the relentless expansion of the money supply. Persistent inflation occurs when the growth of the money supply outpaces economic output, reducing the purchasing power of each dollar. In simple terms, when more dollars are printed, each dollar buys less. Fiat currencies like the dollar are vulnerable to inflation because governments can create money at will, and often do so for political expediency. Even in times of economic stability, central banks deliberately try to balance inflation at a rate of 2% annually. This figure traces back to a short-lived policy adopted by the Central Bank of New Zealand in 1989. Somehow it took hold, and the entirely arbitrary 2% target has since been enshrined as economic orthodoxy. The stated reason that 2% inflation is desirable is because it “spurs growth,” though no clear mechanism for how inflation drives economic expansion has been identified. Meanwhile, expanding the money supply devalues government debt, enables unchecked deficit spending and imposes a silent tax on the public, all without the need for legislative approval. Inflation is a certainty, like death and taxes. The purchasing power of your dollars will decline over time; the only question is by how much and how fast. The rational response is to store wealth in assets that rise in price as new money enters the system. Stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities and even some cryptocurrencies serve this function, each with its own risk-reward profile. Investing, at its core, is about front-running inflation. But with every investment comes risk. The wrong bet could leave you worse off than if you had simply held cash. As Warren Buffett warned, “Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Never forget rule No. 1.” If the goal is to hedge against inflation—not gamble on speculative upside—the priority should be asset stability. Historically, the “gold standard” of inflation protection has been, well, gold. It won’t make you rich, but its purchasing power has remained remarkably consistent. An ounce of gold today buys roughly the same amount of land as it did hundreds of years ago. Very few assets can claim that kind of track record. For the first time in history, there is a digital alternative, one that combines gold’s scarcity with superior portability, divisibility and censorship resistance. That asset is bitcoin (and to some extent other cryptocurrencies), and its role in inflation hedging is growing. Unlike fiat money, some cryptocurrencies have fixed supplies and are not controlled by central authorities, making them resistant to inflation. Bitcoin, viewed by some as “digital gold,” is the most prominent example. However, other cryptocurrencies are also sometimes used as inflation hedges. Let’s examine some of the ways crypto can serve as a hedge against inflation. Bitcoin’s monetary policy enforces scarcity. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be printed in unlimited quantities, bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins. This scarcity is enforced by its code and network consensus, making it immune to inflation. Historically, assets with limited supply have been effective inflation hedges. Bitcoin and gold share this quality, but bitcoin has several advantages: it’s more portable, easily verifiable and resistant to confiscation. When inflation accelerates, more investors seek hard assets, and bitcoin will continue to attract investment. Bitcoin operates outside of government and central bank control. No single entity can manipulate its supply or freeze transactions. This independence makes bitcoin especially appealing in economies suffering from currency devaluation or even hyperinflation, where people seek an escape from failing fiat systems. In countries like Turkey and Lebanon where local currencies have collapsed, bitcoin offers a crucial lifeline. Crypto’s borderless nature allows it to function as a global store of value, unbound by the inefficiencies of the traditional banking system. Unlike fiat currencies, which rely on fragmented financial infrastructure and jurisdictional restrictions, cryptocurrency moves seamlessly across the internet, unrestricted by national borders. As inflation accelerates and trust in fiat currencies erodes, people seek alternatives to safeguard their wealth. Gold has long served this purpose, but bitcoin presents unique advantages: it is digital, highly portable and accessible to anyone with an internet connection. For those looking to hedge against monetary debasement, bitcoin stands as a resilient defense against both inflation and currency devaluation. While some altcoins may offer short-term storage of value, their long-term reliability is questionable, making them far too risky to serve as a stable hedge over any meaningful time horizon. A major shift has occurred in recent years as institutional investors recognize bitcoin’s potential as a store of value. With the approval of bitcoin ETFs and firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and BNY Mellon integrating bitcoin into their offerings, institutional participation has surged. This growing demand from institutions adds credibility to bitcoin as a financial asset and strengthens its role as an inflation hedge. Large-scale adoption by hedge funds, corporations, and governments will dampen price volatility and reinforce bitcoin’s value proposition as a long-term store of wealth. Gold and real estate have long been considered inflation hedges, but they have limitations. Gold is difficult to transport and verify, while real estate requires significant capital and lacks liquidity. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offer an alternative that combines the scarcity of gold with the accessibility of digital assets. While bitcoin is the primary inflation hedge, it is not impossible that other cryptos may one day offer alternative strategies to hedging inflation risk. While crypto presents a compelling alternative to fiat, it is not without risks. Investors must consider the following challenges before relying on digital assets as an inflation hedge. Cryptocurrency markets are known for extreme price swings. While bitcoin has appreciated significantly over the long term, it has also experienced sharp drawdowns, sometimes losing 50% or more of its purchasing power in short periods. For investors seeking stability, bitcoin’s volatility can a drawback. However, volatility is not equivalent to risk. One would expect prices to stabilize as bitcoin is widely adopted and liquidity deepens. Meanwhile, bitcoin’s most critical property—monetary integrity—is already established. Unlike fiat currencies, where inflation is a certainty, bitcoin’s fixed supply ensures that its inflation risk is effectively zero. Governments and regulatory agencies continue to grapple with how to classify and control cryptocurrencies. While some countries embrace bitcoin as legal tender or an investment asset, others impose restrictions or outright bans. Regulatory uncertainty can affect price stability and investor confidence. While bitcoin’s decentralized design makes it resistant to outright bans, policies affecting on-ramps (such as exchanges) can still restrict access to it. Bitcoin has, at times, shown correlation with equities, particularly during market selloffs. However, this correlation is situational rather than structural, driven by short-term liquidity crises. When investors need cash quickly, they sell what they can, and bitcoin, as a 24/7 liquid asset, is often included in that category. A study of bitcoin’s correlation with major financial assets from 2013 to 2021 found that it is correlated with risk assets over long time periods, with significant short-term deviations. Recently, this has begun to change. In 2024, bitcoin’s correlation with tech stocks was found to be moderate-to-strong on only 10 out of 262 trading days. Bottom Line Crypto, and particularly bitcoin, offers a unique hedge against inflation due to its fixed supply, decentralization and lack of correlation with other assets. While traditional assets like gold remain relevant, bitcoin is also used as an inflation hedge in the 21st century economy. As inflation continues to erode fiat currencies, bitcoin’s role as an inflation hedge is likely to grow, reinforcing its value proposition as "digital gold." Bitcoin is often compared to gold because it shares key characteristics: it is a bearer asset with widespread recognizeability and a limited supply. However, bitcoin also offers advantages over gold. It is more portable, easy to verify and resistant to censorship. Stablecoins are pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, meaning they do not hedge against the inflation of whichever currency they are pegged to. However, in economies with failing local currencies, people may choose to preserve their wealth using stablecoins pegged to stronger currencies, usually the U.S. dollar. Both assets serve as inflation hedges, but bitcoin offers advantages such as digital portability, ease of transfer and predictable supply. Gold has a longer history, but bitcoin is increasingly recognized as a store of value for the digital age. Bitcoin can be a useful hedge against inflation, but its price volatility means it should be part of a diversified strategy. Investors should conduct thorough research, assess their risk tolerance and may choose to invest carefully over time using dollar-cost averaging. One Community. Many Voices.

[+] sovereign wealth fund reveals a huge bet on bitcoin. Abu Dhabi’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund purchased $436 million worth of BlackRock’s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) during the final quarter of last year, according to a regulatory filing. BlackRock led a campaign to get a spot bitcoin ETF approved in the U.S. through 2023, with a fleet of bitcoin funds making their debut in January 2024 before surging to become some of the fastest growing ETFs of all time. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets for the first time in November, led by BlackRock’s $60 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), giving those holding it exposure to its near-600,000 bitcoin. In recent months, rumor and speculation has swirled that countries and their wealth funds are secretly buying bitcoin, helped by explosive comments from BlackRock’s chief executive in January. “Only scratching the surface, buckle up,” David Bailey, the chief executive of Bitcoin Magazine publisher Bitcoin Inc who advised the Trump election campaign on bitcoin strategy and organzied Trump’s July appearance at a bitcoin conference where he first promised to create a bitcoin strategic reserve, posted to X. “Abu Dhabi has gone in much bigger than today’s filing,” Bailey added. “There’s a couple other GCC members that are making moves too,” referring to the Gulf Cooperation Council that includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Abu Dhabi’s United Arab Emirates. “I told you the race was on,” bitcoin-backing U.S. senator Cynthia Lummis posted to X in response to Abu Dhabi 's filing. “It’s time for America to win.” Lummis, a Republican senator from Wyoming, last year introduced The Bitcoin Act to Congress, calling for the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve to reduce the U.S.'s spiraling, near-$36 trillion national debt by buying 1 million bitcoin over five years.

Time Published: 2025-02-15T11:33:12Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 06:33 EST / FEBRUARY 15 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

Episode 6 – Spending data from ETR shows that robotic process automation is gaining steam in mid-to-large enterprises – A race to improve productivity is driving companies to implement automation in the form of software robots. UiPath and Automation Anywhere show strong customer spending momentum. Blue Prism and other major players, while not showing the same growth, appear to be well-positioned. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave Vellante explains how this market is beginning to re-shape automation for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 5 – Spending data shows that cloud native databases are disrupting traditional analytic data stores. Snowflake and AWS RedShift stand out as having spending momentum based on ETR survey data – Some cloud native databases have been architected to enable storage and compute resources to be scaled independently. This not only improves economics but also drives increased agility and flexibility for many use cases. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave Vellante explains how this dynamic is eating into traditional enterprise data warehouse markets. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 4 – Storage Spending Outlook 2H ’19 – Pure Leads the Pack – The on-prem storage business has been hurt by: 1) the cloud siphoning away demand; and 2) a massive injection of flash storage that has given data center managers enough performance headroom to minimize the need to buy for performance reasons. Pure Storage is growing faster than the marketshare leaders but from a much smaller installed base. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / FEBRUARY 15 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies.

Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / FEBRUARY 15 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR, who will share fresh data, perspectives and insights from the latest survey data.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings.

Each week, Quartz rounds up product launches, updates, and funding news from artificial intelligence-focused startups and companies. Here’s what’s going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry. Adobe (ADBE) released a beta version of its Firefly Video Model to the public this week — the market’s first commercially safe generative AI model for video, according to the company. The AI video model is available through Adobe’s new Firefly app and Premiere Pro with Generative Extend. The Firefly app integrates with Adobe’s other applications such as Photoshop and Express, so creators can use it for text-to-video generation, video storyboards, and more. “Firefly is designed for creative professionals looking for unmatched creative control and IP-friendly tools that can be used safely and effectively in both ideation and production,” David Wadhwani, president of Adobe’s digital media business, said in a statement. “We’ve been thrilled to hear from beta customers who’ve found it a game-changer for ideating concepts and producing stunning videos, and we can’t wait to see how the creative community uses it to bring their stories to the world.” Personal AI startup PIN AI launched a mobile app this week with a native large language model that allows users to protect their data. By having a personal data bank with PIN AI, users can have control over their data, while allowing AI developers access to insights on their behavior, such as their shopping and investing habits, to create personalized AI experiences across apps such as Gmail and social media platforms. “Unlike Big Tech monopolies that hoard data and suppress competition, PIN AI empowers users to protect and control their data,” PIN AI co-founder Bill Sun said. “It’s a revolutionary alternative to the exploitative practices of the current AI landscape represented by Big Tech and rising AI native monopolizers. We’re laying the groundwork for the agent economy where your Personal AI interacts with the external AI agent ecosystem interconnecting individual intent with a world of services.” Chip startup Positron announced a $23.5 million funding round this week for U.S.-made, energy-efficient chips that can be an alternative to Nvidia’s (NVDA). The round was backed by Flume Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Atreides Management, and Resilience Reserve. The startup is already shipping chips to data centers and neoclouds throughout the U.S. “With this funding, we’re scaling at a pace that AI hardware has never seen before–from expanding shipments of our first-generation products to bringing our second generation accelerators to market in 2026,” Mitesh Agrawal, CEO of Positron, said in a statement. “Our solution is growing rapidly because it outperforms conventional GPUs in both cost and energy efficiency, while delivering AI hardware that eliminates reliance on foreign supply chains.” AI video creator Synthesia launched Selfie Avatars this week as part of its AI avatar service. Users can create custom, talking avatars by uploading images of themselves. The Selfie Avatars are experimental, the company said, adding that it has done testing to prevent harmful content such as non-consensual deepfakes. “This feature marks an exciting milestone for Synthesia as we continue to innovate and shape the next generation of AI avatars coming later this year,” the company said in a statement. Chipmaker Groq announced this week that it secured a $1.5 billion commitment from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to expand its partnership and deliver advanced LPU-based AI inferencing infrastructure. In December, Groq built the largest inference cluster in the Middle East, and brought it online in eight days. Saudi Araba is working on its Vision 2030 goal of having an AI-powered economy. “It’s an honor for Groq to be supporting the Kingdom’s 2030 vision,” Jonathan Ross, CEO and founder of Groq, said in a statement. “We are excited to work alongside Saudi innovators to shape the next chapter of AI.”

Title: Letters: GAA players will abandon the game if they continue to be denied a fair share

It costs hurlers, and footballers, to play for their counties. Photo: Sportsfile The startling report by Frank Roche (‘Net zero cost for players is the GPA goal… or else GAA’s amateur status is at risk’, Irish Independent, February 13) is most alarming. An independent report commiss­ioned by the Gaelic Players Association (GPA) and produced by Indecon on their behalf found individual GAA players incur an average net expense loss of €4,602 a year to participate at inter-county level. GPA chief executive, former Mayo midfielder Tom Parsons, predicted that unless the Government and Croke Park step up to ensure inter-county players, male and female, no longer have to pay for the privilege, a growing number will turn their backs on the county game. It’s hard to blame them when they take such a serious hit to the pocket. Many counties are contracting ever-growing management teams on lucrative financial deals, while the GAA players run the risk of injury every time they tog out. When these county players see large management teams being richly rewarded for their time in an amateur sport while they lose thousands of euro on an annual basis, is it any wonder they are inclined to revolt. And who can blame them for looking for their fair share of the national cake? Tom Towey, Cloonacool, Co Sligo When news of the “Blackrock scandal” appeared, I wrote letters to three national newspapers asking a simple question: “What type of applicants for the priesthood were rejected?” Only one paper, the Irish Independent, published my letter and nobody provided an answer. I’m now asking again. Mattie Lennon, Blessington, Co Wicklow The provision of an adequate supply of new houses and apartments is going to be critical to this Government over the next five years. This administration has projected that 300,000 new units will be built over the next five years. There are many commentators who think this number will not be enough or that we will never get to that level of construction. I found the recent report from Mitchell McDermott Construction Consultants to be rather damning. In essence, this consultancy firm is asking what the chances are of getting to 300,000 builds over the next five years, especially if one were to base the number on what has been happening in the last couple of years. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary Labour leader Ivana Bacik has come under fire from some quarters for her reasonable demand to solve the housing crisis by incurring debt. The fact is, since independence, this is how public housing has been provided and many more government services to the people. The Republic of Ireland has a very good record in international finan­ces, in particular with the IMF. It is totally misleading and erroneous to state each Irish citizen owes even one cent of national debt. The national debt of €224bn is minuscule compared with the UK at £2.7tn and US at $36tn. A government cannot be run like a household – if it was, many nations would not have clean water, proper sewage disposal, health services and much more. Empirical evidence trumps propaganda any day. Declan Foley, Melbourne, Australia If Ireland’s universities continue down a profit-driven path, students may soon graduate with more experience in corporate finance than in their actual fields of study (‘As colleges become cash cows, students get milked dry’, Irish Independent, February 14). The creeping commercialisation of higher education means degrees now come with price tags that overshadow their true value, while teaching staff are treated as disposable. At this rate, the best lesson students will learn is how to fend for themselves in an institution that increasingly resembles a business park rather than a place of learning. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran, Armagh On August 15, 1998, a beautiful day, I went for my usual daily swim off Tramore beach, Rosbeg, Co Donegal. On my way home to Glenties at around 3pm, I remember well listening to the radio and hearing the sickening news of bombs going off on Omagh’s main street. Now, 26 years later, I’m listening every day to the horrific stories from various people who were caught up in that evil act. How impossible it is to hold back the tears. What more can one say? Man’s inhumanity to man. Brian McDevitt, Glenties, Co Donegal I agree with your editorial that the Taoiseach’s visit to Washington and, presumably, to the White House, should be an opportunity to promote peace (‘Taoiseach can use St Patrick’s visit to US to promote peace’ – Irish Independent, February 13). I would avoid all mention of Trump’s beautiful word, “tariffs”, and focus on peace and how Ireland itself is the beneficiary of the great contribution of the US in achieving peace and prosperity. The G word, “great”, should be the trigger at every opportunity for our Taoiseach, should he meet with President Trump. First and foremost, it is an opportunity to congratulate Trump on his “great” victory. Micheál Martin should repeat that word “great” as often as possible, including his great efforts with the ceasefire in Gaza and his great efforts in pushing Putin and Zelensky to negotiate, even if Trump is trying to tie Ukraine’s hands. I sense a slight disappointment in Europe that Trump is acting the big man in all things Gaza and Ukraine. We should never forget that the US also needs Europe to secure its own prosperity and security. Ending the bloodshed is worth giving peace a chance. A great price has already been paid by both Ukraine and Russia. Should we not be happy if Trump can help achieve a way out for both parties?

Title: Meet The Peter Thiel Acolytes in Donald Trump’s 2nd Administration

Editor Tech Derrick Broze, Independent media alliance, The Last American Vagabond As we approach the third week of Donald Trump’s 2nd presidential term, it is once again clear that Peter Thiel is having an outsized influence on the administration. Peter Thiel is the infamous co-founder of Palantir, the “private” surveillance firm with a long history of involvement and collaboration with the CIA. Thiel is also a Steering Committee Member of the Bilderberg Group, the infamously secretive group which represents the interests of the hidden ruling class. Now, in the second Trump administration, Thiel’s influence is more visible than ever as numerous associates and acolytes of his are set to play various influential roles. I’ve previously reported how Thiel and others in the right-wing of Big Tech decided to go all-in on Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign. They argued that this was a defensive move to protect their industries from the encroachment of the Biden/Harris administration. However, despite the hesitance of many of the Silicon Valley CEO’s to embrace Trump in 2016 and 2020, Thiel has a long history of supporting the two-time president. In 2016, Thiel donated $1.25 million to Donald Trump’s first presidential campaign. Despite claiming to have tired of politics and not publicly supporting Trump in 2020 and 2024, Thiel was absolutely a behind-the-scenes advocate for a 2nd Trump term. While speaking at the All In Summit in early October 2024, Thiel claimed that while he was not donating money to any political candidate, he was still supporting Donald Trump and now-Vice President JD Vance “in every other way possible”. “I am still very strongly pro-Trump, pro-J.D.,” Thiel said. Peter Thiel States He Is Still Supporting Donald Trump and JD VanceWhile speaking at the All In Summit, Peter Thiel claimed that he is not donating money to any political candidate in 2024, but is still supporting Donald Trump and JD Vance "in every other way possible". pic.twitter.com/Gt4ak1OIag Despite his years long embrace of Donald Trump, it is also worth noting that Thiel collaborated with the Biden administration. In 2021, I reported on how the Biden administration was receiving criticism for continuing Trump’s plans for a border wall in the form of a “virtual” or biometric wall. One of the contractors for the virtual wall was Anduril Industries, founded by Trump donor Palmer Luckey with funding from Peter Thiel. The message was clear — whether with Trump, Biden, or Harris the U.S. is getting a biometric surveillance state with Digital IDs. Fast forward to 2025, and now that Trump and Vance are occupying the White House, numerous Thiel-affiliated companies are expected to see a big boost in financial revenue. For example, recently Thiel’s Palantir and Anduril, as well as SpaceX and OpenAI, announced a partnership on U.S. military contracts. The move marks the latest efforts by the Technocrats to replace the old guard of the Military Industrial Complex — companies like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Boeing. This article is a brief look at the many Thiel-connected members of President Donald Trump’s 2nd cabinet. This list is not exhaustive and should be updated with time as more disciples of the Thielverse come into play. Despite not giving directly to the 2024 Trump campaign, Thiel has gained well-deserved scrutiny for his role in financing the rise of Vice President J.D. Vance. Vance, the 40-year-old former Ohio Senator, was in attendance at David Sacks’ June 2024 fundraiser for Trump. Sacks is the partner of Craft Ventures, the former Chief Operating Officer of PayPal. According to “two people with knowledge of the exchange”, during the June event Trump “informally polled the room” regarding who he should choose for his Vice Presidential running mate. David Sacks, Chamath Palihapitiya, and others all told Trump he should choose Vance. Elon Musk also reportedly encouraged Trump to pick Vance. A few weeks later at the Republican National Convention that’s exactly what Donald Trump did. Thiel and Vance have an extensive relationship. Vance claims that after hearing Peter Thiel deliver a speech at Yale Law School in 2011 he was inspired to pursue a career in big tech firms. He started as a junior investor with the Thiel-backed Mithril Capital in 2016. Vance briefly worked at biotechnology firm Circuit Therapeutics, a move which then-CEO Frederic Moll told the NY Times was a “favor to Peter.” In 2019, Vance would found his own venture firm, Narya Capital, with financial backing from the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, the billionaire investor Marc Andreessen, and, of course, Peter Thiel. When Vance announced his run for Ohio Senator, Peter Thiel was there and gave $15 million to the campaign. With this money Vance was able to secure a victory and within two years he was on the way to the White House with the full support of Thiel and other technocrats. While Musk is a powerful and influential technocrat in his own right — choosing to maintain a more public personality than that of Thiel — he and Thiel have their own history of collaboration. Elon Musk and Peter Thiel have been friends for more than two decades and both men received massive financial wealth from their co-founding of PayPal. Thiel has also been a prominent investor in Musk’s various ventures, including Neuralink. People keep saying that X is a "Free Speech" space.Everyone should know that Elon and X are completely inundated within the Peter Thiel Capital Web. Elon Musk, first involved with Peter Thiel when his online banking site https://t.co/01wzux4BwW (not this platform!) was… pic.twitter.com/QzmZXUh2Xz Musk and Peter Thiel also co-founded “America PAC” as their vehicle to support Trump’s return to the White House. In July 2024 it was initially reported that Musk would invest $45 million a month into the Trump campaign. In the end, Musk would give nearly $75 million to the PAC. As promised, Trump nominated Musk to lead the “Department of Government Efficiency”. While the idea of reducing government waste and increasing efficiency is an appealing proposition, it should also be noted that Musk’s talk of efficiency is reminiscent of the little known Efficiency Movement which predated the more well-known Technocracy movement. The Efficiency Movement sought to identify and eliminate waste in all areas of the economy and society, and to develop and implement “best practices”. Supporters of the movement included Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. Rockefeller was a proponent of efficiency, stating, “To help an inefficient, ill-located, unnecessary school is a waste …it is highly probable that enough money has been squandered on unwise educational projects to have built up a national system of higher education adequate to our needs, if the money had been properly directed to that end.” Is the goal of Trump and Elon to make government more efficient to serve the people? Or, is the goal to finally fulfill the dream of the original technocrats and eliminate the political and business classes in favor of “machines” (Artificial Intelligence), centrally planning, and managing society? Time will tell. David Sacks is most well-known for his involvement in the early days of PayPal, serving as the COO with Thiel as the CEO. He is considered a member of the so-called “PayPal Mafia”, a name given to the founders of PayPal who later founded numerous tech companies, including Tesla, LinkedIn, Palantir Technologies, SpaceX, YouTube, and Yelp. In 1998, Thiel and Sacks co-authored the book, The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism and Political Intolerance on Campus, arguing that political correctness has harmed the college education system and academia in general. The book expanded on the pair’s writings in The Stanford Review, a student-run newspaper founded by Thiel and Sacks in 1987. Peter Thiel and Sacks would later apologize for statements made in the book which belittled rape. In June 2024, Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya hosted a fundraiser for Trump at Sacks’ home in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco. The meeting netted the Trump campaign $12 million after Trump reportedly said he would be “the crypto president”. It was this dinner where the billionaires told Trump he should choose Vance as his running mate. Shortly after his victory in the 2024 election, Trump rewarded Sacks for his loyalty by appointing him as the “AI and Crypto Czar”. In this position Sacks is expected to greatly influence the U.S. government’s policies on cryptocurrency, and the advancement of AI. Howard Lutnick is the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald investment firm and has become a vocal proponent for Bitcoin in the last couple years. Lutnick is also an investor in anti-ESG Strive Asset Management, which was founded by Vivek Ramaswamy. Peter Thiel, the Founders Fund, and J.D. Vance’s Narya Capital also contributed to Strive’s $30 million funding round. Lutnick is also a part owner of video platform Rumble, founded by Chris Pavlovski. In December 2021, Pavlovski announced his intention to take Rumble public by combining forces with CF Acquisition Corp, a division of the Lutnick’s Cantor Fitzgerald. The deal was completed by September 2022 with CF Acquisition Corp providing “approximately $400 million in gross proceeds” to help “build out Rumble’s independent infrastructure”. “With its massive growth in users and engagement, this is an exciting time for Rumble to become public. I am excited to see ‘RUM’ shares trading in the marketplace,” Lutnick said at the time of the deal. Following Rumble becoming a publicly traded company, the top institutional share holders include Cantor Fitzgerald, Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street, and Rockefeller Capital Management, among others. In August 2024 I reported on Howard Lutnick’s appearance at the 2024 Bitcoin Nashville event and his involvement in the Bitcoin community more broadly. During his own speech at Bitcoin Nashville, Trump called Lutnick “one of the truly brilliant men of Wall Street”. That Trump sees Lutnick — one of the most high profile traders of U.S. debt and a Wall Street regular — as a brilliant man is likely a sign that Wall Street banks will continue to influence U.S. financial policy under Trump’s 2nd administration. Lutnick was also formerly a neighbor to Jeffrey Epstein in NYC and raised millions for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 Presidential campaign. Lutnick has spoken at the World Economic Forum’s various meetings as far back as 2016 and as recently as January 2023. At the 2023 WEF meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Lutnick participated in a panel titled, Real Estate at a Turning Point. Another interesting facet of Lutnick’s personal story is that Cantor Fitzgerald’s offices were located in the 101st to the 105th floors of One World Trade Center. The firm lost 658 of its 960 employees due to the terrorist attack. However, Lutnick happened to be accompanying his wife as she took their son to his first day of kindergarten. Donald Trump has appointed Jim O’Neill as deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). O’Neill has extensive connections and collaborations with Peter Thiel. O’Neill worked at two of Peter Thiel’s funds, Clarium Capital and Mithril Capital Management from 2012 to 2019. In 2010, he co-founded Peter Thiel‘s Thiel Fellowship. He also worked as the CEO of the Thiel Foundation from 2009 to 2012. From 2019 to July 2021, O’Neill was the CEO of SENS Research Foundation, an organization focused on “rejuvenation”. The SENS received its initial funding from Peter Thiel in 2006 and 2008, a fact that should come as no surprise given Thiel’s own interest in fighting aging using the blood of the young. Whitney Webb recently wrote a detailed investigation further outlining O’Neill’s connections to Thiel and how his appointment might be used to stifle Robert F. Kennedy Jr. if his nomination is confirmed in the coming weeks. Trump named Ken Howery as his pick for U.S. ambassador to the Kingdom of Denmark. Howery previously served as a U.S. ambassador to Sweden, and Trump wrote that he “served our Nation brilliantly” in that role. The connections between Howery, Peter Thiel, and the World Economic Forum run deep. Apparently, Trump sees those connections as a net positive. Howery was another PayPal co-founder with Thiel. The pair also co-founded the venture capital fund Founders Fund. In March 2012, the WEF named Howery a member of the Young Global Leader program. He is also a member of the Selection Committee for the World Economic Forum Technology Pioneers Program. Howery may have been selected for the role of ambassador to Denmark to help Trump fulfill his goal of annexing Greenland. Denmark has administrative control over Greenland as part of its kingdom. Interestingly, Trump’s calls for purchasing Greenland and making it part of the United States mirrors the original Technocrats plan for the “Technate of America”, including Canada and Panama as well. Jacob Helberg was appointed to be undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and the environment. Helberg donated $2 million to Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. He is an ardent supporter of Israel and a former supporter of Democrats who has said his shift to Trump was a result of Democrats becoming “anti-Israel”. While the Democrats also support Israel and generally vote to give the nation unlimited funding and weapons stockpiles, Helberg believes they are not sufficiently obedient. Helberg is also a senior adviser to Palantir Technologies, the private surveillance firm co-founded by Peter Thiel. Helberg also is also senior advisor to Alex Karp, Thiel’s co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies. Donald Trump has named Michael Kratsios to serve as science adviser and director of the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy. Kratsios also served in the role in the first Trump White House and the Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. Kratsios led the 1st Trump admin’s policy specialist on artificial intelligence, drones, quantum computing, and cybersecurity. Kratsios worked for two of Peter Thiel’s funds, Thiel Capital and Clarium Capital. Although Vivek Ramaswamy is no longer involved in DOGE, he is still in Trump’s orbit and has announced a run for Governor of Ohio. It would not be surprising to see Peter Thiel invest in his political campaign. Thiel previously invested in Ramaswamy’s fund, Strive Asset Management. Trae Stephens is a partner at venture capital firm Founders Fund, which was organized by Peter Thiel, Ken Howery, and Luke Nosek in early 2005. Stephens is also the co-founder and chair of Anduril Industries, which was funded by Peter Thiel. Finally, Stephens worked for Thiel’s Palantir Technologies. According to Bloomberg,Trump and his team have consulted with Trae Stephens. Politico has also previously reported that Shyam Sankar, current Palantir chief technology officer, has been considered for the Pentagon’s top research and engineering job. Finally, Blake Masters, who worked for Thiel Capital and for the Thiel Foundation, was reportedly up for nomination as Trump’s head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) at one point. Alex Karp is the co-founder of Palantir Technologies Inc. Karp co-founded Palantir with fellow technocrat Peter Thiel with the assistance of two rounds of investment from CIA’s venture capital firm In-Q-Tel. Karp is also a steering committee member of the Bilderberg Group. While Karp has mostly stayed out of politics in the public sphere, in 2024 he told the NYT that he was now supporting Kamala Harris. While Karp has traditionally supported Progressive politicians and described himself as a radical leftist, and Thiel has supported Conservative politicians, both men are now united in the support of the Trump administration. While there may be real political differences between Karp and Thiel, there is not daylight between the two when it comes to Technocratic solutions. Karp recently told Fox Business how Palantir is ready and willing to help make the U.S. government “more efficient”. Karp is also an open advocate for supporting the Zionist movement. Researcher James Corbett recently noted that, “in November of last year, Palantir issued a letter to shareholders that stressed the company’s support for Israel’s quest to ethnically cleanse Palestinians.” “We are one of a few companies in the world to stand up and announce our support for Israel, which remains steadfast,” Karp wrote in the letter. “Palantir stands with Israel.” Thiel has also made it clear he will not interfere in Israel’s crimes and has no qualms supplying technology which leads to civilian deaths. First, in January 2024 Palantir announced that it had signed a “strategic partnership” with the Israeli Defense Ministry to supply technology for the genocide. In May 2024, protesters accused Thiel of complicity in ‘genocide’, blocking his vehicles for over an hour while he was speaking at the Cambridge Union. Over two hundred students gathered outside the Cambridge Union attempting to “drown out” Thiel’s talk. When Thiel was directly questioned about his support of Israel and their use of AI technology to murder humans, he gave a rambling non-answer. “Look again . . . I’m not . . . I’m not . . . you know, you know . . . with . . . without, without going into all the . . . you know I’m not on top of all the details of what’s going on in Israel, because my bias is to defer to Israel. It’s not for us to to second-guess every, everything. And I believe that broadly the IDF gets to decide what it wants to do, and that they’re broadly in the right and that’s, that’s sort of the perspective I come back to.” When Thiel was asked about #Palantir using its artificial intelligence to help the IDF commit genocide: https://t.co/UCnXCNIu4h pic.twitter.com/BhPh9LVBca Given that Karp and Thiel are willing to turn a blind eye to the crimes of Israel, it should come as no surprise that Trump’s 2nd cabinet is stacked with former and current associates of Thiel’s who also share this zeal for Zionism and Technocracy. Now that we understand the depths at which Peter Thiel’s influence can be seen and felt in the Trump administration, we must ask — who exactly is influencing Peter Thiel’s actions and thinking? In my next article I will dive deeper into the role that Curtis Yarvin aka Mencius Moldbug has played in influencing Peter Thiel and the MAGA movement in general.

Title: Meet The Peter Thiel Acolytes in Donald Trump’s 2nd Administration

Editor Tech Derrick Broze, Independent media alliance, The Last American Vagabond As we approach the third week of Donald Trump’s 2nd presidential term, it is once again clear that Peter Thiel is having an outsized influence on the administration. Peter Thiel is the infamous co-founder of Palantir, the “private” surveillance firm with a long history of involvement and collaboration with the CIA. Thiel is also a Steering Committee Member of the Bilderberg Group, the infamously secretive group which represents the interests of the hidden ruling class. Now, in the second Trump administration, Thiel’s influence is more visible than ever as numerous associates and acolytes of his are set to play various influential roles. I’ve previously reported how Thiel and others in the right-wing of Big Tech decided to go all-in on Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign. They argued that this was a defensive move to protect their industries from the encroachment of the Biden/Harris administration. However, despite the hesitance of many of the Silicon Valley CEO’s to embrace Trump in 2016 and 2020, Thiel has a long history of supporting the two-time president. In 2016, Thiel donated $1.25 million to Donald Trump’s first presidential campaign. Despite claiming to have tired of politics and not publicly supporting Trump in 2020 and 2024, Thiel was absolutely a behind-the-scenes advocate for a 2nd Trump term. While speaking at the All In Summit in early October 2024, Thiel claimed that while he was not donating money to any political candidate, he was still supporting Donald Trump and now-Vice President JD Vance “in every other way possible”. “I am still very strongly pro-Trump, pro-J.D.,” Thiel said. Peter Thiel States He Is Still Supporting Donald Trump and JD VanceWhile speaking at the All In Summit, Peter Thiel claimed that he is not donating money to any political candidate in 2024, but is still supporting Donald Trump and JD Vance "in every other way possible". pic.twitter.com/Gt4ak1OIag Despite his years long embrace of Donald Trump, it is also worth noting that Thiel collaborated with the Biden administration. In 2021, I reported on how the Biden administration was receiving criticism for continuing Trump’s plans for a border wall in the form of a “virtual” or biometric wall. One of the contractors for the virtual wall was Anduril Industries, founded by Trump donor Palmer Luckey with funding from Peter Thiel. The message was clear — whether with Trump, Biden, or Harris the U.S. is getting a biometric surveillance state with Digital IDs. Fast forward to 2025, and now that Trump and Vance are occupying the White House, numerous Thiel-affiliated companies are expected to see a big boost in financial revenue. For example, recently Thiel’s Palantir and Anduril, as well as SpaceX and OpenAI, announced a partnership on U.S. military contracts. The move marks the latest efforts by the Technocrats to replace the old guard of the Military Industrial Complex — companies like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Boeing. This article is a brief look at the many Thiel-connected members of President Donald Trump’s 2nd cabinet. This list is not exhaustive and should be updated with time as more disciples of the Thielverse come into play. Despite not giving directly to the 2024 Trump campaign, Thiel has gained well-deserved scrutiny for his role in financing the rise of Vice President J.D. Vance. Vance, the 40-year-old former Ohio Senator, was in attendance at David Sacks’ June 2024 fundraiser for Trump. Sacks is the partner of Craft Ventures, the former Chief Operating Officer of PayPal. According to “two people with knowledge of the exchange”, during the June event Trump “informally polled the room” regarding who he should choose for his Vice Presidential running mate. David Sacks, Chamath Palihapitiya, and others all told Trump he should choose Vance. Elon Musk also reportedly encouraged Trump to pick Vance. A few weeks later at the Republican National Convention that’s exactly what Donald Trump did. Thiel and Vance have an extensive relationship. Vance claims that after hearing Peter Thiel deliver a speech at Yale Law School in 2011 he was inspired to pursue a career in big tech firms. He started as a junior investor with the Thiel-backed Mithril Capital in 2016. Vance briefly worked at biotechnology firm Circuit Therapeutics, a move which then-CEO Frederic Moll told the NY Times was a “favor to Peter.” In 2019, Vance would found his own venture firm, Narya Capital, with financial backing from the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, the billionaire investor Marc Andreessen, and, of course, Peter Thiel. When Vance announced his run for Ohio Senator, Peter Thiel was there and gave $15 million to the campaign. With this money Vance was able to secure a victory and within two years he was on the way to the White House with the full support of Thiel and other technocrats. While Musk is a powerful and influential technocrat in his own right — choosing to maintain a more public personality than that of Thiel — he and Thiel have their own history of collaboration. Elon Musk and Peter Thiel have been friends for more than two decades and both men received massive financial wealth from their co-founding of PayPal. Thiel has also been a prominent investor in Musk’s various ventures, including Neuralink. People keep saying that X is a "Free Speech" space.Everyone should know that Elon and X are completely inundated within the Peter Thiel Capital Web. Elon Musk, first involved with Peter Thiel when his online banking site https://t.co/01wzux4BwW (not this platform!) was… pic.twitter.com/QzmZXUh2Xz Musk and Peter Thiel also co-founded “America PAC” as their vehicle to support Trump’s return to the White House. In July 2024 it was initially reported that Musk would invest $45 million a month into the Trump campaign. In the end, Musk would give nearly $75 million to the PAC. As promised, Trump nominated Musk to lead the “Department of Government Efficiency”. While the idea of reducing government waste and increasing efficiency is an appealing proposition, it should also be noted that Musk’s talk of efficiency is reminiscent of the little known Efficiency Movement which predated the more well-known Technocracy movement. The Efficiency Movement sought to identify and eliminate waste in all areas of the economy and society, and to develop and implement “best practices”. Supporters of the movement included Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. Rockefeller was a proponent of efficiency, stating, “To help an inefficient, ill-located, unnecessary school is a waste …it is highly probable that enough money has been squandered on unwise educational projects to have built up a national system of higher education adequate to our needs, if the money had been properly directed to that end.” Is the goal of Trump and Elon to make government more efficient to serve the people? Or, is the goal to finally fulfill the dream of the original technocrats and eliminate the political and business classes in favor of “machines” (Artificial Intelligence), centrally planning, and managing society? Time will tell. David Sacks is most well-known for his involvement in the early days of PayPal, serving as the COO with Thiel as the CEO. He is considered a member of the so-called “PayPal Mafia”, a name given to the founders of PayPal who later founded numerous tech companies, including Tesla, LinkedIn, Palantir Technologies, SpaceX, YouTube, and Yelp. In 1998, Thiel and Sacks co-authored the book, The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism and Political Intolerance on Campus, arguing that political correctness has harmed the college education system and academia in general. The book expanded on the pair’s writings in The Stanford Review, a student-run newspaper founded by Thiel and Sacks in 1987. Peter Thiel and Sacks would later apologize for statements made in the book which belittled rape. In June 2024, Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya hosted a fundraiser for Trump at Sacks’ home in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco. The meeting netted the Trump campaign $12 million after Trump reportedly said he would be “the crypto president”. It was this dinner where the billionaires told Trump he should choose Vance as his running mate. Shortly after his victory in the 2024 election, Trump rewarded Sacks for his loyalty by appointing him as the “AI and Crypto Czar”. In this position Sacks is expected to greatly influence the U.S. government’s policies on cryptocurrency, and the advancement of AI. Howard Lutnick is the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald investment firm and has become a vocal proponent for Bitcoin in the last couple years. Lutnick is also an investor in anti-ESG Strive Asset Management, which was founded by Vivek Ramaswamy. Peter Thiel, the Founders Fund, and J.D. Vance’s Narya Capital also contributed to Strive’s $30 million funding round. Lutnick is also a part owner of video platform Rumble, founded by Chris Pavlovski. In December 2021, Pavlovski announced his intention to take Rumble public by combining forces with CF Acquisition Corp, a division of the Lutnick’s Cantor Fitzgerald. The deal was completed by September 2022 with CF Acquisition Corp providing “approximately $400 million in gross proceeds” to help “build out Rumble’s independent infrastructure”. “With its massive growth in users and engagement, this is an exciting time for Rumble to become public. I am excited to see ‘RUM’ shares trading in the marketplace,” Lutnick said at the time of the deal. Following Rumble becoming a publicly traded company, the top institutional share holders include Cantor Fitzgerald, Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street, and Rockefeller Capital Management, among others. In August 2024 I reported on Howard Lutnick’s appearance at the 2024 Bitcoin Nashville event and his involvement in the Bitcoin community more broadly. During his own speech at Bitcoin Nashville, Trump called Lutnick “one of the truly brilliant men of Wall Street”. That Trump sees Lutnick — one of the most high profile traders of U.S. debt and a Wall Street regular — as a brilliant man is likely a sign that Wall Street banks will continue to influence U.S. financial policy under Trump’s 2nd administration. Lutnick was also formerly a neighbor to Jeffrey Epstein in NYC and raised millions for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 Presidential campaign. Lutnick has spoken at the World Economic Forum’s various meetings as far back as 2016 and as recently as January 2023. At the 2023 WEF meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Lutnick participated in a panel titled, Real Estate at a Turning Point. Another interesting facet of Lutnick’s personal story is that Cantor Fitzgerald’s offices were located in the 101st to the 105th floors of One World Trade Center. The firm lost 658 of its 960 employees due to the terrorist attack. However, Lutnick happened to be accompanying his wife as she took their son to his first day of kindergarten. Donald Trump has appointed Jim O’Neill as deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). O’Neill has extensive connections and collaborations with Peter Thiel. O’Neill worked at two of Peter Thiel’s funds, Clarium Capital and Mithril Capital Management from 2012 to 2019. In 2010, he co-founded Peter Thiel‘s Thiel Fellowship. He also worked as the CEO of the Thiel Foundation from 2009 to 2012. From 2019 to July 2021, O’Neill was the CEO of SENS Research Foundation, an organization focused on “rejuvenation”. The SENS received its initial funding from Peter Thiel in 2006 and 2008, a fact that should come as no surprise given Thiel’s own interest in fighting aging using the blood of the young. Whitney Webb recently wrote a detailed investigation further outlining O’Neill’s connections to Thiel and how his appointment might be used to stifle Robert F. Kennedy Jr. if his nomination is confirmed in the coming weeks. Trump named Ken Howery as his pick for U.S. ambassador to the Kingdom of Denmark. Howery previously served as a U.S. ambassador to Sweden, and Trump wrote that he “served our Nation brilliantly” in that role. The connections between Howery, Peter Thiel, and the World Economic Forum run deep. Apparently, Trump sees those connections as a net positive. Howery was another PayPal co-founder with Thiel. The pair also co-founded the venture capital fund Founders Fund. In March 2012, the WEF named Howery a member of the Young Global Leader program. He is also a member of the Selection Committee for the World Economic Forum Technology Pioneers Program. Howery may have been selected for the role of ambassador to Denmark to help Trump fulfill his goal of annexing Greenland. Denmark has administrative control over Greenland as part of its kingdom. Interestingly, Trump’s calls for purchasing Greenland and making it part of the United States mirrors the original Technocrats plan for the “Technate of America”, including Canada and Panama as well. Jacob Helberg was appointed to be undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and the environment. Helberg donated $2 million to Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. He is an ardent supporter of Israel and a former supporter of Democrats who has said his shift to Trump was a result of Democrats becoming “anti-Israel”. While the Democrats also support Israel and generally vote to give the nation unlimited funding and weapons stockpiles, Helberg believes they are not sufficiently obedient. Helberg is also a senior adviser to Palantir Technologies, the private surveillance firm co-founded by Peter Thiel. Helberg also is also senior advisor to Alex Karp, Thiel’s co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies. Donald Trump has named Michael Kratsios to serve as science adviser and director of the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy. Kratsios also served in the role in the first Trump White House and the Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. Kratsios led the 1st Trump admin’s policy specialist on artificial intelligence, drones, quantum computing, and cybersecurity. Kratsios worked for two of Peter Thiel’s funds, Thiel Capital and Clarium Capital. Although Vivek Ramaswamy is no longer involved in DOGE, he is still in Trump’s orbit and has announced a run for Governor of Ohio. It would not be surprising to see Peter Thiel invest in his political campaign. Thiel previously invested in Ramaswamy’s fund, Strive Asset Management. Trae Stephens is a partner at venture capital firm Founders Fund, which was organized by Peter Thiel, Ken Howery, and Luke Nosek in early 2005. Stephens is also the co-founder and chair of Anduril Industries, which was funded by Peter Thiel. Finally, Stephens worked for Thiel’s Palantir Technologies. According to Bloomberg,Trump and his team have consulted with Trae Stephens. Politico has also previously reported that Shyam Sankar, current Palantir chief technology officer, has been considered for the Pentagon’s top research and engineering job. Finally, Blake Masters, who worked for Thiel Capital and for the Thiel Foundation, was reportedly up for nomination as Trump’s head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) at one point. Alex Karp is the co-founder of Palantir Technologies Inc. Karp co-founded Palantir with fellow technocrat Peter Thiel with the assistance of two rounds of investment from CIA’s venture capital firm In-Q-Tel. Karp is also a steering committee member of the Bilderberg Group. While Karp has mostly stayed out of politics in the public sphere, in 2024 he told the NYT that he was now supporting Kamala Harris. While Karp has traditionally supported Progressive politicians and described himself as a radical leftist, and Thiel has supported Conservative politicians, both men are now united in the support of the Trump administration. While there may be real political differences between Karp and Thiel, there is not daylight between the two when it comes to Technocratic solutions. Karp recently told Fox Business how Palantir is ready and willing to help make the U.S. government “more efficient”. Karp is also an open advocate for supporting the Zionist movement. Researcher James Corbett recently noted that, “in November of last year, Palantir issued a letter to shareholders that stressed the company’s support for Israel’s quest to ethnically cleanse Palestinians.” “We are one of a few companies in the world to stand up and announce our support for Israel, which remains steadfast,” Karp wrote in the letter. “Palantir stands with Israel.” Thiel has also made it clear he will not interfere in Israel’s crimes and has no qualms supplying technology which leads to civilian deaths. First, in January 2024 Palantir announced that it had signed a “strategic partnership” with the Israeli Defense Ministry to supply technology for the genocide. In May 2024, protesters accused Thiel of complicity in ‘genocide’, blocking his vehicles for over an hour while he was speaking at the Cambridge Union. Over two hundred students gathered outside the Cambridge Union attempting to “drown out” Thiel’s talk. When Thiel was directly questioned about his support of Israel and their use of AI technology to murder humans, he gave a rambling non-answer. “Look again . . . I’m not . . .

In my next article I will dive deeper into the role that Curtis Yarvin aka Mencius Moldbug has played in influencing Peter Thiel and the MAGA movement in general.

If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Hello! Welcome back! As the dust settles from a chaotic trade deadline, the waiver wire is chock-full of attractive options. The top three names are all-leagues must-adds, While the recent deadline is a part of the story for most of this week's top adds, injuries also factor heavily. Whatever the cause, however, the result is what matters. And the result is that we have a waiver wire deep enough that Quentin Grimes, fresh off a 30-9-4 performance Wednesday night, is relegated to the "other recommendations" section. It's a good week to be making some cuts and adding some players. Programming note: there will be an article next week; same time, same place. However, since there will only be 10 NBA games between now and then due to the All-Star break, that piece will be a more zoomed-out look at potential rest-of-season options. It will ignore players benefitting from short-term injuries or apparent hot streaks, and will try to highlight some players who have gotten less attention in this space so far. As always, the players in this article must be rostered in less than two-thirds of CBS leagues. Players are listed in the order that I recommend adding them, assuming they are equally good fits for your team. Caris LeVert, Hawks (37% rostered) After taking one game to get acclimated, LeVert has taken on a gigantic role in his new home. The Hawks shipped out starting wing De'Andre Hunter at the trade deadline, with LeVert a key piece of the return package. At the time, few viewed it as a one-for-one replacement – however, apparently, that's how coach Quin Snyder saw it. Though LeVert isn't starting, he's played 33.5 minutes over the last two games (neither were blowouts), averaging 19-9-5 with 2.5 threes. If this workload persists after the break, then LeVert will be one of the deadline's biggest and most unexpected winners. Donovan Clingan, Trail Blazers (60% rostered) Robert Williams (knee) missed the last two and a half games, while Deandre Ayton (calf) missed the last one and a half. Clingan took full advantage of the cleared-out depth chart, posting 21-7 in 21 minutes on Monday and followed by a massive 17-20 in 31 minutes on Wednesday. Jerami Grant (knee) was also out for both games, which probably helped a bit, but Grant's impact on the centers is relatively tangential. With Ayton out for at least four weeks (and Williams always in-and-out with his myriad injuries), Clingan should have an extended runway of excellent production ahead. Keon Johnson, Nets (45% rostered) Johnson is coming off back-to-back down games, so his roster rate is likely to dip over the break. Seize the opportunity. If you missed out on him, trade for him. If another manager gets impatient, snag him. Over the previous eight games, he averaged 18-5-3 with 2.0 stocks and 2.0 threes. There was no change in the rotation or available players in those two down games, he was just shooting poorly and took slightly fewer shots as a result – his supplemental stats were consistent with his recent averages. Johnson remains an all-leagues must-add. Carlton Carrington, Wizards (50% rostered) Kyshawn George, Wizards (23% rostered) Before the trade deadline, Kyle Kuzma and Jonas Valanciunas ranked second and third in Wizards' usage rates at 27% and 24%, respectively. With their usage and combined 47.7 minutes per game now out of town, the youth movement is in full effect. Bilal Coulibaly (83% rostered), Carrington, and George have all seen huge boosts in their value – by the way, if you're lucky enough to be in a league where Coulibaly is still available, stop reading right now and go add him (then come back, finish reading, and add Carrington or George). Since the trade, Coulibaly is averaging 11-6-5 with 1.4 steals and 1.2 threes while playing 36.0 minutes per game. George has been arguably equally productive, putting up 15-7-2 with 3.3 threes and 1.5 steals across 34.3 minutes per game. At some point, Marcus Smart, acquired at the deadline, will presumably make his debut and cut into their workloads. Even when that occurs, however, both should maintain some value. Matas Buzelis, Bulls (56% rostered) Buzelis has started four straight with Lonzo Ball (knee) out. He's up to 14-4-1 with 1.3 blocks and 1.8 threes in 26.0 minutes in eight games since Zach LaVine's last time in a Bulls uniform. The rookie has established himself as a solid option right now while still maintaining untapped upside as his minutes increase and he continues to improve. Max Christie, Mavericks (52% rostered) Naji Marshall, Mavericks (29% rostered) A lot is happening in American politics these days, and it's easy to miss breaking news. That's why it's gone so underreported that the new administration has made it illegal for the Dallas Mavericks to have healthy players. In the past week, Daniel Gafford (knee) has joined the newly acquired Anthony Davis (abductor) and Dereck Lively (ankle) on the sidelines. All three are done for February, and Davis is the only one with any real chance to return before the end of March. P.J. Washington (ankle) missed three games for the birth of his child, and then didn't even get a full game back before getting hurt. He's game-to-game. Well, when everyone else is hurt, someone's gotta play. To his credit, Christie is playing very well in his expanded role. While Marshall will probably return to the standard league fringe once Washington is back, Christie's value seems as though it may last until Davis gets healthy*. *Assuming the courts overturn the executive order that currently prohibits healthy Mavericks. Nick Smith, Hornets (30% rostered) The Hornets lost Brandon Miller (wrist) and Tre Mann (back) for the season, limiting their wing depth. When they thought they were acquiring Dalton Knecht at the trade deadline, they shipped out Vasilije Micic and Cody Martin in a separate agreement – only to have the Knecht deal rescinded. And, as always, LaMelo Ball (ankle) is struggling to stay on the court. The result of all this is a ton of available minutes and very few players to take them. Smith was ejected early on Wednesday, but he was averaging 34.8 minutes in the five games before that. He's converted that extra runtime into 20-3-3 with 3.2 threes. He provides no defense and his stats are buoyed by an unsustainably hot shooting streak, but he's worth adding all the same. Bol Bol, Suns (30% rostered) Bradley Beal (toe, this time) missed the last four games before the All-Star break. In a delightful turn of events, the primary beneficiary this time was Bol, who stepped in and averaged 16-7-1 with 3.3 blocks, 1.0 steals, and 2.3 threes while playing 30.0 minutes per game. It feels like the distant past now, but it was not so long ago that Bol was projected as a potential No. 1 overall pick. He's only 25 years old. Of course, it is unlikely that Bol is finally experiencing a sustainable breakout that so many of us had given up hoping for. But Beal does miss a lot of games, and 25 is still pretty young, and the Suns are desperately short on rotation pieces, so, maybe? Dare we dream? Aaron Wiggins, Thunder (33% rostered) Cason Wallace (shoulder) got hurt early in the Thunder's first February game, opening up a big opportunity for Wiggins. To say Wiggins is making the most of it would be a gross understatement. Wiggins is averaging 21-6-2 with 3.1 threes and 1.1 steals in February, numbers not even his own parents thought he was capable of. The surge exactly coincides with Wallace's injury, implying that Wallace's return will mean the return of Wiggins to the waiver wire. Since Oklahoma City has been treating Wallace as game-to-game, and they are about to get a full week off for the All-Star break, it's possible that means Wiggins might not have many more games left where he can help us. Other recommendations: Jordan Clarkson, Jazz (65% rostered); Quentin Grimes, 76ers (28% rostered); Yves Missi, Pelicans (55% rostered); Brandin Podziemski, Warriors (52% rostered); Rui Hachimura, Lakers (63% rostered); Jaxson Hayes, Lakers (29% rostered); Moussa Diabate, Hornets (33% rostered); Quinten Post, Warriors (10% rostered) Am I highlighting Post here only because he is a Boston College graduate? How dare you. Of course I am. But, also, homerism aside, he's making a legitimate impact. He has a Fantasy-friendly game and has clearly overtaken Trayce Jackson-Davis on the depth chart. As long as Post gets enough minutes, he can be a solid source of point and threes, and he doesn't hurt in FT%. The biggest question is how many minutes will he get. The Warriors have had four games since Jimmy Butler arrived, and they've been at near full health through all four (Gary Payton missed the fourth game, and Jonathan Kuminga has been sidelined since early January; otherwise, everyone has been available for all four games). They experienced massive midseason roster turnover, but some trends appear to be emerging. Their top five (Steph Curry, Butler, Draymond Green, Podziemski, Moses Moody) is stable. There is a clear "next five", and Post is in that group. What is not yet clear is whether Post will be towards the top or bottom of that group, which will determine his Fantasy viability. On Thursday, when he struggled from the field and the starters played extra minutes, Post saw just seven minutes of action. On Saturday, he shot 70% from the field and played 20 minutes, seventh most on the team. Markelle Fultz, Kings (3% rostered) There's a reason he was a free agent until last week. Fultz is a fine player, but he's not great. On the other hand, the Kings traded away their only real point guard, and after only five games decided they needed to hire outside reinforcements. Fultz was a DNP-CD Thursday, the first game he was available for the Kings. That's not a great sign, but it's also not something to over-index on when it comes on the last night before the All-Star break. Keep your expectations low, but there's a chance he earns a role and contributes.

Title: Federal Workers Rise up Against Musk, Trump and Drastic Cuts

Time Published: 2025-02-14T20:45:00Z

Chris Dols was one of hundreds who flooded to the streets of Washington, D.C. this week to protest the shutdown of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB was one of the few remnants of the 2008 financial crisis that actually aimed to help ordinary people. The workers locked out of the agency spoke about their jobs, the value of the work they did, reminding themselves and their audience that federal employees have vital jobs that working Americans rely on. Naturally, that’s placed it in the crosshairs of Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which has so far functioned like a private hit squad, moving in and out of various government offices in what Reuters, based on the analysis of two Republican experts, called ​“an ideological assault on federal agencies long hated by conservatives.” Dols, a founding member of a new network of federal workers organizing to counter the attacks from President Donald Trump and Musk, thought the targeting of CFPB clarified what Musk and Trump’s real agenda is. “[The CFPB] is the protection for consumers against fraud,” he said. ​“The grifters went after the anti-grifting agency.” If Trump and Musk really cared about cutting waste and fraud and improving the lives of working people, he noted, they’d be strengthening and expanding the CFPB’s reach, rather than slashing it. Lauren, a worker with the Bureau of Land Management who did not want to give her last name for fear of being targeted, noted that while Musk is bragging about returning the CFPB’s budget ​“to the taxpayers,” that’s pennies compared to the $21 billion the CFPB has returned to Americans who’d been ripped off by financial institutions since its inception in 2011. “I don’t know if people have already forgotten how devastating that financial crisis was and how many lives it upended,” she said. Dols, Lauren and the other members of the Federal Unionists Network (FUN) have been preparing for Trump’s assault on the public workforce and swung into action in the months since his election. (All of the workers I spoke to for this article provided their job title and union membership for ID purposes only and stressed they are only speaking in a personal capacity, not on behalf of their employer or their union.) Those workers are engineers like Dols — who works at the Army Corps of Engineers as a dredging expert and is president of Local 98 of International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE) — but also healthcare providers, legal experts, and other professionals who, together, make up a federal workforce of more than two million now under threat of removal by an administration bent on wreaking havoc on the very idea that government can improve the lives of its citizens. They’ve called for a day of action on February 19, and more broadly, for federal workers and anyone who wants to save public services to step up and learn to organize. “We have a ton to learn from all the people who are going to come in,” Dols said. ​“Everybody needs to become an organizer right now.” In addition to opposing DOGE’s roving hits, the FUN has focused on Trump’s offer to buy out federal workers. The offer has Musk’s fingerprints all over it — the email making the original buyout offer was titled ​“Fork in the Road,” the same title Musk used in a similar email to Twitter employees when he acquired the social networking site — and a number of unions have filed multiple lawsuits against the buyout. But a judge removed a freeze placed on the offer while the lawsuits proceeded on Wednesday, at least temporarily allowing it to go forward. (In These Times reached out to Musk Friday with questions about this article and have not yet received a response.) Whether it is legally halted or not, Dols pointed out, the buyout has fallen short of the administration’s hopes. Something like 3% of the workforce has reportedly accepted the buyout — as Dols noted, in a given year, the turnover due to retirement or normal resignation is closer to 5%. ​“Federal workers obviously don’t trust it, they feel this is an attack. This is a scam.” The court’s decision to let the buyout proceed, he said, ​“should show us that it’s going to be up to organized labor to wage the fight and not to trust the courts.” “They know they’re creating a crisis. It’s intentional,” Dols said. ​“They think they can manage the crisis. They wouldn’t create it if they didn’t think they could manage it. Our job is to make it unmanageable.” “Many of these things that we’re seeing from this administration are designed to strike fear into people,” Colin Smalley, also with the Army Corps of Engineers and president of Local 777 of IFPTE, told me. ​“And a lot of folks out there have been building community in anticipation of this. They’ve been building a place to turn to, whether that’s organized labor or whether it’s the folks that you do a community garden with or your church or whatever it is that you can turn to be with other people and accomplish something together. To me, that’s the work that beats this division and chaos.” Smalley, like Dols, began organizing federal workers within and beyond his union a few years ago, and the two of them ran on a joint ticket for IFPTE leadership in 2024, highlighting the danger that a potential Trump victory posed to the federal workforce. While the Trump/​Musk chaos is unprecedented in recent history, he said, their tactics are recognizable: ​“They use some of the same tactics as traditional union busting tactics in the private sector, that these so-called union avoidance firms preach,” he said. ​“One of the reasons we knew it was going to be bad is because things have been getting bad before January 20. They were getting bad before November. Things have been getting bad for working people for a long time.” Being prepared for a Trump return was a form of inoculation, Dols added. ​“You talk about what might happen so that people are prepared for it so that when they actually encounter it, it’s not the first time that it’s happening to them, and it’s not totally disorienting.” The network now known as FUN grew out of a campaign to confirm former President Joe Biden’s nominees to the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA, the agency which manages labor relations for the federal workforce), and evolved into a grassroots rank-and-file network across unions and agencies across the country. Mark Smith, an occupational therapist and health educator with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in San Francisco, as well as president of National Federation of Federal Employees Local 1, explained, ​“We really wanted a way to connect with each other and learn from each other and build a bit more of a fighting labor movement in the federal sector, to defend the public sector and public services more broadly from just the 40 year assault on public services in this country.” The challenge for organized labor in this moment, Dols said, is to move away from a mobilization strategy — bring people to a rally, wave some placards, and go home — to ​“an actual mass participation organizing model.” That means building, day by day, bigger, stronger unions, adding new members and training the ones that exist. ​“We need orders of magnitude more people learning how to take action and organize action and compel their coworkers into action. That’s the only way we’re going to have the forces in place that can win these arguments, let alone win elections.” Part of their strategy, he added, is being willing to challenge the Democrats on their failures — something that much of the labor movement has been unwilling to do, and if it has, it’s often been to cozy up to Trump instead. Those early campaigns didn’t succeed — those Biden nominees were never, in fact, confirmed, nor did Dols and Smalley win national leadership — but each attempt brought in new members and taught them more about what federal workers wanted and needed. The network now known as the FUN was small, compared to the massive federal workforce, but it was in the right place when Trump was announced the winner in November, and ready to fight. “People were looking for where to go to resist what was coming,” Dols said. ​“We’re in the middle of this massive growth spurt.” Their upcoming day of action on February 19 is in some ways a structure test, to see the breadth of that growth in action. Under the slogan ​“SOS, Save Our Services,” they are at once making a distress call to the broader public, and providing a visible pole of attraction for people to join. That call has already been working — ​“The federal workforce is awakening,” Smith said — as workers rush to join the various federal unions. (The entire federal sector is open shop, meaning workers don’t have to be members of the union to receive the benefits of its collective bargaining.) “I’ve had more people sign up for the union in the last week than in six months previously. As we say in the labor movement” Smith said, ​“a bad boss is the best organizer.” To Smalley, it’s important to show the country the real work that federal employees do, to counter Musk’s railing about ​“unelected” bureaucracy. ​“The Right now loves to call us unelected bureaucrats. The idea is that these unelected bureaucrats are somehow making decisions that are unaccountable to the public when the reality couldn’t be further from the truth for most federal workers.” (Musk, of course, was also not elected by anyone.) Many people, those who may have voted for Trump and believed in his promises to cut government waste, but also those who broadly oppose his policies, don’t really know what the federal workforce looks like, where it’s located, or the variety of jobs it contains. But federal workers are all over the country, in every community, in cities and on rural lands. The government, Smalley said, ​“looks like books in our libraries. It looks like trees in our parks. It looks like people getting the healthcare that they need, and folks that have contributed to their communities for a full life aren’t destitute and suffering on the street. These guys are trying to take a torch to the entire concept that we should care about each other as humans.” Lauren, for instance, works for the Department of the Interior in New Mexico. ​“The majority of the American public does not even know about the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), what we do and the extent to which we operate,” she said. ​“It is a huge contribution to economic development, but also in terms of what we’re addressing and facing with climate change, environmental justice, we’re really at that nexus for those issues.” And during the last Trump administration, they brought the hatchet down on BLM headquarters, forcing a relocation to Colorado from D.C., and dispersed others around the country. Many employees left their jobs rather than move, and Trump has pointed to this strategy as something he’d like to replicate this time around. MT Snyder, meanwhile, another FUN member, is a field examiner with the National Labor Relations Board in San Francisco. Her day-to-day is conducting union representation elections and investigating unfair labor practice charges for private sector workers. “I drive all over Northern California to any facility where there’s going to be a union election and manually conduct these elections, secret ballot elections using paper ballots and a cardboard box.” She studied labor relations in graduate school and wanted to dedicate her life to supporting workers’ right to organize. This is true of many federal employees, Smith said. ​“This administration has kind of shot itself in the foot multiple times already with the emails they’re sending to two million federal employees saying that you should consider a high productivity job in the private sector and get away from your low productivity job in the public sector,” he said. The physicians and nurses and other healthcare professionals at the VHA, he said, could work anywhere, but chose public service, and telling them that they are ​“low productivity” has only fired them up. Those VHA workers are all over the country: they are psychologists, social workers, speech therapists, chaplains, health scientists, researchers, pharmacists, and doctors and nurses. ​“They come for the mission of serving veterans, and then also avoiding much of the moral injury that I think happens in the private sector where you’re not able to deliver the care that you would want to be able to because people can’t pay or the insurance company doesn’t want to pay.” Beyond the VHA, the union Smith belongs to, the NFFE, represents workers in the forest service, including the kinds of wildland firefighters that have been desperately needed to fight the recent wildfires in Southern California. There are National Park Service workers who might lose their seasonal jobs with Trump’s hiring freeze, park rangers who, Lauren said, ​“are living in trailers because they can’t afford housing in the communities that they serve.” “This idea that we’re overpaid and not doing our jobs and are only located in D.C. is just patently false,” she said. ​“They’re acting like our agencies are overfunded and inefficient, but we’re basically accomplishing our missions on drastically reduced budgets.” The IFPTE, Smalley said, represents workers like him, at the Army Corps of Engineers, who do things like prevent flooding and help with disaster recovery — again, deeply necessary work after this year’s violent storms — and ecosystem restoration. “We represent the scientists and engineers as well as the folks that work on the business end of things with the money and the economists and planners. But we also have equipment mechanics, lock and dam operators, crane operators. There’s a tugboat crew that we represent on the Great Lakes.” And those people, Snyder added, those rank-and-file workers across a wide array of industries, job titles, unions and states, are fighting to keep providing those services — and fighting for the idea of government as something that provides for people at all. “My office is full of attorneys who could double their income by moving to the private sector,” Snyder said. ​“I think that Musk and this administration don’t understand how much public servants care about the work that they do. And we’ll fight to make sure that the public will continue to benefit from our services.” The battle to save public services predates Trump and his alliance with Musk. ​“Outsourcing and privatization has been increasing exponentially for more than a decade, including under both Democrat and Republican appointees,” Smith said. The Supreme Court’s decision in Janus v. AFSCME (2018) made the rest of the public sector open shop, a move that built on decades of demonizing public employees, from teachers to social workers, as greedy leeches draining the pockets of ordinary working people. In 2010, a wave of Republican governors like former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker attempted to crush public workers’ unions on the state level, and Trump and Musk are out to do the same on the federal level. That effort has led to some overheated, verging-on-unhinged rhetoric from the Right. Russ Vought, Trump’s choice to run the Office of Management and Budget, has said ​“We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected. When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.” (Not to be outdone, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said during his failed presidential campaign that he would ​“start slitting throats” in the federal bureaucracy.) Democrats, meanwhile, rarely succeed in undoing these attacks. ​“When the Democrats are in power, it tends to be that everything is about bipartisanship and compromise. And so rather than making strides forward, we’re making small strides back,” Smalley said. ​“Whereas in Republican administrations, generally we’re getting thrown as far back as they possibly can, and we’re in a defensive mode.” Nearly every worker I spoke with mentioned chronic underfunding at their agencies, chronic pressure to do more with less. The attacks on the federal sector are just the beginning, Lauren noted. ​“They’re not going to stop with us.” The public sector is, after all, still one of the few bastions of good employment — while it pays less than private sector work, the stability, protections, and sense of mission compensate, or at least, they have in the past. “We are the proof to the American working class that there is a better way. You don’t have to be peeing in a bottle in the back of an Amazon van or working 80 hours a week,” Smalley said. ​“Those of us who work in government, a lot of us came specifically for the better working conditions. And the people like Elon Musk are trying to destroy that status quo so that they can gaslight all of America into forgetting that there’s a better way.” If they succeed, there will be a trickle-down effect on the rest of the country, just not the one that Republicans have long promised. Rather than money, it’ll be shoddy working conditions that spread. Trump has already fired members of the NLRB and the FLRA, preventing those authorities from doing their jobs, despite the law stating that those members can only be removed ​“for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, but for no other cause.” Employers can essentially flout the law, secure in the knowledge that the board can’t act to stop them. Despite all the shock and awe, Snyder said, workers are digging in, and her union’s members are more engaged than ever. ​“We’re having emergency meetings, we are coming up with ideas, we’re making our own pins, making our own slogans. Members of my local know that this fight is dire. The stakes are incredibly high.” The incursions by DOGE have been shocking, Smalley noted, and reach well beyond the employees at places like the CFPB. ​“They are attempting to corporatize every square inch of the federal government.” Most notably, DOGE has accessed the Treasury payments system, and databases which contain, according to one Associated Press article, ​“information about individual and business taxes, medical records, Social Security payments and numbers, and government payments, as well as a long list of other personal data, such as birthdates, home addresses and phone numbers, military records and disability information.” The process is chaotic, sloppy, and while the cruelty is, as so many have noted for years, the point, it is also true that it is not a well thought out process. ​“I work in the Department of Defense, and we’ve seen the phrase ​‘national security’ applied at least three different ways,” Smalley said, to exempt and then un-exempt workers from freezes, cuts, buyouts and layoffs. Beyond the cruelty, the economic impact of the massive layoffs that the administration is considering would be massive. The demonization of public sector workers tends to ignore the fact that decently paid public employees do in fact pay taxes, shop in local stores and online, and contribute to the stability of their communities. If they lose jobs en masse, there will be ripple effects in local economies. The fight is, at the end of the day, about the very nature of government, Smalley said. ​“The way that coming together as a community has been organized in this country is through government. Government is not some abstraction, some monolithic thing. It’s people in our community serving each other.” To beat Trump and Musk at their own game, Dols said, the fightback will have to be broader than one union or one sector, even one as massive as the federal sector. “All the unions that are keeping their head down hoping that they don’t come after them [should know] they’re coming after everybody. The sooner you stand up with each other, the better,” he said. ​“You make the argument that this is an attack on the public by the billionaires. So which side are you on?” The February 19 day of action is an opportunity to pick a side, and to demonstrate it. One part of it will be online — the FUN is asking people to post pictures of themselves wearing red, white and blue and describing the services they provide, if they’re a federal worker, or how they benefit from those services if they’re not. They should get together in person, to take photos but also to be seen in public, to invite others to join. They’re also calling in-person rallies, including at Tesla stores all across the country, Snyder said. “This is about showing each other that we can be courageous together,” Smalley said, ​“and that in the face of the attempts to make us afraid and to make us divided and to make us feel hopeless, that we can turn all of those narratives with something as simple as coming together to remind ourselves why we do our jobs, why we come to work, no matter where that work is.” Supporters can join those events, but it’s also important, Smith said, for regular people to be calling their members of Congress — Democrat or Republican — and demand that the attacks on public servants stop. If they’re union members in a different sector, they can call on their union to support the federal workers’ efforts. It is a moment, the workers all stressed, to be building bridges rather than demanding ideological purity. As the effects of Trump’s cuts and attacks are felt, Smalley said, ​“People who have traditionally thought that they didn’t have much in common with working class people, maybe they don’t identify as part of the working class, they’re going to be affected, and they’re going to need that same community that we’re building right now, and we’re going to be here ready to work with them.” At the same time, Dols stressed, it is a moment for political education, for focusing on the billionaires and others who are materially benefiting from Trumpism. “They are rich because we are poor,” he said. ​“And if they want to say let ​‘er rip so that the economy booms, it’s just going to exacerbate all of the contradictions that gave rise to all of the regulations that are in place. The establishment is forgetting that the labor protections enforced by the NLRB, and the regulations that are enforced by various regulatory agencies, were all put in place to stabilize the system because the system is crisis prone.” This requires, again, organizing beyond a few social media snaps and reposts. The Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee (EWOC) is starting a project focusing on organizing federal workers who don’t already have a union, Dols said, and despite the stifling of the various labor boards, workers can still behave like a union whether or not they’re legally recognized. As for FUN, ​“We’re going to do everything we can to maximize our surface area, create opportunities for people to come in and take ownership over it,” Dols said. They want to build a democratic mass organization out of the network, and to do that, they need to organize a lot of new members. The fight ahead is going to be a marathon, not a sprint — a phrase well beyond cliché at this point, but it’s one worth remembering in this moment. ​“Some of us who are inclined to sprint — and God knows I’m inclined to sprint — have to make sure we’re making strategic choices to scale up in a way that’s sustainable because part of their crisis plan is to burn us out,” Dols continued. “Those of us who are already in the trenches need to pace ourselves in a way that we can survive this long run and in the process, enlist and train as many other people to walk and then to jog and then to run alongside us,” he said. “This isn’t going to be solved by a handful of really clever organizers. It’s going to be solved by an army of organizers mobilizing the broader public to make this crisis unmanageable for ​‘em.” Sarah Jaffe is a writer and reporter living in New Orleans and on the road.

During the fourth quarter of last year, Mubadala scooped up $436 million worth of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, according to a quarterly report disclosing U.S. equity ownership filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Totaling 8.2 million in shares of the Nasdaq-listed iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, it appeared that Friday’s disclosure represented a fresh investment by Mubadala in the product. A filing from the previous quarter did not disclose holdings in BlackRock’s $56.3 billion spot Bitcoin ETF. Mubadala did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt. As President Donald Trump’s administration mulls the prospect of a so-called strategic crypto reserve, which may include Bitcoin alongside other cryptocurrencies, some market participants described Mubadala’s move as indicative of an emerging race on a global scale. “Other countries have started moving,” Swan’s Head of Private Clients and Family Offices Steven Lubka said on X (formerly Twitter). Several governments already hold Bitcoin, including the U.S., China, the United Kingdom, and El Salvador, according to CoinGecko. However, the crypto data aggregator noted in an August report that the $32.7 billion sum largely stems from seizures related to criminal activity. As one of the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi is part of a growing crypto sector in the Middle East. Last summer, the Blockchain Center in Abu Dhabi launched, saying it “will focus on creating a thriving ecosystem that supports startups, enterprises, and academic institutions through a range of comprehensive services and initiatives.” Though the U.S. may assert itself as a Bitcoin backer through Trump’s proposed stockpile, plenty of states have pushed for investing in cryptocurrencies on their own. While two states have rejected Bitcoin reserve bills, similar legislation is either pending or actively being considered in 21 states, according to Bitcoin Reserve Monitor.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs Get $2 Million Boost From National Bank Of Canada
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-get-2-million-boost-from-national-bank-of-canada/
Time Published: 2025-02-14T20:00:13Z
Full Content:
The National Bank of Canada has ventured boldly into the realm of cryptocurrencies. The bank has made $2 million investments in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), changing the way conventional finance views digital assets. This choice emphasizes the evolving scene of controlled crypto investments and the increasing institutional curiosity in Bitcoin. The National Bank of Canada decided on ETFs instead of directly purchasing Bitcoin, following a pattern among financial institutions looking for controlled access to the digital asset. By means of Bitcoin ETFs, one can invest in Bitcoin free from the complications of direct ownership, including security of private keys or navigating cryptocurrency exchanges. This investment also coincides with a period of erratic BTC prices, which have lately ranged between $95,000-$97k. 🚨 National Bank of Canada Invests $2M in Bitcoin ETFs 🇨🇦💰 Canada’s sixth-largest commercial bank ($462B in assets) just made a bold move into Bitcoin, purchasing $2M worth of Bitcoin ETFs. 🏦 Institutional adoption is accelerating, with traditional financial giants deepening… pic.twitter.com/aLuBGjUbed — Blockchain North (@BlockchaiNorth) February 13, 2025 Regarding the reception of Bitcoin ETF, Canada is setting the benchmark. The action of the National Bank of Canada is in line with those of other big multinational companies like as BlackRock, which lately started the iShares BTC Trust in the US. The growing participation of conventional banks and asset managers suggests that Bitcoin is starting to acquire popularity as a choice of investment. Despite the surrounding buzz, detractors of ETFs contend they do not provide the advantages of direct Bitcoin ownership. Although ETFs depend on outside custodians, direct ownership of the cryptocurrencies gives investors total control over their money. ETF investments often come with management fees that could cut possible returns. Still, the National Bank of Canada seems to consider ETFs as a safer, more readily available way to expose to Bitcoin free from direct ownership and related legal concerns. Bitcoin’s increasing engagement with the financial sector suggests that digital assets are gradually becoming a part of traditional finance. If additional businesses follow suit, crypto acceptance might increase even more, which would improve its price and market dynamics. The National Bank of Canada’s $2 million investment, albeit tiny at the moment, reflects a broader trend of mainstream financial actors adopting Bitcoin as a long-term asset. As interest in Bitcoin ETFs grows, it is uncertain whether other banks will follow suit, potentially bridging the gap between traditional banking and the cryptocurrency market.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: AIL previews: Clontarf and Cork Con clash could affect course of season

Time Published: 2025-02-14T19:13:00Z
Full Content:
Turning into the homeward straight of this season’s AIL, the meeting of third-placed Clontarf and leaders Cork Con at Castle Avenue is a meeting of two heavyweights that will probably have a significant impact on the playoff picture. Clontarf (43 points) trail Con (47 points) by four points with a game in hand and rarely lose two in a row. They’re also strengthened by the return of two frontrow stalwarts of recent years in loosehead Ivan Soroka and prolific hooker Dylan Donnellan, both of whom missed last week’s defeat in Young Munster, as well as the Connacht and ex-Ireland Sevens flyer Andrew Smith at fullback. However, the champions are unbeaten in eight. They also welcome back experienced centre Niall Kenneally after his seasonal reappearance off the bench last week. Rob Jermyn shifts to the wing, and Matthew Bowen returns at fullback, while lock Eoin Quilter and flanker Seán Duffy are recalled. Another game of major significance is between sixth and seventh, namely Lansdowne and Young Munster (each on 36 points) on the Aviva back pitch in what looks like a must-win tie for both to retain their playoff hopes. Lansdowne, who’ve won three of their last four, are unchanged, whereas Young Munster are without three of their Munster contingent – Shay McCarthy, Jake O’Riordan and Evan O’Connell – and Adam McBurney. That said, they do have Ruadhán Quinn, who scored two tries last week. The Terenure exodus continues, with Conor Phillips rejoining the Ireland Sevens and Chris Cosgrave going to Japan as a medical joker. Spanish under-20 centre Yago Fernandez makes his first start, with Jules Fenelon recalled on the wing, while Adam La Grue reverts to fullback and Aran Egan to outhalf as Caspar Gabriel is on Leinster duty this weekend. Sitting second on 45 points and unbeaten in seven, Terenure travel to City of Armagh, who are without two casualties from last week in goal-kicking fullback Kyle Faloon and centre Matthew Hookes. Armagh’s results haven’t reflected their competitiveness. Last week’s 31-19 loss away to Con was actually their heaviest of the season and they haven’t lost a home game by more than four points and beat Terenure away in October A very settled St Mary’s will look to return to winning ways at home to UCD, who will be without the Leinster trio of Ben Brownlee, Diarmuid Mangan and James Culhane this week. Mikey Yarr starts at hooker as Bobby Sheehan, with nine tries this season, moves to number eight. Garryowen have picked Munster academy outhalf Dylan Hicks at fullback, while Kelvin Langan starts at No 10 at home to playoff chasing Ballynahinch, who welcome back Ulster and Ireland Sevens winger Zac Ward. Old Belvedere (59 points) can take a giant stride towards the 1B title and automatic promotion at home to third-placed Old Wesley (43). Similarly, an experienced Instonians (53 points) can tighten their grip on 2A and a fourth successive promotion at home to the youthful Corinthians (49), who have played a game more in second. Last October Corinthians inflicted one of only four defeats on Instonians in their last 48 AIL matches, in which they have registered 46 offensive bonus points. Saturday (kick-off 2.30 unless stated) Energia All-Ireland League Men Division 1A: City of Armagh v Terenure College, Palace Grounds; Clontarf v Cork Constitution, Castle Avenue; Garryowen v Ballynahinch, Dooradoyle; Lansdowne v Young Munster, Aviva Stadium back pitch; St. Mary’s College v UCD, Templeville Road.

Title: The Gloves Are Off: Amazon’s Quebec Layoffs Spark Backlash
URL: https://goodereader.com/blog/commentary/the-gloves-are-off-amazons-quebec-layoffs-spark-backlash
Time Published: 2025-02-14T19:01:12Z

Good e-Reader 14 February 2025 by Angela Waterfield Leave a Comment Amazon’s recent decision to shut down all seven of its Quebec warehouses, laying off more than 1,900 workers, is more than just another round of corporate restructuring—it’s a flashpoint in the ongoing battle between multinational corporations and labor unions. The Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN), representing the affected workers, has wasted no time launching legal action, seeking to annul the layoffs, reopen the warehouses, and secure compensation for employees. The timing of Amazon’s move is suspect, coming less than a year after the successful unionization of its DXT4 warehouse in Laval—the first Amazon facility in Canada to achieve this milestone. Amazon insists the closures are part of a “strategic shift” aimed at optimizing its North American delivery model. However, labor advocates see it differently, arguing that the timing suggests retaliation rather than efficiency. An Amazon spokesperson stated, “Our goal is to align operations with evolving market demands,” but did not directly address concerns about union-busting. Amazon has indicated a willingness to discuss the matter with Canadian and Quebec officials but has not signaled any intention to reverse its decision. This lack of transparency is fueling skepticism, particularly among workers who see a pattern reminiscent of past corporate tactics. CSN president Caroline Senneville didn’t mince words in a press conference, calling out Amazon’s reasoning as a smokescreen: They’re not fooling anyone. The only reason for Amazon to have a different business model just for Quebec is that there’s a union here and an arbitrator could have imposed a first collective agreement as early as the summer of 2025.” If this sounds familiar, it’s because it is. In 2005, Walmart shut down a store in Jonquière, Quebec, shortly after workers unionized—a move the courts later ruled was a violation of labor law. Now, history appears to be repeating itself, only this time, Amazon is the corporate heavyweight on the defensive. Beyond the immediate labor dispute, Amazon’s decision has ignited broader political and economic tensions. Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne has suggested that the federal government could reevaluate its business relationship with Amazon, including contracts with Amazon Web Services. If that happens, the financial stakes could extend far beyond a few warehouses. Meanwhile, the CSN is upping the ante by urging the public to hit Amazon where it hurts—its bottom line. The union is calling for a boycott, encouraging Canadians to stop shopping on Amazon and cancel their Prime subscriptions. Given the rising anti-American corporate sentiment fueled by U.S.-Canada tensions—most recently exacerbated by President Trump’s tariff threats—this call to action may find a very receptive audience. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a recent press conference, “Canadians are more united than ever.” At its core, this battle isn’t just about one company or even one industry—it’s about the growing friction between corporate behemoths and the workers who fuel their profits. The pandemic solidified Amazon’s dominance, but it also heightened awareness of the often-precarious conditions for its workforce. Unionization efforts, once seen as nearly impossible in Amazon’s high-turnover, high-pressure environment, are gaining momentum. Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos’ latest public appearance only fuels accusations of his corporate opportunism. Once critical of Donald Trump threat to democracy, Bezos was front and center at Trump’s 2025 inauguration, alongside other tech giants like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. His presence signals a stark reversal from his 2016 warnings about “Trump’s authoritarian tendencies” are “eroding our democracy”. Rather than ideological alignment, Bezos’ attendance suggests that his business interests take precedence over past political stances. To be fair, he may have had a genuine change of heart, but for many employees and consumers, his shifting stance only deepens uncertainty about where he truly stands. The outcome of the CSN’s lawsuit remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: This isn’t just a labor dispute—it’s a test case for the power dynamics between multinational corporations, governments, and organized labor in an era of economic turbulence. Amazon may be accustomed to controlling the narrative, but in Quebec, the fight is far from over. An avid book reader and proud library card holder, Angela is new to the world of e-Readers.

The timing of Amazon’s move is suspect, coming less than a year after the successful unionization of its DXT4 warehouse in Laval—the first Amazon facility in Canada to achieve this milestone. Amazon insists the closures are part of a “strategic shift” aimed at optimizing its North American delivery model. However, labor advocates see it differently, arguing that the timing suggests retaliation rather than efficiency. An Amazon spokesperson stated, “Our goal is to align operations with evolving market demands,” but did not directly address concerns about union-busting. Amazon has indicated a willingness to discuss the matter with Canadian and Quebec officials but has not signaled any intention to reverse its decision. This lack of transparency is fueling skepticism, particularly among workers who see a pattern reminiscent of past corporate tactics. CSN president Caroline Senneville didn’t mince words in a press conference, calling out Amazon’s reasoning as a smokescreen: They’re not fooling anyone. The only reason for Amazon to have a different business model just for Quebec is that there’s a union here and an arbitrator could have imposed a first collective agreement as early as the summer of 2025.” If this sounds familiar, it’s because it is. In 2005, Walmart shut down a store in Jonquière, Quebec, shortly after workers unionized—a move the courts later ruled was a violation of labor law. Now, history appears to be repeating itself, only this time, Amazon is the corporate heavyweight on the defensive. Beyond the immediate labor dispute, Amazon’s decision has ignited broader political and economic tensions. Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne has suggested that the federal government could reevaluate its business relationship with Amazon, including contracts with Amazon Web Services. If that happens, the financial stakes could extend far beyond a few warehouses. Meanwhile, the CSN is upping the ante by urging the public to hit Amazon where it hurts—its bottom line. The union is calling for a boycott, encouraging Canadians to stop shopping on Amazon and cancel their Prime subscriptions. Given the rising anti-American corporate sentiment fueled by U.S.-Canada tensions—most recently exacerbated by President Trump’s tariff threats—this call to action may find a very receptive audience. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a recent press conference, “Canadians are more united than ever.” At its core, this battle isn’t just about one company or even one industry—it’s about the growing friction between corporate behemoths and the workers who fuel their profits. The pandemic solidified Amazon’s dominance, but it also heightened awareness of the often-precarious conditions for its workforce. Unionization efforts, once seen as nearly impossible in Amazon’s high-turnover, high-pressure environment, are gaining momentum. Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos’ latest public appearance only fuels accusations of his corporate opportunism. Once critical of Donald Trump threat to democracy, Bezos was front and center at Trump’s 2025 inauguration, alongside other tech giants like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. His presence signals a stark reversal from his 2016 warnings about “Trump’s authoritarian tendencies” are “eroding our democracy”. Rather than ideological alignment, Bezos’ attendance suggests that his business interests take precedence over past political stances. To be fair, he may have had a genuine change of heart, but for many employees and consumers, his shifting stance only deepens uncertainty about where he truly stands. The outcome of the CSN’s lawsuit remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: This isn’t just a labor dispute—it’s a test case for the power dynamics between multinational corporations, governments, and organized labor in an era of economic turbulence. Amazon may be accustomed to controlling the narrative, but in Quebec, the fight is far from over. An avid book reader and proud library card holder, Angela is new to the world of e-Readers.

Title: ‘AI may become judge, jury and executioner’ – global risks expert to RT

Time Published: 2025-02-14T18:55:24Z
Full Content:
Last week, Google revised its artificial intelligence principles, removing the company’s stance against using AI to develop weapons or technologies or directly facilitate injury to people, or for surveillance that violates internationally accepted norms. Google’s AI head Demis Hassabis said the guidelines were being overhauled in a changing world and that AI should protect “national security”. RT has interviewed Dr. Mathew Maavak, a senior consultant for Malaysia’s National Artificial Intelligence Roadmap 2021-2025 (AI-Rmap), scholar on global risks, geopolitics, strategic foresight, governance and AI, on the potential consequences of Google’s new policies. RT: Does this mean that Google and other corporations will now start making AI-powered weapons? Dr. Mathew Maavak: First and foremost, Google was largely the creation of the US national security apparatus or simply, the “deep state”.The origins of many, if not all, Big Tech entities today can be traced to ground-breaking research undertaken by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and its predecessor the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). So, the quasi-private entity called Google is inextricably beholden to its “national security” origins, as are other Big Tech entities. Weaponizing AI and creating AI-powered weapons is a natural progression for these entities. Microsoft has long established its own “military empire”. Furthermore, Big Tech platforms have been extensively used for data and intelligence-gathering activities worldwide. This is a reason why China has banned many US Big Tech software and apps. A nation cannot be sovereign if it is beholden to Big Tech! As for Google changing its guidelines on AI, this should not come as a surprise. Big Tech was actively promoting universal AI governance models through various high-profile institutional shills, United Nations agencies, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), think tanks and national governments. Through my recent work in this field, it became abundantly clear that the US government sought to stifle the development of indigenous AI worldwide by promoting half-baked and turgid AI Governance models that are riddled with contradictions. The gap between lofty aspirations and longstanding realities are simply unbridgeable. The same playbook was deployed to push Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) schemes worldwide – imposing heavy costs on developing nations and corporations alike. Now, the US and Big Capital are ditching the very ESG schemes they had devised. Unfortunately, many nations fell for these ploys, investing significant money and resources into building fanciful ESG and AI frameworks. These nations risk becoming permanently dependent on Big Tech under what I call “AI neo-colonialism”. Alphabet’s Google and YouTube, Microsoft’s Bing and Elon Musk’s X have long weaponized their platforms before this recent change in AI policy. Big Tech’s search algorithms have been weaponized to erase dissenters and contrarian platforms from the digital landscape, effectively imposing a modern-day damnatio memoriae.I have to use the Russian search engine Yandex in order to retrieve my old articles. RT: Why is this change being made now? Dr. Mathew Maavak: All weapons systems increasingly rely on AI. The Russia-Ukrainian conflict alone has seen AI being used in the battlefield. The extensive use of drones, with possible swarm intelligence capabilities, is just one out of many anecdotal examples of AI usage in Ukraine. You cannot create next-generation weapons and countermeasures without AI. You cannot bring a knife to a gunfight, as the old saying goes. It must be noted that one of the most profitable and future-proof sectors, with guaranteed returns on investments, is the Military-Industrial Complex. Weaponizing AI and making AI-powered weapons is just a natural course of action for Big Tech. It is also quite telling that the leaders of the two AI superpowers — the United States and China — skipped the recent Paris AI Summit. The event devolved into a scripted talk shop orchestrated by Big Tech. Alongside the United Kingdom, the United States also refused to sign the declaration on making AI “safe for all.” Clearly, this event was staged to suppress AI innovation in developing nations while legitimizing the weaponization of AI by major powers. RT: Google’s ‘principles’, to begin with, are set by Google itself, are voluntary and non-binding under any law. So theoretically nothing was preventing the company from just going ahead with any kind of AI research it wanted. Why did it feel the need to make it “official”? Dr. Mathew Maavak: Google’s so-called “principles” were never determined by the company alone. They were a mere sop for public consumption, perfectly encapsulated by its laughably cynical motto: “Don’t be evil.” Its parent company Alphabet is owned by the usual suspects from Big Capital such as Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street etc. – all of whom are private arms of the US deep state. An entity like Google cannot conduct “any kind of AI research” as its activities have to conform to the diktats of its primary stakeholders. Google formalized its new weaponization policy because the public’s stake in its ownership pie is virtually nonexistent. RT: Is it time to come up with international laws regarding military AI – like Google’s principles before the recent change, but enforceable? Dr. Mathew Maavak: As I have alluded to earlier, various international AI Governance models – all of whom are pretty much a facsimile of each other – were surreptitiously-formulated by the likes of Google, Microsoft, Amazon and other members of the so-called Tech Bros. Nations were just given the illusion of having a stake in this global AI legal and ethics matrix. Bureaucrats merely rubber-stamped whatever Big Tech promoted through various actors and avenues. At the same time, dissenters to this travesty were systematically ostracised. They may however end up having the last laugh in a coming AI-linked SHTF event. (I will save this line of inquiry for another day). There are other vexing issues to consider here: How does one define “AI war crime” within an international legal framework? Is it even possible to come up with a universal consensus? The operator of an armed drone responsible for wiping out scores of civilians might pin the disaster on an AI glitch. The software running the drone itself may have algorithms sourced from various private entities across the world. Who should shoulder the blame in the event of a war crime? The operator, the vendor responsible for software integration or the entity whose algorithm was used or adapted for targeting? Realistically, it should be the antagonist nation but never bet the farm on restitution if the culprit happens to be the United States or a close ally like Israel. Last but not least, governments worldwide acted as co-conspirators in Google’s use of AI to censor dissenting scientific viewpoints and contrarian research findings during the so-called COVID-19 pandemic. In doing so, they have effectively handed Big Tech permanent leverage to blackmail them. Furthermore, what do you think facilitates a welter of bioweapons research across 400-odd US military-linked laboratories worldwide? Gain-of-function microbial experimentation is not possible without AI. RT: AI tools in non-military areas of life, such as generation of texts or images, are still far from perfect. Isn’t it a bit early to rely on them in warfare? Dr. Mathew Maavak: The generation of AI texts and images can absolutely be used for warfare, and this is already becoming a significant concern in modern conflict scenarios. AI-generated content can be weaponized via AI-generated texts (propaganda, disinformation etc); AI-generated images/deepfakes (e.g. to subvert national leaderships/consensus); fake intelligence (e.g.create casus belli) and spoofing communications (e.g. subverting chain of command), among others. The possibilities here are simply endless! AI is evolving at an exponential rate. Yesterday’s science fiction is tomorrow’s reality! RT: As reported recently by the Washington Post, Google appears to have been providing AI tools for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) since the start of their Gaza campaign. Could the change in the company’s AI principles be linked to that? Dr. Mathew Maavak: I highly doubt it. The IDF’s use of Google’s cloud computing services and related tools (Amazon was teased as an alternative) may arguably be portrayed as the canonical starting point for the weaponization of AI. But why would the IDF want a multinational civilian workforce based in the United States to have access to its military operations? If Google provided AI tools to the IDF, it would have done so under directives from the US deep state. A nominally civilian entity cannot unilaterally supply sensitive AI tools for wartime use to any foreign power, allied or otherwise. Logically speaking, Google’s participation in the Gazan carnage should result in a massive boycott by member states of the Organization of Islamic States (OIC). But this will never happen as too many politicians, “technocrats” and academics in the OIC are beholden to US patronage. (The ongoing USAID scandal is just the tip of the iceberg, revealing the extent of international subversion at play). The rail guards of merit, bias and non-discrimination are also virtually non-existent in the OIC bloc, although they form the pillars of AI governance. All in all, AI principles as they currently stand, whether in civilian or military spheres, are nothing more than a paper tiger. RT: Again concerning the IDF, it has beenrevealed that a lot of the civilian deaths in Gaza were apparently not a result of poor AI tools, but of negligent human oversight. Perhaps military AI, when employed properly, could actually lead to more humane warfare? Dr. Mathew Maavak: Honestly, I don’t think AI had played a significant role in the genocidal war in Gaza. The use of AI would have led to a targeted military campaign; not a mad, blood-stained blunderbuss of terror. This was no “oversight”; this was intentional! Compare Israel’s recent actions in Gaza to the relatively-professional military campaign it conducted in the same area in 2014 – when human intelligence (HUMINT) and Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) played a bigger role vis-a-vis AI. Did AI dumb down the IDF or is AI being used as a scapegoat for Israel’s war crimes? The bigger question however is this: Why did the IDF’s AI-coordinated border security system fail to detect Hamas’ military activities in the lead-up to the October 7 2024, cross-border attacks? The system is equipped with multiple sensors and detection tools across land, sea, air, and underground — making the failure even more perplexing. In the final analysis, AI is being weaponized across all facets of human life, including religion, and US Big Tech is leading the way. Ultimately, under certain circumstances in the future, AI may be used to act as the judge, jury and executioner. It may decide who is worthy to live, and who is not. We are indeed living in interesting times. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2025. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

Title: Bezos’ Blue Origin Cuts 10% of Jobs to Ramp Up Rocket Launches

Blue Origin is reportedly planning on letting go of approximately 10% of its workforce—about 1,000 employees—nearly a month after the inaugural liftoff of New Glenn. The company is hoping to focus on growth over the next few years, increasing the production and launch cadence of its new giant rocket. In an email sent to employees on Thursday, Blue Origin CEO David Limp announced the layoffs that will affect “positions in engineering, (research and development), and program/project management and thinning out our layers of management,” according to a copy of the email obtained by CNN. After years of delays, Blue Origin finally debuted its New Glenn rocket on January 16. The heavy-lift launch vehicle blasted off from Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, marking the first time a Blue Origin rocket reached orbit (the company’s New Shepard rocket, used for space tourism purposes, is suborbital). New Glenn’s second stage reached its target orbit following a pair of successful burns of the BE-3U engines, while its booster was lost during descent. The company was hoping to carry out a soft landing of the booster on an ocean-based platform, but alas, that didn’t happen. Still, the rocket’s inaugural flight was a major success. During an all-hands call on Thursday, Limp argued that the company’s decision to let go of more than 1,000 employees would help Blue Origin scale the manufacturing of New Glenn and increase its launch cadence, Reuters reported. The rocket could pose some serious competition for SpaceX, further fueling the rivalry between Blue Origin’s founder Jeff Bezos and SpaceX’s Elon Musk. New Glenn is a partially reusable, heavy-lift rocket capable of lifting 45 metric tons to low Earth orbit and 13 metric tons to geostationary transfer orbit. The 313-foot-tall (95-meter) rocket has a reusable first stage, powered by seven methane-burning BE-4 engines. By comparison, SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy is a partially reusable, heavy-lift rocket capable of carrying 63 metric tons to low Earth orbit and 26 metric tons to geostationary orbit. SpaceX has been an industry favorite for years, while Bezos’ Blue Origin finally got it together last year under new leadership. The company replaced Bob Smith as CEO, hiring former Amazon executive Limp as his replacement. Blue Origin employees, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said that Limp has been tasked with streamlining the company’s business units and pushing for greater focus on New Glenn, providing an overall sense of urgency after years of stagnation. Limp’s push for speed, however, has affected morale and company culture, Blue Origin employees told Reuters. It’s good to see the company making progress on its space ambition, but that, unfortunately, seems to have come at a price. blue originJeff Bezosnew glenn Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: TikTok isn’t out of the woods yet

Employees are on edge about layoffs and a deal still has to happen. Also: Google execs dodge questions, and a tough week inside Meta. Employees are on edge about layoffs and a deal still has to happen. Also: Google execs dodge questions, and a tough week inside Meta. by Alex Heath Happy Valentine’s Day. I’m sending this from the NBA All-Star Technology Summit in San Francisco, where I’ve never seen so many major streaming competitors onstage at once. This week, I go inside TikTok, Google, and Meta. Keep reading for what Elon Musk really wants with his bid for OpenAI… On Wednesday night, ByteDance employees tuned in to their company all-hands meeting with senior leaders from across the company, including TikTok chief Shou Chew. The elephant in the room was, of course, the fate of the app in the United States. During the meeting, Chew said, “We remain confident that we can make a lot of progress to stabilize the situation hopefully soon,” according to a transcript of his remarks I’ve seen. The next day, Apple and Google suddenly returned TikTok to their US app stores after receiving private, written assurance from newly confirmed Attorney General Pam Bondi that they wouldn’t be fined for breaking the law. (Bondi’s letter has yet to be made public, and all parties involved are refusing to comment on it.) During the all-hands meeting, Chew alluded to the years of political miscalculations that led TikTok to this point. “With this road to trust building, if you look back over the years, we actually have made a lot of progress,” said Chew. “Even though the road has been a little bit too steep and windy, we’ve gotten stronger and we’ve survived.” He assured employees that TikTok’s advertising business had stabilized since the brief period when the app was completely offline in the US and that the company is exceeding its user engagement goal. The US is not TikTok’s top market by users or revenue, but it’s by far the most influential. As the weeks went on without the app being in US stores, TikTok’s leaders quietly mounted a pressure campaign around the issue. Key execs, including policy chief Michael Beckerman, held off-the-record Q&A sessions with TikTok creators in recent days to stress that Apple and Google have the legal assurances they need to host the app and not face earth-shattering fines, according to creators who attended the Zoom calls. (Some who attended these closed-door sessions have posted this takeaway publicly.) In these Q&As, TikTok’s representatives acknowledged that the app was suffering from glitches due to some US service providers still not working with the company. “They explained that there was some kind of issue reloading coins, which are used to send creators gifts,” one creator who attended a Q&A session told me. “Live content and coin purchases in-app are affected,” another recalled TikTok’s leaders saying. It’s unclear if these kinds of glitches are fixed now that Apple and Google are hosting the app again. While I’m sure that some TikTok employees are celebrating its return to app stores, the app’s fate is far from certain. President Donald Trump and China still have to work out a deal that could see TikTok become at least partially owned by some kind of US sovereign wealth fund. Trump has made clear that he has the leverage and wants to use TikTok as a bargaining chip with China. In the US, TikTok is not in control of its destiny. Many TikTok employees are also buzzing about the ominous warning Chew gave during the all-hands meeting about future layoffs. “We just have to make sure that the organization is in the right shape at this point in time,” he said, adding that “certain teams” had become “bloated” and “clunky.” “I think we can remove a lot of this overlap of roles and responsibilities,” he continued, “And through that, we can probably offer better job security for everyone because then your work actually has real value and you’re not just part of a meaningless process.” Google’s semi-regular “TGIF” all-hands meetings have been heavily scripted for quite some time. Even still, employees attended this week’s TGIF hoping to better understand why the company is ending its DEI programs and starting to allow its AI to be used for weapons. On the topic of DEI, CEO Sundar Pichai had nothing revelatory to say. “We’ve always deeply cared about hiring the best people around the world and creating opportunities for all,” he said while dialed in from Paris, according to multiple employees who attended the meeting. “Our values are enduring but we have to comply with legal directions depending on how they evolve.” After stressing that Google’s employee resource groups aren’t going away, Melonie Parker, Google’s former head of diversity, who (like her counterpart at Meta) has had her title changed to head of “engagement,” again cited the company’s status as a “federal contractor” as contributing to the changes. She said Google will “depreciate a number of our training programs that are focused on DEI” and update others to remove related language. Google’s top lawyer, Kent Walker, somehow managed to say even less when answering employee questions about the decision to quietly remove the company’s public commitment to keep its AI out of weapons. He said it was good for society for Google to be in the mix on these kinds of government contracts and suggested the company still had red lines for how its technology could be used but didn’t spell them out. It’s not just military applications of AI that Google employees have taken issue with. I’m told that some complained about how Google has been using AI to aggregate and summarize pre-submitted employee questions in these TGIF meetings.

February 14, 2025 13:16 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information.

Title: Novo Nordisk is facing its worst week this year — after that Hims & Hers Super Bowl ad

Novo Nordisk (NVO-1.22%) stock took a hit this week, after a Super Bowl ad highlighted a growing challenge to the company’s dominance over the weight-loss industry. The Danish pharma giant, known for its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss medications Ozempic and Wegovy, is on track to have its worst week on Wall Street this year. Novo Nordisk shares have tumbled more than 9%, following an ad during the Super Bowl from the millennial-focused telehealth company Hims & Hers (HIMS+2.18%), which promoted its off-brand Ozempic. The controversial ad took a surprisingly political tone — with Donald Glover’s “This Is America” as its soundtrack — criticizing the high price tag of branded weight-loss drugs. “Welcome to weight loss in America — a $160 billion industry that feeds on our failure,” said a narrator in the commercial. “There are medications that work — but they are priced for profits, not patients.” The ad briefly featured the company’s GLP-1 injections. The weekly treatment contains compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy. In May, Hims & Hers started offering compounded semaglutide injections for just $199 a month — hundreds of dollars cheaper than Ozempic’s nearly $1,000 list price and Wegovy’s $1,349 price tag. GLP-1 drugs are a class of medications that mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite. However, due to their high retail price, U.S. patent protections, and skyrocketing demand, many patients have had difficulty getting their hands on these popular medications. When a medication is in shortage, which Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy has been for years, the FDA allows pharmacies to make compounded or altered versions of the drug if they meet specific regulatory requirements. This loophole has led several digital health companies, online pharmacies, and wellness spas to produce and sell cheaper versions of brand-name weight-loss drugs. Novo Nordisk’s executive vice president of U.S. operations, David Moore, told investors on a call last week that the compounded market is having an impact on the company’s demand, and that impact is “growing faster” than anticipated. Novo Nordisk reported, this month, that full-year sales of all its drugs grew 26% to $40.5 billion. However, the company projects that sales growth in 2025 will slow down to between 16% and 24%. Both Novo Nordisk, and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY-3.00%), have been ramping up production of their GLP-1 medications to remove them from the FDA’s drug shortage list, a goal Eli Lilly achieved late last year. The pharmaceutical giants have also filed petitions with the FDA to have their medications added to a list of drugs deemed too complex to compound safely. Novo Nordisk even took out a newspaper ad this week warning of the risks of taking copycat drugs. This isn’t Novo Nordisk’s only recent setback. In December, the company’s experimental diabetes and weight-loss drug, CagriSema — touted as a potential successor to Ozempic — fell short of expectations. The drug failed to hit the projected 25% average weight loss anticipated by analysts and the company, with patients in a phase 3 trial shedding an average of 22.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks. The disappointment sent Novo’s stock plunging 20% in a single day. The company’s shares are now down more than 34% over the past year, and it has lost its crown as Europe’s most valuable company to luxury conglamorate LVMH (MC+0.25%). Meanwhile, Hims & Hers has seen its stock skyrocket nearly 500% in the past year. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

February 14, 2025 12:57 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Wisconsin’s investment board saw fit to significantly add to its bitcoin (BTC) bet in the last three months of the year. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) disclosed ownership of just over 6 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as of the Dec. 31, per a 13F filing on Friday, up from roughly 2.9 million shares three months prior. The position is valued at $340 million at IBIT's current price of $56.10 and would be worth about $588 million at bitcoin's current price near $98,000. The fund in 2024 became the first of its kind to report a bitcoin ETF purchase, initially buying 94,562 shares of IBIT and some shares of Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which it later sold. The State of Michigan Retirement System later also reported owning shares of bitcoin ETFs, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and two of Grayscale's bitcoin products. SWIB, established in 1951, oversees more than $156 billion in assets including funds from the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) and the State Investment Fund (SIF). The board manages investments on behalf of state employees and other trust funds. Today marks the deadline for institutional investors managing at least $100 million in assets to report quarterly holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The market is closely monitoring these filings to gauge whether large traditional finance firms have been adding bitcoin ETFs to their portfolios since their launch last year. UPDATE (Feb. 14, 18:49 UTC): Updates current valuation of State of Wisconsin's stake in IBIT.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us DeepSeek has gone viral. Chinese AI lab DeepSeek broke into the mainstream consciousness this week after its chatbot app rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts (and Google Play, as well). DeepSeek’s AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques, have led Wall Street analysts — and technologists — to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain. But where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly? DeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions. AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng co-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms. In 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek. From day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China, DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies. DeepSeek’s technical team is said to skew young. The company reportedly aggressively recruits doctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities. DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science background to help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times. DeepSeek unveiled its first set of models — DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat — in November 2023. But it wasn’t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice. DeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks — and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek’s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free. DeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek’s notoriety. According to DeepSeek’s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta’s Llama and “closed” models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI’s GPT-4o. Equally impressive is DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model. Released in January, DeepSeek claims R1 performs as well as OpenAI’s o1 model on key benchmarks. Being a reasoning model, R1 effectively fact-checks itself, which helps it to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. Reasoning models take a little longer — usually seconds to minutes longer — to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside is that they tend to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and math. There is a downside to R1, DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek’s other models, however. Being Chinese-developed AI, they’re subject to benchmarking by China’s internet regulator to ensure that its responses “embody core socialist values.” In DeepSeek’s chatbot app, for example, R1 won’t answer questions about Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy. If DeepSeek has a business model, it’s not clear what that model is, exactly. The company prices its products and services well below market value — and gives others away for free. The way DeepSeek tells it, efficiency breakthroughs have enabled it to maintain extreme cost competitiveness. Some experts dispute the figures the company has supplied, however. Whatever the case may be, developers have taken to DeepSeek’s models, which aren’t open source as the phrase is commonly understood but are available under permissive licenses that allow for commercial use. According to Clem Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, one of the platforms hosting DeepSeek’s models, developers on Hugging Face have created over 500 “derivative” models of R1 that have racked up 2.5 million downloads combined. DeepSeek’s success against larger and more established rivals has been described as “upending AI” and “over-hyped.” The company’s success was at least in part responsible for causing Nvidia’s stock price to drop by 18% on Monday, and for eliciting a public response from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Microsoft announced that DeepSeek is available on its Azure AI Foundry service, Microsoft’s platform that brings together AI services for enterprises under a single banner. When asked about DeepSeek’s impact on Meta’s AI spending during its first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said spending on AI infrastructure will continue to be a “strategic advantage” for Meta. At the same time, some companies are banning DeepSeek, and so are entire countries and governments. New York state also banned DeepSeek from being used on government devices. As for what DeepSeek’s future might hold, it’s not clear. Improved models are a given. But the U.S. government appears to be growing wary of what it perceives as harmful foreign influence.

Title: Meta Shakes Off TikTok Return, Heads for 20th Straight Day of Wall Street Gains

Time Published: 2025-02-14T17:25:22Z
Full Content:
Mark Zuckerberg’s company has seen a 31% surge since the election Even TikTok’s return could not spoil Meta’s long-running party on Wall Street, with the company behind Facebook and Instagram heading towards its 20th straight day of gains on Friday. That easily laps Meta’s previous record of 11 straight days of gains, set back in 2015. Mark Zuckerberg’s company, during early trading on Friday, was up about 8 points, or 1.1% — nothing major, but it would still count as another positive day if those gains hold through the closing bell. TikTok, of course, is one of Meta’s chief competitors, so its return to the Apple and Google app stores on Thursday evening could have potentially spooked Meta investors on Friday morning. And as TheWrap reported this week, TikTok laps Facebook and YouTube when it comes to how much time the average American user spends on the app each day. Still, Meta investors do not appear to be too concerned. Meta has been on a hot streak since Election Day, with its share price increasing 31% to $737.45 per share since then. (The company was seeing a strong 2024 heading into the election as well, it’s worth pointing out.) Those recent gains have pushed Meta to a valuation of $1.86 trillion — making it the sixth most-valuable public company in the world. Zuckerberg, who once kicked Donald Trump off of his platforms, has had a cozier relationship with the president in recent months. He was spotted alongside Tesla boss Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, among other tech executives, at Trump’s inauguration last month — but many MAGA fans told TheWrap they were skeptical of Zuckerberg’s sudden friendship with the president.

Title: Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin to Cut 10% of Workforce to Compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX

Time Published: 2025-02-14T17:00:06Z
Full Content:
Blue Origin, the rocket company founded by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, has announced plans to lay off 10 percent of its employees to streamline operations and improve its competitive position against Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The Seattle Times reports that Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp informed employees of the impending layoffs via email, citing the need to reduce bureaucracy and sharpen the company’s focus. The 10 percent cut, which will impact over 1,000 workers across engineering, research and development, and management roles, are part of a broader strategy to scale up manufacturing output and launch frequency. The announcement caught many employees off guard, with some expressing concerns about the loss of institutional knowledge and the ability to meet ambitious goals with a reduced workforce. Blue Origin, which employs between 11,000 and 14,000 people, including more than 4,000 in Washington state, did not provide a breakdown of how the layoffs would affect its various locations. The move comes on the heels of the successful launch of Blue Origin’s New Glenn orbital rocket, a milestone that was seen as a step forward in the company’s efforts to catch up with Elon Musk’s SpaceX. However, the company has faced criticism for its slow pace of progress and bloated structure under previous leadership. Limp, who joined Blue Origin in 2023 after leading Amazon’s devices and services division, has sought to bring a more Amazon-like approach to the company, emphasizing efficiency and rapid growth. This shift in culture has been seen as a departure from the “slow and steady” philosophy embodied by the company’s tortoise mascot and Latin motto, “gradatim ferociter” (step by step, ferociously). Despite the layoffs, Limp expressed optimism about Blue Origin’s future, outlining an ambitious agenda for 2025 that includes landing on the Moon, delivering a record number of engines, and establishing a regular launch cadence for its New Glenn and New Shepard rockets. He also noted that the company would continue to hire in areas that support its goals and customer focus. The layoffs at Blue Origin reflect a broader trend in the aerospace industry, as companies grapple with the challenges of scaling up production and achieving profitability in an increasingly competitive market.

NEW YORK, Feb. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lowey Dannenberg P.C., a preeminent law firm in obtaining redress for consumers and investors, announces the filing of a class action lawsuit against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) for violations of the federal securities laws on behalf of investors who purchased or acquired Novo common stock between November 2, 2022 to December 19, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). On January 24, 2025, a complaint was filed against the Company and certain of its officers, alleging that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo’s projected successful outcome of Novo’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (ii) Novo’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (iii) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo sought to demonstrate.

Title: Will Markets Go Up Now That Trump Is President?

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/14/2025 8:30:11 AM PST by SeekAndFind Donald Trump was the first president in modern U.S. history to take office without holding a prior public office or serving in the military. This non-traditional path to the White House came with a distinctly corporate approach to economic and fiscal policy, one that both excited and unnerved investors in equal measure.Key PointsTrump’s focus on tax cuts, deregulation, and tariffs boosted domestic industries but disrupted global trade, benefiting sectors like energy, infrastructure, and defense.Rising national debt and aggressive fiscal policies under Trump could fuel short-term market gains but increase long-term risks and volatility.Trump’s pivot toward crypto and rapid-fire policy changes could create opportunities in digital assets and industries favored by his administration.A Business-Oriented White HouseFrom the moment he entered the political arena, Donald Trump presented himself as a businessman whose background in real estate and media would translate into a savvy dealmaking approach in Washington. During his first presidency (2017–2021), that style permeated discussions on tax reform, international trade, and budget negotiations.Trump’s administration sought to pair substantial corporate tax cuts with extensive deregulation to stimulate economic growth. These policies were credited by some for boosting corporate earnings, although detractors questioned whether they would deliver long-term, sustainable gains.Investors observing a potential second Trump presidency, or even the memory of the first, note the lasting influence of Trump’s worldview on business and trade.The belief that renegotiating trade deals and encouraging domestic manufacturing could strengthen the U.S. economy shaped Trump’s policies. For instance, the 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum briefly boosted certain domestic industries but also invited retaliatory tariffs from major trade partners, complicating global supply chains.Future implementations or expansions of such policies under a renewed Trump mandate could create opportunities in industries he deems “strategic,” particularly manufacturing, steel, aluminum, and energy.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, exports of goods and services from the United States reached nearly $2.5 trillion by 2019, but tariff adjustments under the Trump administration reshuffled major trade partnerships.During the late 2010s, manufacturing employment rose by approximately 500,000 jobs according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, partly attributed to Trump’s emphasis on domestic production. Investors who tracked these shifts found that industrial and materials sector ETFs saw fluctuating inflows during the period as markets adjusted to tariff policies.US Debt Levels and Fiscal PrioritiesOne of the least discussed topics during election season was the impact of US debt. When Trump first took office in January 2017, the national debt stood around $19.9 trillion. By the time he left in January 2021, that figure had ballooned to nearly $27 trillion and today it sits at $36 trillion.Part of this rise was fueled by 2020-21 era stimulus, but it also stemmed from tax cuts and mushrooming federal spending. Few would argue that the pace of borrowing is untenable, but supporters counter that the administration’s pro-growth policies will help offset deficits in the long run through higher GDP.A renewed Trump presidency may double down on this growth-oriented approach, potentially implementing additional tax cuts or infrastructure spending to stimulate economic activity. There is also a lot of talk of an External Revenue Service that tariffs other nations to drum up capital versus an Internal Revenue Service to tax those living within US borders.In the short term, these measures may boost investor confidence but the long-term cost of servicing higher debt may shape future policy choices, potentially leading to debates on entitlement reform or cuts to federal programs. The tangled web connecting rising debt and interest rates is likely to become more pressing, especially if investors demand higher yields on U.S. Treasuries, as some like Cem Karsan are forecasting by year-end.Federal Reserve Policy & Inflation PressuresThe President has theoretically no oversight or control over monetary policy but in the last Presidential cycle, Trump was famously outspoken about the Fed’s decisions and often urged lower interest rates to spur economic growth.A second Trump presidency is likely to renew that pressure and will probably create tension if inflation persists and the Fed seeks to tighten policy. The Fed is between a rock and a hard place in this regard, because lower interest rates are only going to exacerbate a future decline and already the long-end of the curve is signaling that it disagrees with lower rate policy.Inflation is also a genie that might be out of the box, not least due to increased government spending so if the Fed is forced to raise rates in response, both corporate and consumer borrowing are likely to slow. Stocks as a whole and in particular growth stocks are most likely to feel the brunt of these Fed actions.During Trump’s last tenure, the federal funds rate ranged from near-zero to 2.5%, and peaked in late 2018 according to Federal Reserve data. If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed from roughly 19,800 at Trump’s 2017 inauguration to over 29,000 by early 2020.If the last merri-go-round is a good benchmark for what’s to come, expect the Trump presidency to be accompanied by sharp policy announcements, whether that’s in the form of tariff threats on social media to sudden changes in stance on international alliances.The volatility on the horizon is precisely what short-term traders can capitalize upon, however long-term investors need to stay focused more on policies that move the needle over time, such as corporate tax cuts or infrastructure bills.Cyclical industries, like energy, financials, and industrials, are more likely to benefit from tax and regulatory rollbacks under Trump. Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats. U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players. Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve. Each policy decision is likely to spark investment opportunities for investors who pay close attention to changing market currents.Whether you choose to embrace the volatility, hedge against it, or simply observe from the sidelines, expect a Trump presidency to leave a distinct mark on the investing world and ripple through all sectors from defense to crypto and beyond. Donald Trump was the first president in modern U.S. history to take office without holding a prior public office or serving in the military. This non-traditional path to the White House came with a distinctly corporate approach to economic and fiscal policy, one that both excited and unnerved investors in equal measure.Key PointsTrump’s focus on tax cuts, deregulation, and tariffs boosted domestic industries but disrupted global trade, benefiting sectors like energy, infrastructure, and defense.Rising national debt and aggressive fiscal policies under Trump could fuel short-term market gains but increase long-term risks and volatility.Trump’s pivot toward crypto and rapid-fire policy changes could create opportunities in digital assets and industries favored by his administration.A Business-Oriented White HouseFrom the moment he entered the political arena, Donald Trump presented himself as a businessman whose background in real estate and media would translate into a savvy dealmaking approach in Washington. During his first presidency (2017–2021), that style permeated discussions on tax reform, international trade, and budget negotiations.Trump’s administration sought to pair substantial corporate tax cuts with extensive deregulation to stimulate economic growth. These policies were credited by some for boosting corporate earnings, although detractors questioned whether they would deliver long-term, sustainable gains.Investors observing a potential second Trump presidency, or even the memory of the first, note the lasting influence of Trump’s worldview on business and trade.The belief that renegotiating trade deals and encouraging domestic manufacturing could strengthen the U.S. economy shaped Trump’s policies. For instance, the 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum briefly boosted certain domestic industries but also invited retaliatory tariffs from major trade partners, complicating global supply chains.Future implementations or expansions of such policies under a renewed Trump mandate could create opportunities in industries he deems “strategic,” particularly manufacturing, steel, aluminum, and energy.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, exports of goods and services from the United States reached nearly $2.5 trillion by 2019, but tariff adjustments under the Trump administration reshuffled major trade partnerships.During the late 2010s, manufacturing employment rose by approximately 500,000 jobs according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, partly attributed to Trump’s emphasis on domestic production. Investors who tracked these shifts found that industrial and materials sector ETFs saw fluctuating inflows during the period as markets adjusted to tariff policies.US Debt Levels and Fiscal PrioritiesOne of the least discussed topics during election season was the impact of US debt. When Trump first took office in January 2017, the national debt stood around $19.9 trillion. By the time he left in January 2021, that figure had ballooned to nearly $27 trillion and today it sits at $36 trillion.Part of this rise was fueled by 2020-21 era stimulus, but it also stemmed from tax cuts and mushrooming federal spending. Few would argue that the pace of borrowing is untenable, but supporters counter that the administration’s pro-growth policies will help offset deficits in the long run through higher GDP.A renewed Trump presidency may double down on this growth-oriented approach, potentially implementing additional tax cuts or infrastructure spending to stimulate economic activity. There is also a lot of talk of an External Revenue Service that tariffs other nations to drum up capital versus an Internal Revenue Service to tax those living within US borders.In the short term, these measures may boost investor confidence but the long-term cost of servicing higher debt may shape future policy choices, potentially leading to debates on entitlement reform or cuts to federal programs. The tangled web connecting rising debt and interest rates is likely to become more pressing, especially if investors demand higher yields on U.S. Treasuries, as some like Cem Karsan are forecasting by year-end.Federal Reserve Policy & Inflation PressuresThe President has theoretically no oversight or control over monetary policy but in the last Presidential cycle, Trump was famously outspoken about the Fed’s decisions and often urged lower interest rates to spur economic growth.A second Trump presidency is likely to renew that pressure and will probably create tension if inflation persists and the Fed seeks to tighten policy. The Fed is between a rock and a hard place in this regard, because lower interest rates are only going to exacerbate a future decline and already the long-end of the curve is signaling that it disagrees with lower rate policy.Inflation is also a genie that might be out of the box, not least due to increased government spending so if the Fed is forced to raise rates in response, both corporate and consumer borrowing are likely to slow. Stocks as a whole and in particular growth stocks are most likely to feel the brunt of these Fed actions.During Trump’s last tenure, the federal funds rate ranged from near-zero to 2.5%, and peaked in late 2018 according to Federal Reserve data. If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed from roughly 19,800 at Trump’s 2017 inauguration to over 29,000 by early 2020.If the last merri-go-round is a good benchmark for what’s to come, expect the Trump presidency to be accompanied by sharp policy announcements, whether that’s in the form of tariff threats on social media to sudden changes in stance on international alliances.The volatility on the horizon is precisely what short-term traders can capitalize upon, however long-term investors need to stay focused more on policies that move the needle over time, such as corporate tax cuts or infrastructure bills.Cyclical industries, like energy, financials, and industrials, are more likely to benefit from tax and regulatory rollbacks under Trump. Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats.

Stocks as a whole and in particular growth stocks are most likely to feel the brunt of these Fed actions.During Trump’s last tenure, the federal funds rate ranged from near-zero to 2.5%, and peaked in late 2018 according to Federal Reserve data. If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed from roughly 19,800 at Trump’s 2017 inauguration to over 29,000 by early 2020.If the last merri-go-round is a good benchmark for what’s to come, expect the Trump presidency to be accompanied by sharp policy announcements, whether that’s in the form of tariff threats on social media to sudden changes in stance on international alliances.The volatility on the horizon is precisely what short-term traders can capitalize upon, however long-term investors need to stay focused more on policies that move the needle over time, such as corporate tax cuts or infrastructure bills.Cyclical industries, like energy, financials, and industrials, are more likely to benefit from tax and regulatory rollbacks under Trump. Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats. U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players. Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve. Each policy decision is likely to spark investment opportunities for investors who pay close attention to changing market currents.Whether you choose to embrace the volatility, hedge against it, or simply observe from the sidelines, expect a Trump presidency to leave a distinct mark on the investing world and ripple through all sectors from defense to crypto and beyond. Investors observing a potential second Trump presidency, or even the memory of the first, note the lasting influence of Trump’s worldview on business and trade.The belief that renegotiating trade deals and encouraging domestic manufacturing could strengthen the U.S. economy shaped Trump’s policies. For instance, the 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum briefly boosted certain domestic industries but also invited retaliatory tariffs from major trade partners, complicating global supply chains.Future implementations or expansions of such policies under a renewed Trump mandate could create opportunities in industries he deems “strategic,” particularly manufacturing, steel, aluminum, and energy.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, exports of goods and services from the United States reached nearly $2.5 trillion by 2019, but tariff adjustments under the Trump administration reshuffled major trade partnerships.During the late 2010s, manufacturing employment rose by approximately 500,000 jobs according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, partly attributed to Trump’s emphasis on domestic production. Investors who tracked these shifts found that industrial and materials sector ETFs saw fluctuating inflows during the period as markets adjusted to tariff policies.US Debt Levels and Fiscal PrioritiesOne of the least discussed topics during election season was the impact of US debt. When Trump first took office in January 2017, the national debt stood around $19.9 trillion. By the time he left in January 2021, that figure had ballooned to nearly $27 trillion and today it sits at $36 trillion.Part of this rise was fueled by 2020-21 era stimulus, but it also stemmed from tax cuts and mushrooming federal spending. Few would argue that the pace of borrowing is untenable, but supporters counter that the administration’s pro-growth policies will help offset deficits in the long run through higher GDP.A renewed Trump presidency may double down on this growth-oriented approach, potentially implementing additional tax cuts or infrastructure spending to stimulate economic activity. There is also a lot of talk of an External Revenue Service that tariffs other nations to drum up capital versus an Internal Revenue Service to tax those living within US borders.In the short term, these measures may boost investor confidence but the long-term cost of servicing higher debt may shape future policy choices, potentially leading to debates on entitlement reform or cuts to federal programs.

If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed from roughly 19,800 at Trump’s 2017 inauguration to over 29,000 by early 2020.If the last merri-go-round is a good benchmark for what’s to come, expect the Trump presidency to be accompanied by sharp policy announcements, whether that’s in the form of tariff threats on social media to sudden changes in stance on international alliances.The volatility on the horizon is precisely what short-term traders can capitalize upon, however long-term investors need to stay focused more on policies that move the needle over time, such as corporate tax cuts or infrastructure bills.Cyclical industries, like energy, financials, and industrials, are more likely to benefit from tax and regulatory rollbacks under Trump. Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats. U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players. Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve. Each policy decision is likely to spark investment opportunities for investors who pay close attention to changing market currents.Whether you choose to embrace the volatility, hedge against it, or simply observe from the sidelines, expect a Trump presidency to leave a distinct mark on the investing world and ripple through all sectors from defense to crypto and beyond. During the late 2010s, manufacturing employment rose by approximately 500,000 jobs according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, partly attributed to Trump’s emphasis on domestic production. Investors who tracked these shifts found that industrial and materials sector ETFs saw fluctuating inflows during the period as markets adjusted to tariff policies.US Debt Levels and Fiscal PrioritiesOne of the least discussed topics during election season was the impact of US debt. When Trump first took office in January 2017, the national debt stood around $19.9 trillion. By the time he left in January 2021, that figure had ballooned to nearly $27 trillion and today it sits at $36 trillion.Part of this rise was fueled by 2020-21 era stimulus, but it also stemmed from tax cuts and mushrooming federal spending. Few would argue that the pace of borrowing is untenable, but supporters counter that the administration’s pro-growth policies will help offset deficits in the long run through higher GDP.A renewed Trump presidency may double down on this growth-oriented approach, potentially implementing additional tax cuts or infrastructure spending to stimulate economic activity. There is also a lot of talk of an External Revenue Service that tariffs other nations to drum up capital versus an Internal Revenue Service to tax those living within US borders.In the short term, these measures may boost investor confidence but the long-term cost of servicing higher debt may shape future policy choices, potentially leading to debates on entitlement reform or cuts to federal programs. The tangled web connecting rising debt and interest rates is likely to become more pressing, especially if investors demand higher yields on U.S. Treasuries, as some like Cem Karsan are forecasting by year-end.Federal Reserve Policy & Inflation PressuresThe President has theoretically no oversight or control over monetary policy but in the last Presidential cycle, Trump was famously outspoken about the Fed’s decisions and often urged lower interest rates to spur economic growth.A second Trump presidency is likely to renew that pressure and will probably create tension if inflation persists and the Fed seeks to tighten policy. The Fed is between a rock and a hard place in this regard, because lower interest rates are only going to exacerbate a future decline and already the long-end of the curve is signaling that it disagrees with lower rate policy.Inflation is also a genie that might be out of the box, not least due to increased government spending so if the Fed is forced to raise rates in response, both corporate and consumer borrowing are likely to slow.

Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve. Each policy decision is likely to spark investment opportunities for investors who pay close attention to changing market currents.Whether you choose to embrace the volatility, hedge against it, or simply observe from the sidelines, expect a Trump presidency to leave a distinct mark on the investing world and ripple through all sectors from defense to crypto and beyond. In the short term, these measures may boost investor confidence but the long-term cost of servicing higher debt may shape future policy choices, potentially leading to debates on entitlement reform or cuts to federal programs. The tangled web connecting rising debt and interest rates is likely to become more pressing, especially if investors demand higher yields on U.S. Treasuries, as some like Cem Karsan are forecasting by year-end.Federal Reserve Policy & Inflation PressuresThe President has theoretically no oversight or control over monetary policy but in the last Presidential cycle, Trump was famously outspoken about the Fed’s decisions and often urged lower interest rates to spur economic growth.A second Trump presidency is likely to renew that pressure and will probably create tension if inflation persists and the Fed seeks to tighten policy. The Fed is between a rock and a hard place in this regard, because lower interest rates are only going to exacerbate a future decline and already the long-end of the curve is signaling that it disagrees with lower rate policy.Inflation is also a genie that might be out of the box, not least due to increased government spending so if the Fed is forced to raise rates in response, both corporate and consumer borrowing are likely to slow. Stocks as a whole and in particular growth stocks are most likely to feel the brunt of these Fed actions.During Trump’s last tenure, the federal funds rate ranged from near-zero to 2.5%, and peaked in late 2018 according to Federal Reserve data. If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed from roughly 19,800 at Trump’s 2017 inauguration to over 29,000 by early 2020.If the last merri-go-round is a good benchmark for what’s to come, expect the Trump presidency to be accompanied by sharp policy announcements, whether that’s in the form of tariff threats on social media to sudden changes in stance on international alliances.The volatility on the horizon is precisely what short-term traders can capitalize upon, however long-term investors need to stay focused more on policies that move the needle over time, such as corporate tax cuts or infrastructure bills.Cyclical industries, like energy, financials, and industrials, are more likely to benefit from tax and regulatory rollbacks under Trump. Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats.

For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats. U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players. Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve. Each policy decision is likely to spark investment opportunities for investors who pay close attention to changing market currents.Whether you choose to embrace the volatility, hedge against it, or simply observe from the sidelines, expect a Trump presidency to leave a distinct mark on the investing world and ripple through all sectors from defense to crypto and beyond.

When Reagan got elected, we entered a recession—as it took some time to get inflation down and the economy growing. After a few years, when his policies took the stock market and the economy boomed. But in 1987, there was a short market crash that no one could really explain. Sometimes groupthink in the markets make no sense. Sometimes groupthink in the markets make no sense. ....policies took effect... But in 1987, there was a short market crash that no one could really explain. ************* I still can’t explain the 1987 crash. The market is historically very expensive now based on PE’s (lagging and forward) so it will take some time for earnings to catch up. It will certainly take some time for Trump’s policies to take hold. I’ve predicted the market will crash, and the media pundits will blame that on Trump and his policies, such as tariffs. *********************** Wall Street will try to blame tariffs, but their support of sanctions because of the Russia Ukraine War, were far more damaging to trade & the international economy. The Federal government collected $77 billion in tariffs in 2024, they might collect $90 billion in 2025. “Big Whoop.” Perhaps the left-wing loonies in the financial sector were hoping to crash the economy to sabotage Reagan; just like they are trying to do with Trump. Food prices are rising every week. Restaurants are even adding a surcharge for each egg ordered. Expect the North Virginia real estate market to take a hit. With 75,000 federal employees accepting a buy out, there could be an unusually large number of homes hitting the market in a fairly short time-frame. Yes there isn’t anywhere else to go. Lots of money chasing overvalued assets RE: Food prices are rising every week. Restaurants are even adding a surcharge for each egg ordered. So, what does that do for the Stock market? No idea. I was just calling attention to some economic data. The S&P went up 100% over the last 4 years. No it didn’t. The markets have been going up for the past 4 years. I guess they can keep going up. Gold is taking a major hit today! My poor portfolio! It’s not feelin’ the love this Valentine’s Day. Kemp and Reagan reluctantly accepted a compromise deal on the tax cuts, phasing them in over 3 years. This was a huge mistake, because businesses held off major capital transactions and investments until the final phase of the cut was in effect. Instead of a supply side stimulus, the economy ground to a halt for three years. Below is a piece of interesting trivia I’m putting here since it is economy-related: “In the 25 days since Trump’s inauguration, CNN has mentioned “egg prices” 45 times. But in the 25 days before the inauguration, CNN NEVER mentioned “egg prices.” Over on MSNBC, in the 25 days since Trump’s inauguration, they mentioned “egg prices” 80 times. But in the 25 days before the inauguration, MSNBC mentioned “egg prices” just 1 time.” They are absolutely SHAMELESS! When the Trump tax cuts are extended in the near future, they need to be made PERMANENT this time!

Johnny O’Sullivan’s double was decisive as defending champions Blackrock College marched into the Leinster Schools Senior Cup semi-final at Energia Park on Friday afternoon with a comfortable win over St Michael’s in a repeat of last year’s decider. Despite the greasy ball, these schools looked to go wide early, trading crossfield kicks and the ambition to play at speed. Rock exposed space on the right, the feet of James Browne doing the trick and clean passing put Paddy Clancy on the ball, but his grubber just eluding the reach of Rhys Keogh. Blackrock narrowed their focus to go through the middle, with tighthead Sam Bishti showing surprising speed to test out St Michael’s centre Charlie McConnell. A knock-on was gratefully accepted by St Michael’s and their maul took them out of trouble and into enemy territory. Bernard White’s drive took him over the top of Cathal Lydon’s tackle where Owen Twomey’s groundwork enabled Ethan Black to strike the lead penalty in the 19th minute. Rock’s decision to keep the ball worked wonderfully, replacement Aiden Vetjens’s late line unlocking the defence to send Johnny O’Sullivan into the right corner for a 5-3 lead in the 19th minute. In a flash, sweet passing put Browne clear down the right where St Michael’s captain Duinn Maguire and Dan Ryan shunted the wing into touch. When the decision was taken to go wide, fullback Ryan was in place to intercept in another example of St Michael’s survival to the half-time whistle. . A sustained St Michael’s attack winkled out a penalty for Black to guarantee a 6-5 edge in the 39th minute, but they strayed offside to offer Paddy Clancy a shot at goal to make 8-6 in Rock’s favour in the 43rd minute. Blackrock struck for their second try after centre White’s hard line exploited a gap at the tail of the lineout. Clancy’s lob was then collected by Vetjens for the try, brilliantly converted by Clancy. Then, Clancy’s delicate ball over the top was collected by Joe Reddan and moved to White for the third try, converted by Clancy to make it 22-6 in the 57th minute. St Michael’s centre Black saw a pass slip forward for White to grab the intercept and Johnny O’Sullivan controlled the ball to speed away to the posts for his second try, which Clancy converted to put the game away. St Michael’s were quick to show character late on, implementing a maul strategy for Cian Walsh to drive over, with Black converting. SCORERS – Blackrock: J O’Sullivan 2 tries; A Vetjens, B White try each; P Clancy pen, 3 cons. St Michael’s: C Walsh try; E Black 2 pens, con.

Title: Elon Musk aims to remake the federal government by breaking it

UPDATED 11:12 EST / FEBRUARY 14 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof This week, it was all Elon, all the time. Let’s see: Musk offers to buy OpenAI (translation: gums up the works for Sam Altman’s attempt to turn OpenAI for-profit, since OpenAI’s board Friday rejected the offer). Makes Trump look like a babysitter for Musk’s four-year-old son prop at a press conference. Tries to cement his government coup via DOGE as judges remind him and Trump we’re (supposed to be) a democracy. Creates a cybersecurity nightmare in the process. Gets a $400 million federal bailout for his failed Cybertruck (for a few seconds). Did I miss anything? It’s now “Do whatever you want” with AI, for better or worse, at least in the U.S., as Biden’s AI rules got nixed and the U.S. refused to sign an international agreement on safe and inclusive AI. Meantime, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman pledges more openness (we’ll see), and news organizations get more aggressive on copyright in a lawsuit against Cohere and note continuing problems with hallucinations. Paul Gillin dug into how venture capitalists view the AI investment environment post-DeepSeek, and guess what? It actually looks way more promising than some doomsayers suggested. AI chips are getting very hot. As OpenAI steamrolls ahead on new models, it’s also close to making AI chip in-house. And Arm is now reportedly looking at designing chips to sell itself, with Meta Platforms the likely first customer. Meanwhile, Intel stock rose more than 20% this week after U.S. pushed TSMC to operate its factories, but it’s far from a done deal. Hardware’s not dead, as HPE, Cisco and Juniper release new gear. Dell also could sell $5 billion worth of AI servers to Musk’s xAI. Oh, and Meta reportedly is about to go deep into robotics. Another big earnings week: Cisco, Supermicro, Confluent, Coinbase and Robinhood beat. Informatica sure didn’t, and its stock fell by a third. Palo Alto Networks fell on a disappointing outlook too. Overall it was a mixed bag — full results below. More cyber consolidation is coming, with Trend Micro on the block and CyberArk acquiring Zilla. You can hear more about this and other news on John Furrier’s and Dave Vellante’s weekly podcast theCUBE Pod, out later today on YouTube. And don’t miss Dave’s weekly deep dive, Breaking Analysis, out early next week. Here’s all the news we could fit from SiliconANGLE and beyond, in another busy week: Venture investors see DeepSeek accelerating AI market growth Consortium led by Elon Musk makes $97.4B offer for OpenAI Late-breaking Friday: OpenAI’s board rejects the bid Sam Altman pledges more openness as OpenAI works toward AGI Paris AI Summit: US, UK refuse to sign agreement on ‘safe’ and ‘inclusive’ AI as JD Vance sends warning Report says companies ‘playing with fire’ as AI chatbots fail when trying to summarize news Major publishers launch copyright lawsuit against AI startup Cohere At Developer Week, Mark Albertson dug into how intense interest in AI agents is colliding with AI security concerns: Building AI with AI: Developers scramble to keep pace with new applications as security concerns grow France announces €109B investment plan to boost AI ecosystem DataRobot buys Aqnostiq to advance AI agent development with dynamic compute orchestration Meta considers acquisition of Korean AI chip startup FuriosaAI (per Forbes) Tines nabs $125M for its AI-powered workflow automation platform Harrison.ai raises $112M for its AI medical diagnosis tools Legal AI startup Eudia launches with $105M to bring AI agents to legal teams Sardine raises $70M to expand AI risk platform Latent Labs raises $50M to develop new proteins with AI SpotDraft raises $54M to help legal teams manage contracts with AI Integrail raises $10M in seed funding for no-code agentic AI delivery platform OpenAI to launch GPT-5 in a matter of months, GPT-4.5 within weeks Workday unveils AI agent workforce management system Snowflake partners with Anthropic to release its first AI agents Baidu to open-source its Ernie large language model series Glean Technologies jumps into no-code agentic AI development with Agentworks Adobe launches commercially safe AI video model for creative professionals Amplitude integrates in-app surveys into its behavioral analysis platform F5 targets AI-era IT challenges with ADC 3.0 reference architectures Zilliz enhances AI cloud offering with enhanced ‘Bring Your Own Cloud’ capabilities Enterprise-sized implementations, bite-sized AI agents at ZohoDay25 There’s even more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Breaking Analysis: Investors cool on cloud but CEOs double down Report: Arm to build its own chips, and Meta is first in line to buy them Intel stock rose more than 20% this week after U.S. pushes TSMC to operate its factories, but it’s far from a done deal.

Title: Garry Ringrose looking forward to challenge of fighting for Irish centre spots

Having signed a new contract with Leinster and Ireland that will take him to the end of the 2027/28 season, Irish centre Garry Ringrose says that his plans are to become an even better player. The 30-year-old, who has won 65 Test caps since making his debut in 2016, establishing himself as an ever-present in Ireland’s midfield, said it was a privilege to stay in Dublin for another three years. Performance Director David Humphreys said at the announcement that he believed Ringrose’s better days were ahead. “That’s always what you’d be trying to aim to do,” said the outside centre. “I’m just delighted and feel privileged to be able to sign on for three years. It’s an unbelievable opportunity to work with some amazing coaches and then players that are keen to get better and improve. I’d be the same as that so massive opportunities ahead.” The competition for starting places in the Irish midfield with Bundee Aki, Robbie Henshaw, Ringrose and others has forced management into some rotation of the players with Ringrose having to be content with a starting from the bench against Scotland last weekend. “I think certainly as centres we’d be pretty open and relaxed amongst each other,” he said. “Over the last couple of years, we’ve all been challenged to play on any given week, either it’s rotation, injury, form, and what’s brilliant is it’s really competitive in training but then at the end of the day, certainly as a centre group, we just want to do our best to help the team win. “I don’t know if you ask myself, Bundee or Robbie at the moment that are rotating, and there’s a few guys that haven’t been in yet. That would be their answer as well. We’re all kind of on the same page from that perspective.” The former Blackrock College player was pleased with Ireland’s haul of 10 points from two matches against England and Scotland with Wales in Cardiff the team’s third challenge of the championship next weekend. “I mean to come away with 10 points from the first two games, we’re delighted from that perspective,” said Ringrose. “What’s been great is there’s been loads of good in the games, but then things we’re reviewing and looking back at and trying to get better at so we’re getting the best of both worlds I guess. To have 10 points in such a competitive group of teams, yeah we’re delighted.” Johnny Watterson is a sports writer with The Irish Times Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: How To Safely Spend Your Retirement Savings
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevevernon/2025/02/14/how-to-safely-spend-your-retirement-savings/
Time Published: 2025-02-14T16:00:00Z
Full Content:
Develop a realistic plan to safely spend your retirement savings Many retirees plan to spend their retirement savings quite frugally, according to a few recent reports and studies. For example, a recent survey report, To Spend or Not to Spend from Blackrock, shares that retirees prefer to keep their assets untouched and that just one in four survey respondents feel they need to spend the principal of their savings in retirement. According to the report, “For most, retirement is not a time to live it up, it is more important to feel financially secure.” Similarly, the 2024 Retirement Confidence Survey from the Employee Benefit Research Institute reported that more than one-third of retirees (38%) have a savings mindset, meaning they want to spend less and save for the future. If this mindset continues throughout life, some retirees might end up passing away with a lot of money in the bank, money they might have been able to spend and enjoy while they were alive. The Blackrock study identifies a few potential reasons for this phenomenon, including the possibility that retirees haven’t yet shifted their mindset from accumulating savings for retirement to spending money in retirement, that they’re afraid of outliving their money, or that they have a deep-seated fear they’ll experience a serious financial or health shock. While I don’t intend to chastise pre-retirees and retirees for being frugal, I do want them to know there’s a straightforward strategy they can use to safely spend their retirement savings. Appropriately, the strategy is called the Spend Safely in Retirement Strategy, and it’s based on robust research that I led at the Stanford Center on Longevity, in collaboration with the Society of Actuaries. We systematically analyzed and compared 292 retirement income strategies, using sophisticated analytical techniques. Two key metrics we used were the amount of lifetime retirement income you can expect as well as the amount of savings you can access at any point in time. Using these metrics, the Spend Safely Strategy (for short) compared favorably to the other 291 strategies we analyzed, many of which are much more complex. The Spend Safely Strategy is designed to withstand stock market crashes, and indeed, the financial turmoil caused by pandemic successfully stress-tested the strategy. The Spend Safely Strategy suggests developing sources of retirement income that will last the rest of your life, no matter how long you live. Then, it recommends you limit your monthly and annual spending to the amount of retirement income you expect to receive. To generate sources of lifetime retirement income, follow these three steps: If you want to preserve your retirement savings, the conservative RMD withdrawal rates might appeal to you. The rates are currently under 3% until age 66, under 4% until age 75, and under 5% until age 81. The Spend Safely Strategy is really a decision-making framework. You can customize it meet your own goals and circumstances. For example, you can make adjustments to achieve these goals: You can implement the Spend Safely Strategy in most IRAs or 401(k) plans, with or without the help of a financial advisor. If you work with an advisor, understanding the strategy can help you have an informed discussion with your advisor. The Spend Safely Strategy offers a realistic balance between frugality on the one hand and spending too much money and outliving your savings on the other. It may take some time and effort on your part to build your lifetime retirement income portfolio, but it’s a very good use of your time, considering that you should be planning to enjoy a retirement that lasts for 25 years or more.

Title: How To Find The Best Sector Mutual Funds 1Q25

Concept of mutual fund investment, showing with hands placing coins inside the piggy bank with ... [+] mutual fund sticker. With an ever-growing list of similar-sounding mutual funds to choose from, finding the best is an increasingly difficult task. How can investors change the game to shift the odds in their favor? There are at least 147 different Technology mutual funds and at least 588 mutual funds across eleven sectors. Do investors need 53+ choices on average per sector? How different can the mutual funds be? Those 147 Technology mutual funds are very different from each other. With anywhere from 26 to 317 holdings, many of these Technology mutual funds have drastically different portfolios with differing risk profiles and performance outlooks. The same is true for the mutual funds in any other sector, as each offers a very different mix of good and bad stocks. Consumer Non-cyclicals ranks first for stock selection. Utilities ranks last. I think the large number of sector mutual funds hurts investors more than it helps. Manually conducting a deep analysis for every fund is simply not a realistic option, exposing investors to insufficient analysis and missing profitable opportunities. Analyzing mutual funds, with the proper diligence, is far more difficult than analyzing stocks because it means analyzing all the stocks within each mutual fund. As stated above, there can be as many as 317 stocks or more for one mutual fund. Figure 1 shows the top rated mutual fund for each sector. Figure 1: The Best Mutual Fund in Each Sector Best Sector Mutual Funds 1Q25 * Best mutual funds exclude funds with TNAs less than $100 million for inadequate liquidity Amongst the mutual funds in Figure 1, BlackRock Energy Opportunities Fund (BACIX) ranks first overall, Fidelity Advisor Financials Fund (FIKBX) ranks second, and Fidelity Advisor Consumer Staples Fund (FIJCX) ranks third. Hennessy Gas Utility Fund (HGASX) ranks last. Why do you need to know the holdings of mutual funds before you buy? You need to be sure you do not buy a fund that might blow up. Buying a fund without analyzing its holdings is like buying a stock without analyzing its business and finances. No matter how cheap, if it holds bad stocks, the mutual fund’s performance will be bad. PERFORMANCE OF FUND’S HOLDINGS – FEES = PERFORMANCE OF FUND BlackRock Energy Opportunities Fund (BACIX) is not only the top-rated Energy mutual fund, but is also the overall top-ranked sector mutual fund out of the 588 sector mutual funds that my firm covers. The worst mutual fund in Figure 1 is Hennessy Gas Utility Fund (HGASX), which gets an Unattractive rating. One would think mutual fund providers could do better for this sector.

Title: The New Dawn Of Tokenization

Time Published: 2025-02-14T14:30:00Z
Full Content:
Charles Morey, CEO, MobilEyes Inc. In a world where technology is reshaping finance, tokenization emerges as a transformative force, enabling companies to raise capital without sacrificing equity. Through my work with tokenization strategies, I’ve seen its power to unlock non-dilutive IPOs and revolutionize taxation, equity structures and wealth distribution. By turning customers into stakeholders, tokenization is reshaping industries and redefining ownership. As this innovation paves the way for an inclusive financial future, we must address challenges before AI and robotics reshape the job landscape. At its core, tokenization converts real-world assets or rights into digital tokens on a blockchain. Tokens represent ownership or claims on assets, offering unmatched liquidity, transparency and security. Unlike traditional shares or bonds, tokenized assets are programmable for governance, revenue sharing and compliance. Here are some examples of tokenization in action: • Real Estate: Instead of purchasing an entire property, investors can buy fractionalized tokens that represent a share of ownership, earning proportional rental income and capital appreciation. According to ScienceSoft, "By 2030, the global market for tokenized real estate will reach up to $3 trillion and represent 15% of the real estate assets under management." • Art And Collectibles: High-value art and collectibles are being tokenized to allow broader participation by fractionalizing ownership. • Tokenization Of Capital: Companies can monetize future revenues or assets without issuing additional equity, avoiding shareholder dilution. For example, Janus Henderson’s Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund tokenized $11 million, allowing real-time trading and improved liquidity via blockchain. With major firms like BlackRock adopting this approach, tokenization is unlocking new market access, reducing costs and enhancing transparency. Traditionally, an initial public offering (IPO) involves selling shares of a company to the public, diluting existing shareholders' equity. Tokenization enables a new approach: • Tokenized Revenue Streams: Companies can tokenize future revenues to provide liquidity without sacrificing equity, a revolutionary approach that allows startups to preserve founder stakes while attracting long-term investors. The World Economic Forum (via HSBC) predicts that up to 10% of global GDP, or $24 trillion, could be transacted via distributed ledgers by 2027, underscoring tokenization's immense potential. Additionally, firms can tokenize assets like intellectual property, patents or renewable energy credits, creating collateralized growth opportunities and unlocking innovative funding mechanisms. • Tokenized Assets For Collateralized Growth: Firms can tokenize intellectual property, patents or even renewable energy credits to secure funding. Consider a tech startup with exponential growth potential but is wary of diluting its visionary founders’ stakes. By offering tokenized revenue participation rights, the startup can access capital while incentivizing long-term investor engagement. Tokenization combats predatory lending practices that burden startups with high-interest loans. In a press release published last year, the FTC described two separate cases that show how deceptive lending costs small businesses millions of dollars. The FTC settled $59 million in claims against companies exploiting the Paycheck Protection Program. Tokenization provides a fair, transparent alternative. In a different example, the FTC took decisive action against a company operating under the name "Seek Capital," which falsely marketed itself as a provider of business loans. Tokenization does more than reshape fundraising; it redefines taxation and compliance frameworks: • Transparent Taxation: Blockchain technology streamlines tax compliance by enabling real-time, automated tax calculations and reporting, reducing errors and compliance burdens. PwC highlights how blockchain can automate business rules, expedite VAT refunds and enhance audit efficiency, significantly cutting costs. • Tokenized Tax Credits: Industries like renewable energy and agriculture could tokenize tax credits, creating liquid markets for businesses to buy and sell these benefits efficiently. In a tokenized world, opportunities for wealth creation become more equitable and accessible. Tokenized structures can: • Democratize Access To Investments: Tokenization enables everyday investors to access asset classes once limited to the wealthy. According to Boston Consulting Group, tokenized assets under management could reach more than $600 billion by 2030, unlocking opportunities and fostering inclusivity in financial markets. • Enable Crowdsourced Public Goods: Governments could issue tokenized bonds linked to specific infrastructure projects, allowing citizens to invest directly in community improvements. • Empower Underserved Communities: Imagine Native American tribes tokenizing land rights to secure capital while preserving sovereignty. Through tokenization, I aim to create a new paradigm where businesses harness non-dilutive capital solutions and where individuals reap the financial benefits of assets previously beyond their reach. For example: • Pre-IPO High-Yield Accounts: Companies meeting specific tokenization standards could offer high-yield investment accounts that grow in value over five to 10 years, rewarding investors while increasing enterprise value. • Dividend Tokens: Token holders receive dividends linked to crypto or real-world profits, incentivizing long-term participation and stability. • Automated Compliance/Wealth-Building Mechanisms: Smart contracts tied to tokenized revenue streams could manage compliance, automate dividends and even distribute carbon credits. Tokenization’s impact will extend beyond finance into societal transformation: • Public Safety: Systems like my patent-pending MobilEyes platform could tokenize compliance data, creating incentives for transparent law enforcement and real-time public accountability. Research from SoundThinking shows that 42% of Americans believe a lack of transparency harms trust in law enforcement. • Music And Creative Economies: Tokenized royalties could ensure artists are paid instantly and fairly, cutting out intermediaries. The revolution of tokenization is here, and its potential to reshape sectors, industries and individual prosperity is limitless.

Title: Bitcoin's 2024 Return Against Equities

2024 Returns and Volatility Bitcoin fared quite well in 2024 against traditional assets like bonds, gold, real estate, and the equity market as a whole. But how does it compare to individual stocks? This matters for stock pickers, and for framing Bitcoin in terms of other major technological movements in the economy. Bitcoin had an annual 2024 return of 114%. The return and volatility are both much higher than the asset classes of bonds, real estate, gold, and the entire equity market. However, the risk-adjusted winner of 2024 was Palantir (PLTR), which captured a return of 353% and a slightly higher volatility than BTC. MicroStrategy (MSTR) came in close second, finishing out at a return of 338%, but at a much higher volatility. MicroStrategy would have handily beaten PLTR in November when its return YTD was 497%, but MSTR shed much value in the last six weeks of the year from aggressive bitcoin buying, powered by equity dilution. Even Nvidia (NVDA) offered a higher risk and return, with an annual return in 2024 of 187%. The major tech companies (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta) all offered lower risk and lower returns to Bitcoin. You can see that Bitcoin generally sits on the capital market line of risk and return, with MicroStrategy on one end and government bonds (GOVT) on the other. PLTR is an outlier, but so are companies like Tesla, Coinbase, and Marathon, which all offered lower returns and greater risk. Even the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) roughly matched Bitcoin’s return, but it was more volatile. Now, let’s take a look at a broader universe of equities. Let's sample the companies in the S&P 500 above a $10 billion market cap. A random sample of these companies on the risk and return chart looks like: 2024 Returns and Volatility Again, notice the pattern. Some companies have higher returns than Bitcoin in 2024, but also higher risk, like Nvidia and Palantir. Other companies have less return and less risk, like Disney and Nike. Some are strictly worse, with greater risk but lower return, like Tesla and Micron Technology. There was one company in the S&P 500 that offered a better deal than Bitcoin, with lower risk and greater return. To find it, here's a sample of the companies from the S&P 500 without the $10 billion minimal market capitalization threshold: 2024 Returns and Volatility Here you can see that Sea Limited had an annual return of almost 200%, and a volatility just shy of Bitcoin’s. Have you heard of Sea Limited? Neither have I. So, indeed there may be a better investment than Bitcoin in any one year. But the chances of finding this one company among 500 is small. This proves my point that Bitcoin really is an asset class, not just another single investment. And its risk and return should be compared to other asset classes, not just to other single stocks.

Title: What’s Happening With ROKU Stock?

POLAND - 2025/02/01: In this photo illustration, the Roku company logo is seen displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Roku stock surged by approximately 14% in pre-market trading on Friday, bringing its year-to-date gains to over 30%. The increase follows Roku’s stronger-than-expected Q4 2024 results, with total revenue climbing 22% to $1.2 billion. Roku’s platform business revenue, which includes subscription and ad sales on Roku devices, exceeded $1 billion, reflecting a 25% year-over-year increase. Separately, with uncertainty surrounding the company, see What’s Next For U.S. Steel Stock After A Mixed Q4? Roku’s momentum continues to build. The company recently reported that its global streaming TV household count reached 89.8 million by the end of December and surpassed 90 million in early January. This represents an increase from 85.5 million in Q3 and 80 million in Q4 2023, marking a 12.5% year-over-year rise. Roku also revealed that its smart TVs and streaming boxes now reach nearly half of all U.S. broadband households, a positive development for its high-margin platform business. Viewer engagement is increasing as more users shift from traditional television to streaming. In Q4, total streaming hours reached 34 billion, up 18% year-over-year. With its extensive data on user behavior, ad performance, and engagement, Roku has ample room for expansion. Additionally, the company has implemented cost controls, limiting operating expense growth to just 2% year-over-year—well below revenue growth. Workforce and office space reductions in 2024 contributed to this efficiency. Operating profit rose 17% to $512.6 million, while free cash flow for 2024 stood at $203 million. As prior investments in research and product development continue to bear fruit, Roku has significant potential to improve its margins. See a scenario on how Roku stock could reach $200. ROKU stock has experienced volatility over the past four years, with yearly returns fluctuating significantly compared to the S&P 500. The stock delivered returns of -31% in 2021, -82% in 2022, 125% in 2023, and -19% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, a curated selection of 30 stocks, has been considerably less volatile while outperforming the S&P 500 over the same period. Why? HQ Portfolio stocks have historically delivered better risk-adjusted returns, avoiding the extreme fluctuations seen in ROKU stock, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. With ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, including interest rate decisions and global conflicts, will ROKU struggle as it did in 2021, 2022, and 2024, or could it stage a recovery? Separately, after weaker than expected guidance caused a decline, see Is WST Stock Undervalued At $200? Currently, Roku stock trades at approximately 3x the consensus 2025 revenue estimate, significantly below the double-digit multiples seen in 2021. However, the company faces increasing competition for ad revenue from major players such as Netflix, Meta, and Alphabet. We estimate Roku’s fair value at $78 per share, which is below its current market price. We are updating our Roku model to reflect its Q4 earnings.

Title: Elon Musk's X is pulling big-name advertisers back

Happy Valentine's Day! In the spirit of the holiday, here's something you might fall in love with: A new Apple product. Tim Cook teased the launch of something set for next Wednesday. In today's big story, new and old advertisers are coming to X more than two years after Elon Musk's dramatic takeover. What's on deck Markets: Three charts that show Robinhood's incredible rise over the past 12 months. Tech: Meta CTO says employees who think 'everyone has to like' its policy changes should 'quit' and 'consider working elsewhere.' Business: Everything you need to know about new US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. But first, back like they never left. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. After a tumultuous few years, X is pulling advertisers back. The platform formerly known as Twitter has grown its pool of advertisers in recent months, according to an analysis by Business Insider's Lara O'Reilly. Big-name brands like Apple have returned to the platform alongside newcomers. It's a notable turnaround for a company that has, at times, been outwardly hostile to advertisers following Elon Musk's 2022 buyout. X has sued several big advertisers for what it claims was a coordinated ad boycott. To be clear, the turnaround isn't complete. While X enjoyed a 15% year-over-year increase in the number of companies buying ads, its estimated US ad revenue dropped 28% during that same time period, according to research firm MediaRadar. However, X is also leaning on ad tech partners, as Lara has previously reported, which tends to lead to lower prices compared to using an internal sales team. Even if advertisers are cautious about working with X, they might not have many other social media options. Meta's recent policy changes around content moderation were somewhat inspired by X. TikTok's future remains in limbo. And alternatives like Bluesky are still a fraction of the size of X. There's another good data point for X. Banks have seen increased interest from investors in the debt they hold from financing Musk's 2022 deal. Bloomberg reported on Thursday that Morgan Stanley was upping its offering of X debt from $3 billion to $4.74 billion. Big names like Pimco and Citadel have already jumped in, according to The Wall Street Journal. (It's also worth noting that X's stake in xAI, Musk's buzzy AI startup, was also reportedly used to attract potential investors.) Not too long ago, X's debt was basically considered nuclear waste. The seven banks that loaned Musk the $13 billion to buy Twitter were unable to move the loans, leaving it to clog up their balance sheets. Of course, there's another factor that has nothing to do with X's performance enticing advertisers to return and investors to buy its debt: Musk's close ties to President Donald Trump. Doing business with X could keep a company in Musk's good graces. And staying on good terms with the guy who has the ear of the most powerful person in the world certainly isn't a bad thing. US congressmen sound the alarm on 'secret' Apple order from UK. Read their letter. 1. Robinhood's rapid rise. The brokerage's earnings blew past analyst expectations, the latest in an incredible run that's seen its shares up almost 440% over the past year. These three charts show how a surge in newly funded accounts and a crypto boom have helped the app. 2. Want to invest like the world's best? Start here. Every few months, BI takes a look at where top investors are betting at least 20% of their portfolio. Warren Buffett has continued to reduce his position in Apple stocks, while Baupost Group's Seth Klarman has bought up more shares of telecommunications company Liberty Global. Here are nine stocks whales are making big bets on. 3. Betting on China. Druckenmiller protégé Beeneet Kothari of Tekne Capital isn't afraid of investing in China despite President Trump's trade war. A lot of Western capital has already left the country, softening the blow to Chinese stocks, he said. So, where to start? China has been getting a lot of attention lately due to DeepSeek, and robotics is another strength. 1. xAI has been working on a 'DeepSearch' feature, employees say. Data annotators at Elon Musk's AI startup have been working on the project, dubbed "DeepSearch," to train Grok to perform multi-step research projects the same way a human might, two workers said. It could compete with features from rivals OpenAI and Google, but it's unclear what stage the project is at or whether xAI will ultimately release something. 2. "Leave or disagree and commit." That's what Meta's Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth recently told staffers in response to employee concerns over Meta's recent policy changes. The company changed its approach to internal Q&A sessions to limit leaks to the media. In Meta's internal forum, Bosworth said, "if your view is 'everyone has to like all the policies we have and if they don't it is appropriate to leak' then I think you should consider working elsewhere." 3. The Amazon of travel. Airbnb's CEO Brian Chesky said the app should "be one place you go for all of your traveling and living needs," in an earnings call on Thursday. The company plans to invest $200 million to $250 million in launching new businesses and offerings, which it says will be rolled out in May. Its stock price jumped 15% after the announcement in after hours trading. 1. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to call the shots on health policy. The new US health secretary may be known for his skepticism over vaccines — despite denying an anti-vaccine stance in his confirmation hearings — but RFK Jr. will have even more policy issues on his plate. Here's what the appointee could mean for you and your family. 2. Dozens of Office of Personnel Management probationary workers were abruptly fired. Around 60 employees were terminated in a group video call Thursday afternoon and told their work accounts would be deactivated by 3 pm ET, which gave them about 20 minutes. Two employees told BI that union representatives were not present in the meeting. 3. President Trump wants his education secretary pick to "put herself out of a job." Trump hasn't been shy about wanting to shut down the Department of Education. That could have a ripple effect on grants, student loans, outcomes data, and discrimination claims. And if Trump's plan goes through, other agencies may need to bear the burden. Axel Springer CEO talks trade, Trump, AI, and the future of media. 2025 NBA All-Star Weekend begins.

Title: Price Hikes, Enshittification Trigger 700K Customer Losses At Disney+, ESPN+

Full Content:
Culture Now that streaming subscriber growth has slowed, we’ve noted repeatedly how the streaming TV sector is falling into all of the bad habits that ultimately doomed traditional cable TV. That has involved chasing pointless “growth of growth’s sake” megamergers and imposing bottomless price hikes and new annoying restrictions (like equating password sharing with “piracy”) — all while simultaneously cutting corners on product quality in a bid to give Wall Street that sweet, impossible, unlimited quarterly growth it demands. Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ (all now owned by the same company thanks to consolidation) all recently raised prices to access streaming catalogs of deteriorating quality. Some of Disney’s price hikes were as much as 25 percent, hitting ad-based and ad-free versions alike. Customers were quick to complain. So not surprisingly, Disney+ has now seen the first quarterly subscriber loss in the streaming platform’s history, with 700,000 customers cancelling service. ESPN+, ESPN’s streaming service, also saw a 700,000 subscriber loss: “Total paid Disney+ subscriptions currently rest at 124.6 million compared with 125.3 million at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter. ESPN+ also saw a loss of 700,000 subscribers, currently at 24.9 million, compared with 25.6 million at the end of last quarter.” Publicly-traded companies can’t just provide a quality, affordable service people like. That’s simply not allowed. They have to provide Wall Street ever-escalating quarterly returns in the pursuit of scale, even if that pursuit proves disastrous. If it’s not possible to achieve those returns through innovation and subscriber growth (which is no longer possible now that the streaming market is saturated), that’s when big companies get in trouble and start creatively nickel-and-diming their user base. Traditional cable TV, of course, went through this exact life cycle. And despite the fact many of those executives have shifted over to streaming, they’ve learned nothing from history or experience because they’re not financially incentivized to learn from experience. They’re incentivized to make stock values climb at any cost, then flee when things get rough; fat executive or investor compensation in hand. Which is to say don’t expect things to change, even if the economy tightens and customers increasingly balk at higher streaming video prices. I’d expect two major trends in streaming over the next few years. One, a significant uptick in pointless, shitty mergers that trigger layoffs, huge debt loads, more price hikes to recoup that debt, and steady product quality erosion (see: the whole AT&T→Time Warner→Discovery mess). Media execs are very excited for the Trump administration to rubber stamp even more problematic consolidation. Two, I suspect companies will work tirelessly to make cancelling streaming services (a major advantage over traditional bloated cable TV) more difficult, whether that means complicated wireless/broadband bundling that makes dumping services a confusing hassle (is your Hulu subscription discount tied to your Amazon or wireless bill?), or some creative new restrictions we haven’t seen previously. Filed Under: disney plus, enshittification, espn plus, price hikes, streaming, television, tv, video Companies: disney In terms of entshittification, Disney has made it even worse: the ad-free subscription tier is no longer a guarantee of avoiding ads. If I didn’t know any better, I would say they’re actively trying to get people to pirate their content. TBF, Disney’s only following Amazon in enshittification. I dunno about that. Changing the terms and conditions just so people can’t sue for false advertising is more shitty to me. It sounds bad, and I haven’t reviewed the specific agreements, but many web site agreements require users to hold them harmless and even indemnify them. In other words, if you sued them, you’d be paying their legal bills and any amount the court awarded you. In theory. It’s such an absurd result that it’s hard to believe a court would uphold it; I’m not sure any company’s even tried. My point is, “you can’t sue for false advertising” is actually a much better clause than the usual “you can’t sue for anything ever”. (I found such a clause in the terms of the payment provider my landlord wanted me to sign up with—a company that wanted access to pull money directly from my bank account while offloading all responsibility for their errors onto me. Needless to say, I complained, and I’m using checks again like it’s the 1980s.) In theory. It’s such an absurd result that it’s hard to believe a court would uphold it; I’m not sure any company’s even tried. My point is, “you can’t sue for false advertising” is actually a much better clause than the usual “you can’t sue for anything ever”. Oh, no worries, Disney covered that as well. People really need to start treating this shit as they’d treat actual contracts. If Disney handed guests a binder of legalese to sign before being let into the park, well, the lawyers would be happy, because their kids would be walking right onto otherwise-deserted rides. But the company would probably have to backtrack pretty quickly, just as Walmart would if they made everyone sign the printed walmart.com agreement and its ancillary policies before entering a store. Somehow, if it’s online, people will be eager to agree to literally almost anything. I find that people sign paper contracts in person that are also onerous and stupid because society has forced them to turn off their brains and has forced them to blow exorbitant amounts of cash they don’t have on things they wouldn’t need if they wern’t structured to force these needs. Then there are also those who sign just cuz they want stuff, which is also frequently a social disease. So, should it be called “endisneyfication”? That was already a thing, but you can roll all the stupid Disney behaviors up in that coinage. [I]s your Hulu subscription discount tied to your Amazon or wireless bill? They almost got me with the last one until I read the fine print. So Disney+ lost 700k customers. On a total of over 150 million subscribers, that’s less than half a percent. I imagine their departure was more than made up for with the price hike for the remaining customers. I guess the beancounters are striving for a balance between raising prices fast enough to appease the stock market and slow enough so less customers bail. Anyway, they’re not in this business for the entertainment value or the service to their customers. Hard to say. Even if they’re making the money back from increasing fees, it doesn’t look good to the shareholders that they lost almost 1.5 million subscribers across two platforms. Especially for the ad-based products. If raising prices results in fewer subscriptions but the total profit is up, I can’t see investors having an issue with that. But if raising prices is impacting ad impressions… THAT has a cascade effect. It’s shocking they have that many subscribers given how Usanians keep complaining they can’t even afford food. Subscribe through a burner credit card. Subscribe through a burner credit card. That’s a better answer than simply no longer paying their monthly bills. But I must confess, how does one obtain a ‘burner’ card… without being totally dishonest about one’s identity in the first place? Credit issuers have their own rules about these kinds of things, let alone the laws regarding fraud, etc. My version of a ‘burner’ is where my debit and credit cards are issued by a credit union. At my union, I have the power to designate a black list of companies no longer permitted to lay charges against my card/account. Wherein I am honest and don’t wait for the service provider to cut me off, I simply stop using the service entirely, on my own. My premise is that if they turn me into collections, they’ll have to provide documentation that I never tried to cancel through their ‘official’ channel(s), and that I did indeed use the service and then failed to pay for it. I’ve told more than one collection outfit to get me those proofs, beyond just a simple billing statement, and for sure, it’s never happened. It’s worked so far. N.B. Note that states may have different laws regarding the necessary proof. What I described is what my state requires, your state may be different. I do know that collectors will try to skate around these laws and brute-force you into paying, but hold your ground. Or at the very least, get educated on what your state allows (or requires) a collector to do. I use virtual credit cards. If they won’t let me unsubscribe then I can just cancel the card. It works because the amounts are too small to take you to court, or for a debt collector to put in much effort. But, technically, you’d be on the hook for fees till you canceled, and we don’t know whether a court would accept a “it was too hard to cancel” defense. Only if they continued to provide you the service during all of that time. While that works for the archetypical impossible to cancel gym membership, that’s because those who wish to stop paying also wish to stop going to the gym. If Disney was actually giving everyone who stopped paying “free” access to Disney+, it would not go well for them. It’s getting very visible in my bubble. Piracy is flourishing again. Of course these companies will point to piracy as the cause of their losses, no the consequence as it actually is. And they’ll extract huge figures incompatible with their actual self-imposed losses and generally taken from their collective arses. could boycotts also be affecting subs? 700k subscribers lost against 125 million overall, with 24 million on ESPN+ alone, means total subscribers went down 3%, which isn’t nothing. It is directly tied to the price increase from $9.99 to $15. It does feel like the current strategy of all major businesses is to kill themselves, from Reddit and Twitter locking their APIs to Netflix and Disney+ increasing their prices for no good reason. Tesla went from being the cool electric car company to the car people are embarrassed to drive and have to slap bumper stickers on saying they bought it before Elon became a fascist president unelect. Most of Teslas revenue last year was from licensing [https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-crypto-tesla-earnings-stock-elon-musk-trump-accounting-ev-2025-1?op=1](and selling cryptocurrencies), it seems. All that being said, you forgot to call anyone brunchlords, Karl, so this article is bad and you are a monster. I made this account to leave this comment. Thumbs down, unsubscribbled. Disgusting. #dobetterkarl Rough back-of-the-envelope est is ESPN/ABC is locked into ~$4B/yr in sportsball contracts. To make it worse, NBA ratings are down 5% this year. So losing even 700K subscribers is going to leave a mark It does feel like the current strategy of all major businesses is to kill themselves It may feel like it, but is it happening? Are they dying? Certainly Disney isn’t. Video entertainment is an oligopoly, and the copyright monopolists can abuse their position to withhold stuff from any companies who’d want to undercut them. People still refer to permissionless downloading as “piracy” and illegal (which it’s not in most countries), and have a general feeling of “wrongness.” I think it’s too soon to tell with Tesla. It could end up like Enron, but for now its stock price and sales remain high. “Fascist president unelect” might be a selling point for Trump voters who wouldn’t otherwise be interested in electric cars. People still refer to permissionless downloading as “piracy” and illegal (which it’s not in most countries), and have a general feeling of “wrongness.” I’m not sure that’s true. Piracy is a copyright violation almost everywhere. Unless you mean de facto legal, then yeah. I’m not sure that’s true. Piracy is a copyright violation almost everywhere. Uploading copyrighted stuff without permission is usually illegal (though rarely criminal at non-commercial scale). Downloading is usually not, and in fact is sometimes explicitly legal due to copyright levies. they’ve learned nothing from history or experience To be fair, it’s not that they don’t learn. Capitalism dictates that revenue must go up. If they weren’t using the main leverage they have to make the line go up, they’d be replaced. Short of changing the rules of capitalism, there’s no other end than enshittification for such large enterprises. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Will Vanguard action trigger cost-cuts in domestic AMCs too?

The fee reductions are expected to save investors more than $350 million this year alone,” it said in a statement. Lower costs leave more money in investors’ hands and raise their potential returns. Indeed, across the industry, lower-cost funds have historically outperformed higher-cost funds on a net-of-expenses basis, Vanguard reasoned. The average asset-weighted expense ratio would be just 0.07 per cent for Vanguard across its $10 trillion under management — a sliver of the industry average of 0.44 per cent, said a Bloomberg report. It’s going to be a catch-22 situation for its rivals such as Blackrock, Invesco and State Street Corp on whether to follow suit at the cost of their profits. Between 2004 and 2023, the asset-weighted average expense ratio fell from 0.87 per cent to 0.36 per cent, according to Morningstar Inc, that tracks the performance of mutual funds globally. In India, SEBI allows slab-based total expense ratios for various categories of schemes, such as equity, debt, hybrid, and solution-oriented funds. Accordingly, equity funds can charge up to 2.25 per cent, non-equity schemes can charge up to 2 per cent as the base expense ratio. SEBI has been working hard to bring down expense ratio. It, in fact, had suggested calculating TER including brokerage fee and GST on management fee at the asset management company level rather than at the scheme level. “This approach was aimed to provide a more holistic view on expenses incurred by mutual funds,” SEBI had then said. The regulator, however, put this proposal on hold after feedback from MF industry body AMFI. The consultation process is currently going on. As per SEBI study, the industry average TER, including additional expenses charged by the regular plan of different open-ended schemes during the financial year 2021–22, stood at 2 per cent for equity schemes, 0.77 per cent for debt schemes, 1.88 per cent for hybrid schemes, and 0.11 per cent for ETFs. This ratio has further slipped currently. For instance, the TER has slipped to 1.4 per cent in January. According to SEBI, retail investors invested more than 57.18 per cent of their investment in equity schemes and 17.49 per cent in hybrid schemes and the remaining 25.33 per cent in debt schemes, ETFs and other schemes such as index funds, solution oriented schemes, fund of funds, and so on. The AUM of the Indian MF industry has grown from ₹11.81 trillion as on January 31, 2015 to ₹67.25 trillion as on January 31, 2025 more than 5-fold increase in a span of 10 years. According to SPIVA Global (S&P Indices Versus Active), the first half of 2024 proved to be a particularly challenging market environment for active managers across global equity markets, as the outperformance of the very largest companies resulted in a high proportion of index constituents underperforming the benchmark return. In India, 77 per cent of actively managed Indian Equity Large-Cap funds trailed the S&P India LargeMidCap’s total return of 17.4 per cent at the end of June 2024. At 52 per cent, It is relatively better for mid/small-cap funds underperformed the S&P India SmallCap’s and 94 per cent of Indian Composite Bond funds and 74 per cent of Indian Government Bond funds lagged the 5.3 per cent return of the iBoxx ALBI India. However, it is interesting to see, in the current downtrend, how many mid and small-cap schemes have managed to outperform the respective indices. The probability of a greater number of schemes underperforming the indices is higher given the constant selling pressure in that space. In this scenario, lower expense ratio would no doubt enhance the return for the investors. With more and more players such as Jio BlackRock, Capitalmind, Choice International, Cosmea Financial Holdings, Angel One and Unifi Capital entering the AMC space, one could hope for further lowering of cost due to competition and growth in AUM.

Title: High Electric Bills Are the Tip of the Iceberg

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/14/2025 4:53:51 AM PST by MtnClimber U.S. electric rates are going up. In Missouri, Ameren increased residential power bills by 11% less than two years ago, and now it is seeking another 15% increase, per the Public Service Commission (PSC). According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), rate increases were experienced in 43 American states between 2023 and 2024. The EIA also reported record rate increases between 2021 and 2024 projections. In California, the Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) was granted six rate increases in 2024. Local ABC 30 Action News reported that The Utility Reform Network estimated that residents had experienced a $50 average increase to their bill before the last of these increases took effect. In New York City, Consolidated Edison Inc. (Con Edison) recently proposed an 11.4% rate increase for its electricity service, according to Energy and Environment News by Politico. An 8.79% electric rate increase was recently approved for We Energy (WE) in Wisconsin, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, which also serves Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota, per Wisconsin Public Radio. All of these companies are publicly owned, and they are just a tiny fraction of the American electric companies working to appease their top shareholders: BlackRock and Vanguard. During the Jan. 15 public hearing to discuss Ameren Missouri’s proposed rate increase, Ameren Missouri vice president of regulatory and legislative affairs Warren Wood noted that the $446-million overall increase was proposed to offer a “fair return to shareholders.” According to Ameren’s Nasdaq listing, the company’s top shareholder is Vanguard Group Inc., a global hedge fund investment company focused on assessing “climate risk” and “net zero emissions.” BlackRock Inc. is Ameren’s third top shareholder, another global investment hedge fund focused on climate change. BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group Inc. are also the top shareholders of Con Edison, PG&E, and the WEC (Excerpt) Read more at americanthinker.com ...

I do not understand, we have made our wind investments, kept our power plants open, the grid isnt a fire hazard and have low natural gas prices at the exchange points. If inflation would just take a break the constant rate increases could be rejected, but at this point nobody can say that the power companies are to far ahead of the facts. 3 posted on 02/14/2025 5:00:25 AM PST by protoconservative (Been Conservative Before You Were Born ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: protoconservative I’d suggest you provided part of your answer: “we have made our wind investments” 4 posted on 02/14/2025 5:01:47 AM PST by 9YearLurker [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Yeah. Oh what a day! Here in Alabama, we are enjoying being on the list I saw on the tube the other day as the 5th highest electric bills in the nation. Wow.

And we are doing all we can to hold our usage down. The 9 degrees temps we had a couple of weeks ago did not help!! Bama ain’t use to 9 and 12 degree temps. Ave in Jan is usually 53 high and 32 lows.

The EIA also reported record rate increases between 2021 and 2024 projections. In California, the Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) was granted six rate increases in 2024. Local ABC 30 Action News reported that The Utility Reform Network estimated that residents had experienced a $50 average increase to their bill before the last of these increases took effect. In New York City, Consolidated Edison Inc. (Con Edison) recently proposed an 11.4% rate increase for its electricity service, according to Energy and Environment News by Politico. An 8.79% electric rate increase was recently approved for We Energy (WE) in Wisconsin, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, which also serves Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota, per Wisconsin Public Radio. All of these companies are publicly owned, and they are just a tiny fraction of the American electric companies working to appease their top shareholders: BlackRock and Vanguard. During the Jan. 15 public hearing to discuss Ameren Missouri’s proposed rate increase, Ameren Missouri vice president of regulatory and legislative affairs Warren Wood noted that the $446-million overall increase was proposed to offer a “fair return to shareholders.” According to Ameren’s Nasdaq listing, the company’s top shareholder is Vanguard Group Inc., a global hedge fund investment company focused on assessing “climate risk” and “net zero emissions.” BlackRock Inc. is Ameren’s third top shareholder, another global investment hedge fund focused on climate change.

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/14/2025 4:53:51 AM PST by MtnClimber U.S. electric rates are going up. In Missouri, Ameren increased residential power bills by 11% less than two years ago, and now it is seeking another 15% increase, per the Public Service Commission (PSC). According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), rate increases were experienced in 43 American states between 2023 and 2024. The EIA also reported record rate increases between 2021 and 2024 projections. In California, the Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) was granted six rate increases in 2024. Local ABC 30 Action News reported that The Utility Reform Network estimated that residents had experienced a $50 average increase to their bill before the last of these increases took effect. In New York City, Consolidated Edison Inc. (Con Edison) recently proposed an 11.4% rate increase for its electricity service, according to Energy and Environment News by Politico. An 8.79% electric rate increase was recently approved for We Energy (WE) in Wisconsin, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, which also serves Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota, per Wisconsin Public Radio. All of these companies are publicly owned, and they are just a tiny fraction of the American electric companies working to appease their top shareholders: BlackRock and Vanguard. During the Jan. 15 public hearing to discuss Ameren Missouri’s proposed rate increase, Ameren Missouri vice president of regulatory and legislative affairs Warren Wood noted that the $446-million overall increase was proposed to offer a “fair return to shareholders.” According to Ameren’s Nasdaq listing, the company’s top shareholder is Vanguard Group Inc., a global hedge fund investment company focused on assessing “climate risk” and “net zero emissions.” BlackRock Inc. is Ameren’s third top shareholder, another global investment hedge fund focused on climate change. BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group Inc. are also the top shareholders of Con Edison, PG&E, and the WEC (Excerpt) Read more at americanthinker.com ...

The EIA also reported record rate increases between 2021 and 2024 projections. In California, the Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) was granted six rate increases in 2024. Local ABC 30 Action News reported that The Utility Reform Network estimated that residents had experienced a $50 average increase to their bill before the last of these increases took effect. In New York City, Consolidated Edison Inc. (Con Edison) recently proposed an 11.4% rate increase for its electricity service, according to Energy and Environment News by Politico. An 8.79% electric rate increase was recently approved for We Energy (WE) in Wisconsin, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, which also serves Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota, per Wisconsin Public Radio. All of these companies are publicly owned, and they are just a tiny fraction of the American electric companies working to appease their top shareholders: BlackRock and Vanguard. During the Jan. 15 public hearing to discuss Ameren Missouri’s proposed rate increase, Ameren Missouri vice president of regulatory and legislative affairs Warren Wood noted that the $446-million overall increase was proposed to offer a “fair return to shareholders.” According to Ameren’s Nasdaq listing, the company’s top shareholder is Vanguard Group Inc., a global hedge fund investment company focused on assessing “climate risk” and “net zero emissions.” BlackRock Inc. is Ameren’s third top shareholder, another global investment hedge fund focused on climate change.

(Con Edison) recently proposed an 11.4% rate increase for its electricity service, according to Energy and Environment News by Politico. An 8.79% electric rate increase was recently approved for We Energy (WE) in Wisconsin, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, which also serves Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota, per Wisconsin Public Radio. All of these companies are publicly owned, and they are just a tiny fraction of the American electric companies working to appease their top shareholders: BlackRock and Vanguard. During the Jan. 15 public hearing to discuss Ameren Missouri’s proposed rate increase, Ameren Missouri vice president of regulatory and legislative affairs Warren Wood noted that the $446-million overall increase was proposed to offer a “fair return to shareholders.” According to Ameren’s Nasdaq listing, the company’s top shareholder is Vanguard Group Inc., a global hedge fund investment company focused on assessing “climate risk” and “net zero emissions.” BlackRock Inc. is Ameren’s third top shareholder, another global investment hedge fund focused on climate change.

Goldman Sachs loaded up on bitcoin and ethereum ETFs in the fourth quarter, increasing its ethereum ETF holdings by 2,000% and growing its bitcoin ETF holding to over $1.5 billion, according to a regulatory filing. The funds bought by Goldman Sachs included BlackRock’s bitcoin and etheruem ETFs, as well as funds controlled by Fidelity and Grayscale. 02/14 update: Crypto prices have climbed over the last 24 hours, with small gains for bitcoin and ethereum being dwarfed by Ripple’s XRP, which has surged 10% after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged filings from crypto asset manager Grayscale to list spot XRP and the memecoin dogecoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “While this doesn’t guarantee approval, it begins a process for public feedback,” analysts with Tagus Capital wrote in an emailed note. “Grayscale’s XRP ETF, filed in January and amended in February, is now under review with up to a 240-day approval period. The SEC's acknowledgment is seen as a positive shift from its previous stance, as it shows openness to these products.” The race for the next U.S. spot crypto ETF is now between bitcoin offshoot litecoin, ethereum rival solana, XRP and dogecoin, with Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas predicting earlier this month that XRP and dogecoin ETF bids have a 65% and 75% chance of being approved before the end of 2025. BlackRock led a campaign to get a spot bitcoin ETF approved in the U.S. through 2023, with a fleet of bitcoin funds making their debut in January 2024 before surging to become some of the fastest growing ETFs of all time. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets for the first time in November, led by BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) which now has just over $60 billion in assets under management. However, the importance of Goldman’s bet on bitcoin and ethereum via ETFs has been played down one analyst. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed over the last year, helped by Wall Street adoption and Donald Trump's ... [+] embrace of bitcoin, ethereum and crypto. “This position by Goldman Sachs, similar to many other banks and hedge funds, is not a net long position,” said Coindesk senior analyst James Van Straten. "This is a strategy that reflects the basis trade, also known as the cash and carry trade, balancing potential profits and risks for bitcoin price fluctuations. The ETFs recently had options approved on them so this is most likely directional hedging." Last month, BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink revealed he’s had discussions with sovereign wealth funds about buying bitcoin and predicted such conversations could catapult the bitcoin price to $700,000 per bitcoin. "If everyone adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per bitcoin," Fink, who led the Wall Street rush into bitcoin and crypto last year via a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), told Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

The UK-based bank now holds 2,473,064 shares of IBIT, valued at $131 million as of December 31, as per the Thursday filing. The purchase took place during the fourth quarter, spanning October to December, and coincides with the post-election surge in the Bitcoin price, which is now trading at a price of $97,030.17, up 0.8% over the past day, per CoinGecko data. The filing shows that Barclays’ move follows a trend in institutional adoption of crypto-related products, with banking giants such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan also raking up Bitcoin ETF holdings in recent months. As BTC surged to a record high of $109,000 just before the U.S. presidential inauguration, big players are seized the opportunity to capitalize on the crypto’s rise without directly owning BTC itself. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has made it easier for these institutions to get exposure to BTC, while sidestepping some of the volatility and regulatory concerns surrounding direct crypto ownership. Goldman Sachs, for instance, reported a 121% jump in its Bitcoin ETF holdings, bringing its total stake to $1.57 billion. Banking giant JPMorgan recently reported an increase in its BTC fund exposure in its latest filing, which now totals $964,322. In January 2025, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs saw a massive $5 billion in inflows, a trend expected to continue in 2025 with forecasts of over $50 billion in inflows, as per Farside Investors data. BlackRock’s IBIT saw the largest net inflows during January, pulling in $3.2 billion, followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $1.3 billion. In January alone, IBIT pulled in $3.2 billion, making it the top-performing Bitcoin ETF of the month, followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with nearly $1.3 billion in inflows. Analysts are predicting more gains for BTC in the coming years, with projections suggesting it could reach as high as $200,000 by late 2025. Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Title: AI Companies: 4 PR Strategies You Can’t Afford To Ignore
URL: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesagencycouncil/2025/02/14/ai-companies-4-pr-strategies-you-cant-afford-to-ignore/
Time Published: 2025-02-14T12:30:00Z

Heather Kelly is the CEO of Next PR, an award-winning, full-service public relations firm with offices across the U.S. AI isn’t just having a moment; its meteoric rise is rewriting the rules of innovation. Alongside the enormous market growth that’s expected to reach nearly $3.7 trillion by 2034, there’s been an explosion in AI startups across almost every industry sector. With so much buzz and media attention surrounding the biggest firms, it may seem impossible to distinguish your brand from the top players. The competition for funding, market share and media attention is fierce: How can you best share your mission with your target audience without feeling like your efforts are going unnoticed? The key to building a standout AI brand is prioritizing measurable business outcomes and clear KPIs, such as growing audience reach, boosting your sales pipeline, strengthening partnerships or increasing share of voice. A PR strategy tailored to your company’s goals can help you get there. Here’s where to start: Many consumers are skeptical about the “artificial” part of AI and fear machines will take over the world (or at least their jobs). You need to humanize your organization and your brand to build trust and foster connection. Who are you? What are your values? How does your solution make your customers’ lives easier? Because people want to buy from other humans, not company logos, a strong executive brand-building and thought leadership program can give customers a glimpse into the people behind your brand. This is especially critical for AI brands, allowing executives to explain their intentions behind the innovation and address consumer hesitation directly. In addition to an executive social media presence, podcasts are highly effective in fostering authenticity and humanity. The longer, more conversational format lets leaders show their personality and share their own perspectives. Your audience wants to know you understand their pain points and how your solution addresses them. Most consumers aren’t interested in the intricate technical details behind your product, which is what many genius-level founders quickly default to when asked about their solution. A messaging workshop can help you articulate your solution’s value proposition—how it’s better, faster and easier than your competitors’ tools—in a way that won’t make people’s eyes glaze over. Communicate what truly sets you apart, and never rely on being “first” as a differentiator because, in this industry, that distinction won’t last five minutes. Who cares if you’re the first if the second is better? Focus on value and benefit to the customer. Executives often struggle to articulate their brand’s message concisely and consistently. Messaging workshops and media trainings can help them master this skill. A good rule of thumb is, “Can you explain it to my mom and make it relatable?” (Ping me if you want to practice with her!) Trust is the foundation of any successful business. To maintain it, honesty is nonnegotiable. Overpromising and underdelivering can quickly erode audience confidence. One of the biggest mistakes I’ve seen companies such as Tesla and many crypto firms make is hyping up some incredible new breakthrough and then failing to deliver, causing their stock price and brand trust to plummet. Then, there’s the disaster at Meta over AI Facebook and Instagram accounts. This kind of mess harms not only your brand’s image but also consumers’ general perception of AI. The problem is even worse when brands don’t trust their PR team and keep them in the dark about delays or other potential crises until the 11th hour. By then, it’s too late for the team to do proactive damage control. Instead, be upfront, transparent and walk the walk to build trust with customers, partners and the media. If you miss a delivery deadline, give advance notice. If you’re using AI bots, be clear around the intention behind them and you might win favor for the novelty and accuracy of the experience. Don’t wait for the news to break and then sheepishly ask for forgiveness. Repetition and consistency are key to any brand strategy, helping grow recognition and awareness by keeping your people, products or brand in front of your target audience. Speaking engagements and award programs are among the best ways to nurture credibility and trust. Winning an award tells potential customers that your company and products are legit; it’s like a stamp of approval from the experts. Similarly, having your executives speak at events shows them as reliable and reputable industry sources, while also putting a face to your brand. Influencer marketing and analyst relations can be especially valuable for building credibility through third-party validation. These industry experts understand your market, and when analysts communicate your mission and differentiators to their audience, they can significantly influence buyer decisions. While AI may seem like a steep learning curve for many industries and as media channels continue to evolve, the core principles of brand building remain the same. This is no different than the emergence of past innovations: the internet, Big Data, online banking or mobile payments—technologies that once sparked hesitation but are now part of everyday life. You don’t need a PR team that specializes in AI. You need one that understands how to craft the right message, deliver it to the right audience and drive business results. No matter what bright, shiny thing comes along next, a PR strategy rooted in authenticity, clear differentiators, trust and credibility will always stand the test of time. Forbes Agency Council is an invitation-only community for executives in successful public relations, media strategy, creative and advertising agencies. Do I qualify?

Title: Morgan Stanley Research: With $16 Billion In R&D Spending This Year Alone, NVIDIA “Can Maintain A 4–5‑year Development Cycle By Running Three Design Teams Sequentially — Each With An 18–24‑Month Architectural Cadence”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Custom AI-focused ASICs are increasingly being billed as NVIDIA's Achilles heel, capable of bringing down the entire demand-related edifice that NVIDIA has painstakingly built by leveraging its strength in the GPU arena. Yet, Morgan Stanley Research now thinks that ASICs pose no threat to NVIDIA's broader success story. Morgan Stanley: Despite ASICs, Nvidia will continue to maintain a dominant market share. The ASIC category is neither superior nor inferior to commercial GPUs—it is simply another means to achieve the same result. Over the past six months, momentum in the AI sector has clearly… — Jukanlosreve (@Jukanlosreve) February 14, 2025 To wit, Morgan Stanley Research has now penned an exhaustive note on the evolving GPU vs. ASIC paradigm, arguing that NVIDIA faces no material threat to its dominant position in the market. The research arm of the Wall Street titan concedes at the outset that "momentum in the AI sector has clearly shifted toward custom silicon," and so has the market, with NVIDIA currently commanding a ~$3 trillion market capitalization on the back of $32 billion in quarterly revenues, while Broadcom (AVGO) now supports a $1.1 trillion market cap on just $3.2 billion in quarterly revenues. Morgan Stanley Research then notes that the development budget of a given ASIC is generally less than $1 billion, and often much lower. In contrast, NVIDIA spends an insane amount of money to deliver an immaculate product: "... NVIDIA will invest approximately $16 billion in R&D this year alone. With that funding, NVIDIA can maintain a 4–5‑year development cycle by running three design teams sequentially—each with an 18–24‑month architectural cadence—delivering innovation over a five‑year span. In addition, they invest billions in interconnect technologies to boost rack‑scale and cluster‑scale performance..." Of course, custom ASIC's such as Google's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) are much more customizable. However, Morgan Stanley argues that the "largest AI training and inference clusters are not currently highly customized," and NVIDIA continues to optimize its GPUs for transformer models. Going forward, Morgan Stanley thinks that the greatest utility for highly customized ASICs will lie in "legacy workloads." Yet, some might argue that the cost factor is the biggest draw for customized ASICs, which can cost as little as $3,000 while NVIDIA's H100 is priced at $20,000. Here though, Morgan Stanley argues that there are hidden costs that should be taken into account. For instance, the cluster cost for ASICs is often materially higher as they employ the much more expensive optical connect technology, while NVIDIA's 72‑GPU NVLINK domain leverages the much cheaper copper-based technology. Moreover, with its unmatched buying power, NVIDIA can easily secure preferential rates for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips. The Wall Street titan goes on to note: "The same applies to CoWoS; because many ASICs use smaller dies with larger stacks, the CoWoS cost can be higher than that of NVIDIA. Of course, NVIDIA’s wafer costs might be higher due to reticle‑limited dies, but overall, Nvidia delivers exceptional value." Next, Morgan Stanley argues that 'software developer hours' should also be incorporated in the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for ASICs, where NVIDIA's CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) SDK is at a distinct advantage and provides for a much more efficient software development experience. Morgan Stanley then goes on to assert that "NVIDIA and AMD will outperform ASIC competitors [this year] — especially in the second half of the year." "The scale of AMD’s investments across the ecosystem tends to far exceed that of ASIC vendors. This year, AMD has completed two acquisitions of AI software assets. One of these—the acquisition of ZT Systems—involved acquiring a major server ODM, divesting the ODM business while retaining key engineering talent related to rack‑ and cluster‑scale computing. Once in possession of such assets, AMD can deploy them across multiple cloud environments, which drives third‑party support and accelerates ecosystem development. Can ASIC designers within the cloud replicate this?" Next, Morgan Stanley Research notes that in 2024, commercial silicon controlled 90 percent of the market, led by NVIDIA's $98 billion in chip-based revenue (on a provisional basis since the GPU manufacturer has yet to announce its earnings for the last quarter) and trailed by AMD at $5 billion. In contrast, custom ASICs controlled only 10 percent of the market in 2024, led by Broadcom with $8 billion in revenue, and trailed by Alchip and Marvel whose combined revenue amounted to only ~$2 billion. In what is a critical prediction, Morgan Stanley then declares: "We expect the 90% share for commercial products to increase slightly this year." To bolster this prediction, the Wall Street behemoth notes that Broadcom is overly reliant on Google's TPU to drive sales. Yet, in 2025, NVIDIA "will grow 50 – 100% more than TPU." Similarly, Marvel is increasingly reliant on Amazon's Trainium ASIC. While Amazon is all set to double its ASIC purchases to ~$4 billion this year, it is also expected to "more than double" its purchases from NVIDIA. Therefore, Morgan Stanley thinks that NVIDIA's "revenue momentum in the second half [of 2025] will be significantly stronger than the builds from ASIC or AMD." Beyond 2026, ASIC growth can explode, with Broadcom's own SAM analysis predicting that "Google, Meta, and Bytedance could each achieve between $60 billion and $90 billion in revenue in the 2027 fiscal year with clusters numbering in the millions." Nonetheless, Morgan Stanley thinks that "the total addressable market (TAM) for AI ASICs would grow from $12 billion in 2024 to $30 billion in 2027—a figure considerably lower than what is being discounted in the market now." Towards the end, the investment bank notes: "NVIDIA's biggest short‑term risk is U.S. export controls, which are equally problematic for AVGO. In the long term, the greatest risk is not competition but a slowdown in investment— which we forecast to occur around mid‑2026." Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: Markets Shrug Off More Tariff Talk; Meta Platforms Improbable Run

Shares of DraftKings are indicated higher in premarket following a bullish outlook issued by the ... [+] company. (Photo illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images) Key Takeaways Stocks posted their best day of the week on Thursday. The S&P 500, Russell 2000 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all posted gains of right around 1%. Meantime, the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.5%. The run came despite a higher-than-expected uptick in the Core Producer Price Index (PPI) and more tariff talk. Concerns about inflation began heating up on Wednesday following a Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showing prices ticking higher. Yesterday's PPI confirmed inflation was moving higher but perhaps not to the extend many feared from the CPI read. Still, the reports have put inflation back on the table and that will likely result in added emphasis placed on both future economic data and what members of the Fed say at any speaking engagement. I think next Wednesday, when the Fed releases the minutes from their last meeting, there will be a lot of tea leaves reading. Tangentially related to inflation, on Thursday, President Trump said he plans to put in place reciprocal tariffs on countries that have tariffs on U.S. goods. That threat is being seen as taking aim at India and the European Union among others. The specifics of the tariffs are not yet known but are expected to be announced next Tuesday. One of the things we’ve seen since the new administration took over is a return to policy by tweet. What I mean by that is simply, President Trump often makes announcements via social media and will do so without forewarning. That has sometimes meant policy announcements over the weekend and investors may want to be more conscience of that risk on Fridays. Turning to earnings, after the close on Thursday both Coinbase and DraftKings announced results. For Coinbase, it was the strongest quarter for revenue in three years as the company beat on both the top and bottom lines. Shares of Coinbase were up 8% on Thursday but are indicated to open down just under 1%. DraftKings also reported their results. While the online betting company missed on both the top and bottom lines, they did report a 36% increase in monthly unique payers for the quarter. They also raised their guidance for 2025. Shares of DraftKings were up 2% Thursday and are trading higher by 5% in premarket. Finally, Applied Materials released their earnings this morning. While the company beat on both the top and bottom line, they offered an outlook below what analysts expected. Shares of Applied Materials are lower by nearly 10% in premarket trading. One stock that did not report earnings but has been on an incredible run of late is Meta Platforms. That company has seen its shares rise for seventeen consecutive days. The probability of this happening for those that are curious is 0.0000076. If you are someone who has enjoyed the ride and decided you might want to take profits or at least protect them, I don't think anyone would blame you in light of the probability of what has been happening. For today, I am keeping an eye on Meta Platforms for the reason I mentioned above. I'm also watching gold. Despite the strength in the market and its ability to seemingly shrug off anything, gold is trading at all-time highs and that may serve as the proverbial canary in the coal mine with respect to a reemergence of inflation and what it could mean for equities. This is also a three-day weekend with Monday being President's Day and therefore, because of the nature in which policy decisions are being announced, I would not be surprised if we see some selling near the close today. I also wouldn't be surprised if, while watching television this weekend, we see a ton of commercials for mattress sales because somewhere along the line, we decided it can't be an American holiday without mattresses going on sale. As always, I would stick with your investing plan and long-term objectives. tastytrade, Inc. commentary for educational purposes only.

Starting is simple – click on your state now and take the first step toward a more secure financial future! Look, if you’re investing in gold, you’re doing it because you understand one fundamental truth: paper money is a joke. The government prints it like Monopoly cash, inflation robs you blind, and the banking system? A house of cards waiting to collapse. You want something real, something tangible—gold. Bullion is just a fancy word for gold bars and coins, and this is where serious investors park their money. Why? Because bullion holds its value when everything else crumbles. What’s the catch? Great, you’ve got some gold. Now what? You can’t just stuff it in a sock drawer and hope for the best. Step one: don’t be an idiot. There are a lot of scammers out there preying on people who don’t do their research. You don’t just sit on gold forever. At some point, you’ll want to cash out. Gold ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are basically the participation trophy of gold investing. You don’t actually own gold—you own a paper representation of gold. It’s like saying you have a pet lion because you watched a National Geographic documentary. But hey, some people don’t want to deal with safes, security, or actually holding real gold. If that’s you, then ETFs are the easiest way to get in on the gold game. A Gold ETF is a fund that tracks the price of gold. You buy shares, and those shares are supposed to represent actual gold that some financial institution (probably one you don’t trust) is holding in a vault somewhere. The most popular ones: The idea is simple: Instead of buying and storing gold yourself, you buy shares in a fund that does it for you. Sounds great, right? Well… not so fast. ✅ Easy to Buy & Sell – Unlike physical gold, you can trade ETFs instantly on the stock market. No haggling with dealers. No waiting for delivery. Just click and you own (sort of) gold.✅ No Storage Hassles – No safes, no vaults, no worrying about someone breaking into your house and making off with your stash.✅ Lower Transaction Costs – No dealer markups, no shipping fees, no getting ripped off by pawn shops when you sell.✅ Can Be Held in an IRA – If you want to hedge your retirement savings with gold, ETFs are an easy way to do it inside a tax-advantaged account. So yeah, ETFs give you exposure to gold without the headaches. But now let’s talk about the ugly side of ETFs—because there’s plenty. 🚩 You Don’t Actually Own Gold – Let’s be crystal clear: Owning a Gold ETF is not the same as owning physical gold. If the system collapses, you’re holding a digital number on a screen, not something you can barter with. If you don’t hold it, you don’t own it. Period. 🚩 Counterparty Risk – When you own gold in your hands, you don’t have to trust anyone. With an ETF, you’re trusting banks, fund managers, and custodians—aka, the same people who mismanage money, rig markets, and gamble with your savings. If something goes wrong, guess who gets left holding the bag? (Hint: It’s not them.) 🚩 Redemption Is a Joke – Most Gold ETFs do not let you redeem your shares for actual gold. That means even if the fund does hold physical gold (which you’re just taking their word for), you’ll never see a single ounce of it. Instead, when you sell, you get paid in cash—which, again, is just paper money. 🚩 Fees Eat Into Your Gains – GLD charges an expense ratio of about 0.40% per year. Doesn’t sound like much, but over time, that adds up. And unlike physical gold, which just sits there gaining value, ETFs bleed a little money every year just for existing. 🚩 Government Control – Here’s a fun fact: The government can freeze your brokerage account anytime it wants. Think it can’t happen? Ask the Canadians who had their bank accounts locked for donating to the trucker protests. If things get bad enough, your Gold ETF won’t save you. Look, I’ll be fair—Gold ETFs aren’t useless. They’re a decent option if you:✅ Just want short-term exposure to gold prices without dealing with physical storage.✅ Are a trader looking to capitalize on gold price movements.✅ Want a gold hedge inside your stock portfolio. But if you’re investing in gold because you actually care about protecting wealth, hedging against collapse, or securing your financial future, physical gold is the only real option. Gold mutual funds are bundles of investments related to gold, usually a mix of mining stocks, gold ETFs, and sometimes actual gold bullion. You put your money in, and some fund manager—who takes a cut, by the way—decides how to invest it for you. Examples: Why do people buy these? But Here’s the Problem: 🚩 You Don’t Own Gold – Again, you own paper assets linked to gold. When the system breaks down, what good is a mutual fund statement? 🚩 Fees & Middlemen – The fund manager gets paid whether you make money or not. If gold skyrockets, they profit first. 🚩 Stock Market Exposure – These funds are tied to mining companies, which means they rise and fall with the stock market, not just gold prices. If the economy tanks, mining stocks can crash even if gold goes up. 🚩 Government Regulation – The SEC, the IRS, and every other three-letter agency has their hands all over these. If things go south, mutual funds can be frozen, taxed, or “restructured” (a nice way of saying you get screwed). Now, if gold mutual funds are for passive investors, gold futures are for the adrenaline junkies who think betting their savings on short-term gold prices is a good idea. A gold futures contract is a legal agreement to buy or sell gold at a future date at a set price. You don’t have to own gold—you’re just betting on whether the price will go up or down. ✅ Leverage – You control a large amount of gold with a small amount of money.✅ Short-Term Profits – If you time it right, you can make a lot of money fast.✅ Liquidity – Futures are heavily traded, so you can buy and sell quickly. Why Gold Futures Are Insane for Most People: 🚩 Extreme Risk – Gold futures are a zero-sum game. If you win, someone else loses. If you lose, you lose big. Most retail traders get wiped out. 🚩 Margin Calls – If the market moves against you, you have to put up more money. Fast. If you can’t, your position is liquidated, and you’re left with nothing. 🚩 No Physical Gold – Once again, this is just numbers on a screen. If the financial system collapses, do you really think your futures contract is going to protect you? 🚩 Big Players Control the Market – Hedge funds, banks, and institutions dominate the futures market. They have insider knowledge, algorithms, and the ability to manipulate prices. You don’t. If you’re investing in gold because you want real security, neither of these options should be your first choice. Gold Mutual Funds and Gold Futures are just Wall Street’s way of keeping you trapped in their system—where they get their fees and take their cut, while you hold an IOU for gold that you’ll never see. Real gold? That’s what kings, governments, and smart people hold.Paper gold? That’s what they sell to the masses. So ask yourself: Do you want to own gold, or do you want to play Wall Street’s gold games? Alright, let’s talk about Gold IRAs—because if you’re planning for retirement and you don’t have some of your money in gold, you’re doing it wrong. Here’s the reality: The U.S. dollar is a ticking time bomb. The government prints money like a drunk teenager with a credit card, inflation is eating away at your savings, and politicians—both parties—have no interest in fixing the mess. So, what do you do? You put your retirement savings into something that actually holds value. And that’s exactly what a Gold IRA does. A Gold IRA (Individual Retirement Account) is a self-directed IRA that lets you hold physical gold instead of just stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Instead of trusting Wall Street with your future, you invest in something real—gold, silver, and other precious metals. You’re still getting the tax advantages of a regular IRA, but instead of hoping your stocks don’t crash right before retirement, you own actual gold that holds value no matter what happens. ✅ Hedges Against Inflation – While your dollars become worthless, gold keeps its purchasing power. 50 years ago, $35 bought you an ounce of gold. Today, that same ounce is worth nearly $2,000+. That’s how you keep wealth intact. ✅ Protects You from Government Stupidity – If the economy crashes, if banks fail, if another bailout happens (and it will), your 401(k) full of stocks could get wrecked. A Gold IRA keeps your savings in a real asset that politicians can’t just print more of. ✅ Tax-Advantaged Growth – Just like a traditional IRA, you can defer taxes on your gains. With a Roth Gold IRA, you pay taxes now but never again—so when gold skyrockets, your profits are 100% tax-free. ✅ Diversification That Actually Works – Wall Street tells you to “diversify” by buying 30 different stocks… all of which can crash at the same time. Real diversification means owning something outside of the stock market—like gold. ✅ You Own It, Not Some Bank – Unlike Gold ETFs or mining stocks, where you’re trusting paper contracts, a Gold IRA holds physical, tangible gold stored in a secure, IRS-approved depository. It’s yours. No counterparty risk, no Wall Street nonsense. It’s actually easier than you think—and if you already have a 401(k) or IRA, you can roll it over into gold. 1️⃣ Find a Gold IRA Custodian – You need an IRS-approved company to handle the paperwork and store your gold. Good options include: 2️⃣ Fund Your Account – You can roll over an existing IRA or 401(k) tax-free or make new contributions (subject to IRS limits). 3️⃣ Buy Approved Gold & Silver – Not just any gold works—IRS rules say you need to buy specific coins and bars, like: 4️⃣ Secure Storage – The gold is stored in a highly secure, IRS-approved depository. No, you can’t keep it under your mattress (IRS rules), but it’s your gold, sitting in a vault, completely safe. 5️⃣ Watch It Grow – Gold doesn’t pay dividends, but it appreciates in value while the dollar dies. And when you retire? You can either take a cash payout or have the gold shipped directly to you. 🚩 “Gold IRAs have storage and custodian fees!” ▶ Yeah, and so does a regular IRA or 401(k)—you just don’t see the hidden fees you’re paying to Wall Street. At least with a Gold IRA, you’re paying to store something real instead of gambling on stocks. 🚩 “Gold doesn’t generate income like stocks.” ▶ Gold’s job isn’t to pay dividends—it’s to preserve wealth. Stocks rise and fall, but gold holds its value for centuries. 🚩 “What if the government confiscates gold like in 1933?” ▶ If that happens, trust me, the economy is so far gone that nothing will be safe. But Gold IRAs are still a smarter bet than hoping Wall Street takes care of you. Alright, let’s get something straight right now—if you don’t hold the gold in your hands, you don’t own it. Period. End of discussion. And yet, we’ve got this new trend—Digital Gold. It sounds fancy. It sounds modern. But let’s call it what it really is: a digital IOU for gold that you’ll probably never see. Let’s break this down. Digital Gold is a system where you buy fractional ownership of gold stored in a vault somewhere—but instead of getting the actual gold, you get a digital certificate or balance that says you “own” it. Popular platforms include: The idea is simple: Instead of dealing with the “hassle” of storing real gold, you just trust some company to hold it for you while they give you a number on a screen. Sounds familiar? Yeah, that’s because it’s basically a glorified bank account. ✅ Fractional Ownership – You can buy tiny amounts of gold, even a few dollars’ worth, which makes it accessible. ✅ No Storage Hassle – You don’t need a safe, a vault, or a hidden compartment in your house. The gold is “securely stored” for you (so they say). ✅ Fast Transactions – You can buy and sell instantly, unlike physical gold, which takes time to sell and ship. ✅ Can Be Used for Payments – Some digital gold platforms even let you “spend” your gold like cash. Because apparently, gold is too “old-fashioned” now. Alright, sounds nice, right? Yeah, until you realize the entire thing is built on trust. 🚩 YOU DON’T ACTUALLY OWN THE GOLD – Let’s get one thing clear: Digital Gold is not the same as holding physical gold. You’re trusting some company to store it for you, and if they go bankrupt, get hacked, or decide to freeze your account, good luck getting your gold. 🚩 COUNTERPARTY RISK – When you own real gold, you don’t have to trust anyone. When you own digital gold, you’re trusting a company, a vault, and a bunch of middlemen to not screw you over. And if history has taught us anything, middlemen always screw you over. 🚩 WITHDRAWAL RESTRICTIONS – Many digital gold platforms make it incredibly difficult to actually take physical delivery of your gold. There are minimum withdrawal amounts, high fees, and long wait times. In other words, they’ll sell you “gold” all day long, but when you ask for the real thing? Suddenly, there are rules. 🚩 GOVERNMENT CONTROL – What’s stopping the government from regulating or seizing digital gold platforms? Nothing. Your account can be frozen, your assets can be taxed, and suddenly, your “gold-backed” investment isn’t so secure anymore. 🚩 CENTRALIZATION DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF GOLD – The whole point of gold is freedom from the financial system. Digital Gold just locks you back into it. It’s basically a digital fiat currency dressed up as gold. Let’s be real—if the economy crashes tomorrow, Digital Gold is just another number on a screen. You know what people will actually trade? Real, physical gold. Look, I get it. Digital Gold sounds convenient. It’s easy, it’s fast, and it feels like “owning gold” without the “hassle.” But that’s exactly the trap. The whole reason you invest in gold is to get out of the system—not to get trapped in another version of it. If you want to actually protect your wealth, here’s what you do:🚨 BUY REAL GOLD. 🚨 STORE IT YOURSELF. 🚨 DON’T TRUST THIRD PARTIES. It’s that simple. Don’t fall for the Digital Gold illusion. Because when things go south, the only gold that matters is the gold in your hands. If you have zero faith in the U.S. government, the Federal Reserve, or the financial system, congratulations—you’re paying attention. A Gold IRA is one of the smartest ways to protect your retirement from inflation, stock market crashes, and the reckless policies that are destroying the dollar. Gold is real. Gold is lasting. Gold is what nations, billionaires, and smart people invest in when they see economic chaos coming. So the only question left is: Are you protecting your future, or are you gambling it on a system that’s already failing?

CANADA - 2025/02/09: In this photo illustration, the Cisco Systems logo is seen displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Note: Cisco’s fiscal year 2024 ended on July 27, 2024. Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO), a company specializing in networking equipment, security, collaboration, and cloud management services, has seen its stock rise 6% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 index’s 3% growth as of January 12. In contrast, CSCO’s competitor, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), experienced a 3% decline in the same period. Separately, check out: HubSpot Stock At $840 – Is the Price Justified? Cisco’s Q2 earnings for the period ending January 25, released on February 12, surpassed analyst expectations on both revenue and profit. The company reported $14 billion in revenue, marking a 9% year-over-year (y-o-y) increase. This performance ended a four-quarter streak of revenue declines, with growth largely driven by a surge in AI infrastructure orders, which amounted to over $350 million during the quarter. Despite this revenue boost, net income fell 8% y-o-y to $2.43 billion, or $0.61 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS increased by 8% to $0.94. Looking ahead, Cisco raised its full-year revenue outlook to a range of $56 billion to $56.5 billion, up from its previous estimate of $55.3 billion to $56.3 billion. The company also increased its adjusted earnings per share forecast to between $3.68 and $3.74, compared to its earlier projection of $3.60 to $3.66. If you are looking for a portfolio with steady gains rather than investing in an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, generating > 91% returns since its inception. Cisco’s fiscal first half saw mixed results, with security revenue doubling y-o-y, while networking revenue dropped by 14%. While product revenue remained stable, service revenue grew by 6% y-o-y, underscoring the industry's shift towards service-based solutions. In March 2024, Cisco completed its $27 billion acquisition of Splunk, a move aimed at strengthening its security offerings. This acquisition aligns with Cisco's strategy to enhance its AI-powered threat detection and response capabilities. Splunk has already contributed positively to Cisco’s revenue; without it, Cisco’s total revenue would have declined by 1% y-o-y. Additionally, Splunk has boosted Cisco's adjusted EPS ahead of expectations. Its AI-driven software, which helps companies analyze log files and manage cybersecurity risks, will be cross-sold to around 5,000 existing Cisco customers identified as potential users. Cisco has also improved its gross margins in recent quarters, benefiting from lower freight and component costs, a more favorable product mix, and overall cost efficiencies. On a GAAP basis, Cisco’s total gross margin, product gross margin, and services gross margin stood at 65.1%, 63.7%, and 68.9%, respectively, compared to 64.2%, 62.7%, and 68.2% in Q2 of fiscal 2024. Similar trends may continue in Q3. The company has also been shifting towards a recurring revenue model through software subscriptions and service contracts, which could further support margins. CSCO stock has experienced volatile returns over the past four years, with performance varying significantly from year to year. It delivered a 46% gain in 2021, a 22% decline in 2022, a 9% increase in 2023, and a 22% gain in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, has exhibited much lower volatility while consistently outperforming the S&P 500. What sets it apart? This portfolio has delivered superior returns with reduced risk, offering a smoother ride than individual stock investments. You can see the difference in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. We have revised our Cisco Valuation to $65 per share, based on an expected EPS of $3.70 and a P/E multiple of 17.6x for fiscal 2025. However, this valuation is roughly in line with the current market price as of January 12. You can also explore our detailed Cisco Revenue analysis for a closer look at its key revenue sources.

Title: Jeff Bezos-Backed Space Company Blue Origin To Lay Off 10% Workforce

Jeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin LLC is cutting about 10% of its workforce, a significant pullback aimed at slashing costs and refocusing resources after years of development work. The rocket and engine maker laid out the personnel shakeup during an all-hands employee meeting with Chief Executive Officer Dave Limp Thursday morning, confirming a workforce reduction first reported by Bloomberg. In a memo sent to employees, Limp said the company's growth led to "more bureaucracy and less focus" than needed after a hiring spree over the past few years. After years of expansion bankrolled by Bezos, who started Amazon.com Inc. and is the world's third-richest person, Blue Origin is looking to trim manager ranks as it works to clear some $10 billion worth of launch contracts. With a staff of more than 10,000, the layoffs stand to impact over 1,000 roles. Blue Origin is eliminating positions in engineering, research and development, and project management, as well as "thinning out our layers of management," Limp wrote in the email, which was viewed by Bloomberg. The surprise round of layoffs comes about a month after Blue Origin debuted its flagship New Glenn rocket following years of delays and development setbacks. Bezos founded Blue Origin in 2000. Since then, the company's payroll has gone as high as roughly 14,000 employees spread across its headquarters in the Seattle area and sprawling manufacturing and launch operations sites in Florida, Texas and Alabama. Blue Origin maintains an ambitious space portfolio that includes space tourism, a moon lander, space station and supplying rocket engines. Blue Origin has drawn unfavorable comparisons to Elon Musk's SpaceX, which leapfrogged many startups over the past quarter century to become the world's most prolific rocket launcher. Limp, an ex-Amazon leader, was hired in 2023 to help shake the company out of a years-long R&D slump. Limp added that the company is looking to the future, including landing an uncrewed vehicle on the moon in 2025 and increasing the cadence of New Glenn and New Shepard launches.

Title: Dating App Cover-Up: How Tinder, Hinge, and Their Corporate Owner Keep Rape Under Wraps – The Markup

Challenging technology to serve the public good. The company behind more than a dozen dating apps, Match Group, has known for years about the abusive users on its platforms, but chooses to leave millions of people in the dark By Emily Elena Dugdale and Hanisha Harjani The Dating Apps Reporting Project is an 18-month investigation. It was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center’s AI Accountability Network and The Markup, now a part of CalMatters, and copublished with The Guardian and The 19th. When a young woman in Denver met up with a smiling cardiologist she matched with on the dating app Hinge, she had no way of knowing that the company behind the app had already received reports from two other women who accused him of rape. She met the 34-year-old doctor with green eyes and thinning hair at Highland Tap & Burger, a sports bar in a trendy neighborhood. It went well enough that she accepted an invitation to go back to his apartment. As she emerged from his bathroom, he handed her a tequila soda. What transpired over the next 24 hours, according to court testimony, reads like every person’s dating app nightmare. After sipping the drink, the woman started to lose control. Her memory blurred. She fell to the ground, and the man started to film her. He put her in a headlock, kissing her forehead; she struggled to free herself but managed to grab her things and leave. He followed her out the door, holding her shoes and trying to force her back inside, but she was able to call an Uber, vomiting in the car on the way home. Because it turns out moving fast and breaking things broke some super important things. Because it turns out moving fast and breaking things broke some super important things. She woke up at home, soaking wet on her bathroom floor, the key to her house still in her door. She continued vomiting for hours. When she came to, she reported the assault to Hinge. Hinge is one of more than a dozen dating apps owned by Match Group. The $8.5 billion global conglomerate also owns brands like Tinder (the world’s most popular dating app), OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish. Match Group controls half of the world’s online dating market, operates in 190 countries, and facilitates meetups for millions of people. Match Group’s official safety policy states that when a user is reported for assault, “all accounts found that are associated with that user will be banned from our platforms.” So why, on the night of Jan. 25, 2023, was Stephen Matthews still on the app? Just four days before, Match Group had been alerted when another woman reported him for rape. A little more than a week later, he was reported for rape again. This time, the survivor went to the police. None of these women knew that the company had known about his violent behavior for years. He was first reported on Sept. 28, 2020. By then, Match Group’s safety policy was already in place. Even after a police report, it took nearly two months for Matthews to be arrested — the only thing that got him off the apps. By then, at least 15 women would eventually report that Matthews had raped or drugged them. Nearly every one of them had met him on dating apps run by Match Group. On Oct. 25, 2024, a Denver judge sentenced Matthews to 158 years to life in prison after a jury convicted him of 35 counts related to drugging and sexually assaulting eight women, drugging two women, and assaulting one more for a total of 11 women. Attorneys for the women said much of that violence could have been prevented. “It is shocking that for years after receiving reports of sexual assault, Hinge continued to allow Stephen Matthews access to its platforms and actively facilitated his abuse,” said Laura Wolf, the attorney representing the woman whose police report led to the arrest. Following best practices for reporting on sexual assault, the Dating Apps Reporting Project is honoring survivors’ requests for anonymity. Matthews’ attorney, Douglas Cohen, declined to comment. A letter that The Dating Apps Reporting Project sent directly to Matthews in jail went unanswered. Match Group’s reach is so massive — its mission is “to spark meaningful connections for every single person worldwide” — that people are more likely to meet through its apps than out at the bars, at church, or through friends. But Matthews’ case shows that even as these apps have made it easier for us to connect with a seemingly endless pool of potential lovers, they have also made it easier for people who commit sexual abuse to reach a seemingly endless number of potential targets. In 2022, a team of researchers at Brigham Young University published an analysis of hundreds of sexual assaults in Utah. They found attacks facilitated by dating apps happened faster and were more violent than when the perpetrator met the victim through other means. They also found that perpetrators who use dating apps are more likely to target vulnerable people. Almost 60 percent of sexual assault survivors self-reported a mental illness. Match Group has known for years which users have been reported for drugging, assaulting, or raping their dates since at least 2016, according to internal company documents. Since 2019, Match Group’s central database has recorded every user reported for rape and assault across its entire suite of apps; by 2022, the system, known as Sentinel, was collecting hundreds of troubling incidents every week, company insiders say. Match Group promised in 2020 that it would release what’s known as a transparency report — a public document that would reveal data on harm occurring on and off its platforms. If the public were aware of the scale of rape and assault on Match Group apps, they would be able to accurately assess their risk. As of February 2025, the report has not been released. Instead, as people continued to get hurt, the company dithered over what damning information should be hidden. “Do we only publish where we are required by law?” reads a slide in a 2021 presentation shown multiple times to Match Group employees as well as external safety partners. “Do we push back on how much we are required to reveal, or do we try to go beyond what is required?” No online space is risk-free. But while Match Group has long possessed the tools, financial resources, and investigative procedures necessary to make it harder for bad actors to resurface, internal documents show the company has resisted efforts to spread them across its apps, in part because safety protocols could stall corporate growth. “The obsession with metrics and having to stick with them is frustrating and potentially dangerous,” one employee wrote in 2021 after the company learned that the investigative news nonprofit ProPublica was planning a story. “This is not the way we were meant to work and people’s lives are at risk.” The same person asked their superiors: “‘How much would you personally pay to stop just one person being sexually assaulted by a date, one child being trafficked or one vulnerable person being driven to suicide by a predator?’ I feel that if I asked members of our staff that question individually, they would put a high value of their own money on it – But as a group nobody is ready to hear that yet.” Since 2021, Match Group has publicly promised to improve the safety of their products and share data, but company insiders say safety has not improved. A brief hiring spree sparked by congressional and media scrutiny has been largely scaled back, according to former employees. In 2024, the remaining employees from the central trust-and-safety team Match Group set up in response to increased scrutiny were let go and their jobs outsourced to overseas contractors. Facing pressure from Wall Street, Match Group removed CEO Bernard Kim in early February 2025 as he struggled to cut costs and end the steady decline in subscribers to Match Group’s most powerful app, Tinder. Members of Congress have repeatedly requested data from Match Group on sexual harm. In February 2020, 11 members of Congress wrote to then-CEO Shar Dubey asking for details on how the company responds to reports of sexual violence. In July 2023, two Democrats, then-Rep. Annie Kuster of New Hampshire and Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois followed up after we inquired on the status of their efforts. The company has still not provided the data. In September 2024, the House of Representatives passed a bill that requires consumers to be notified if they have interacted with a user on a dating app who has been banned for defrauding consumers of money or personal financial information. But the bill stopped short of addressing the issue of sexual assault on the apps, and it died in the Senate. Our review of hundreds of pages of internal company documents, along with thousands of pages of court records, securities filings, and analyst reports, coupled with dozens of interviews with current and former employees and survivors of sexual violence found women who report being raped get no traction, while accused rapists like Stephen Matthews keep swiping — and assaulting. Our own testing on Match Group apps shows that as of February 2025, not much has changed. Banned Tinder users, including those reported for sexual assault, can easily rejoin or move to another Match Group dating app, all while keeping most of their key personal information exactly the same. The Dating Apps Reporting Project sent Match Group a four-page letter detailing our findings. The company responded with a short statement. The statement did not dispute that Match Group has carefully documented the extent of harm on company apps for years without sharing that information with the public. It also defended the company’s efforts to make platforms safe. “We recognize our role in fostering safer communities and promoting authentic and respectful connections worldwide,” the statement provided by Kayla Whaling, senior director of communications, read. “We will always work to invest in and improve our systems, and search for ways to help our users stay safe, both online and when they connect in real life.” The company said it vigorously combats violence. “We take every report of misconduct seriously, and vigilantly remove and block accounts that have violated our rules regarding this behavior,” its statement read. Our own testing found otherwise. Starting in April 2024, The Dating Apps Reporting Project created a series of Tinder accounts that we subsequently reported for sexual assault. Soon after, Tinder banned the accounts, and we started investigating how easy it would be for a banned user to create new accounts. Repeatedly, we found that users, soon after being banned, could create new Tinder accounts with the exact same name, birthday, and profile photos used on their banned accounts. Users banned from Tinder were also able to sign up for Hinge, OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish without changing those personal details. To get around the Tinder ban, we used techniques commonly suggested by online guides and forums that don’t require lots of technical knowledge to understand. We were able to verify three techniques that allowed banned Match Group users to repeatedly bypass being flagged when creating new accounts. In its statement, Match Group cast itself as an industry leader in deploying technology to promote safety, including “harassment-preventing AI tools, ID verification for profiles, and a portal that helps us better support and communicate with law enforcement investigating crimes. … Every person deserves safe and respectful experiences. We are committed to doing the work to make dating safer on our platforms and beyond,” the statement said. Sept. 28, 2020 — the date Denver cardiologist Stephen Matthews raped a woman who reported him to Hinge — is also the date Tracey Breeden was brought on as Match Group’s head of safety and social advocacy. Breeden was a flashy hire. “With Tracey coming on board, we are reaffirming our commitment not just to be safety leaders in the dating space, but across the entire tech sector,” then-CEO Shar Dubey said. Sporting a trademark black leather jacket and short, slick-backed hair, Breeden went by the nickname “Tornado” during her 15-year career in law enforcement. What made her attractive to Match Group was her most recent job at Uber. She helped the global ride-hailing company revive its reputation after a series of scandals — from persistent reports of harassment of women employees to allegations that it was ignoring sexual assault that occurred during Uber rides. Working for an Algorithm An investigation by The Markup found that Uber is slow to respond to law enforcement requests, leaving drivers vulnerable to repeated attacks Breeden spearheaded a safety report in 2019 that told the public what Uber knew about nearly every problem, including nationwide reports of intoxicated drivers, traffic fatalities, and incidents of sexual violence. The report became a key metric of success for the company. In hiring Breeden, Match Group hoped to replicate this success across its portfolio of apps. “Corporations,” she said in a press release announcing her arrival, “have a responsibility to help ensure safe experiences for their users.” Breeden’s team garnered public attention for its new safety measures, including partnerships with NGOs, optional AI-assisted photo verification, and a law enforcement portal where police and prosecutors can request data. She also fostered a partnership with Garbo, a startup that offered low-cost background checks. It launched on Tinder in 2022. Experts point out that background checks are not always reliable as they pull from outdated databases, and research suggests that most people who commit sexual abuse do not encounter the criminal justice system. For example, Matthews had no criminal record. During this time, Match Group invested $100 million into safety as a recurring cost, the company said, and boasted about Breeden’s “central safety team.” Her team of veteran safety professionals referred to themselves as “The Avengers,” even donning superhero costumes at company events. But Michael Lawrie called this “safety theater.” Lawrie worked for Match Group for nearly a decade, shaping and leading a safety team for one of the company’s smaller brands, OkCupid. Sometimes working 80-hour weeks, he spent hours, even days, sniffing out savvy users who tried to thwart bans by creating multiple accounts. Over a 30-year career in content moderation, Lawrie said, he saw many users like Stephen Matthews. “You’re dealing with one repeat offender. I’ve dealt with god knows how many repeat offenders,” he said. A yellow Post-it note on the side of Lawrie’s computer listed out some of his responsibilities: “Rape flags. … Investigate miscreants.” These days, Lawrie is trying to start an advocacy organization for content moderators and other front-line safety workers. But, he said, he’s done with dating apps. “I don’t think they’re safe enough at the moment,” he said. “They’re gonna get worse. …I’m hoping dating sites vanish.” Lawrie said he was initially excited about Breeden’s hire. He said she spent her first few months on the job talking to each brand’s safety team, and told him that she was “very impressed” by the work OkCupid was doing. Each of Match Group’s biggest apps provided their self-described strengths and weaknesses to Breeden’s team, according to an internal spreadsheet. At Hinge, these weaknesses included a “very rudimentary warning system with no targeted comms and no follow through” and “no way to find” the original profile “of a bad actor who has created multiple profiles.” Breeden was confronted with an existential problem. “Our current ban categories won’t allow us to answer the public’s biggest question: Am I likely to be harmed on my date?” reads a slide in a presentation drafted by her team in April 2021. While each of Match Group’s apps had a system of reporting and banning violent users, the information was disorganized, and none of the apps talked to each other. Lawrie hoped Breeden would improve safety at the company. But he quickly grew frustrated that neither she nor Match Group leadership listened to his pleas for what they really needed to make platforms safer: To hire trained — and expensive — investigators and integrate powerful moderation tools across all the apps. OkCupid already had those tools. Lawrie was using them every day.One of those was the Sentinel system, which had been up and running across Match Group’s apps for at least five years before Breeden arrived. It works like this: When a user is banned for something serious — like sexual assault — a case is created in Sentinel with the phone number and email address associated with their account. In interviews, multiple current and former employees described how those reports circulate through each of Match Group’s apps. The system is designed to ban anyone who uses that information. It also grabs the original profile’s IP addresses, photos, and birthdate. Such a system seems robust at first glance — but none of the Match Group’s apps require users to provide photo identification (the kind needed to buy alcohol or board an airplane), so once a person is kicked out, they can easily start a new account with different contact information. A quick search yields scores of online forums with clear steps and suggestions for how to rejoin the apps. In addition, internal company documents show information on IP addresses, photos, and birthdate were not used to ban a user if they appear on another Match dating app. Lawrie’s team at OkCupid knew Sentinel could only do so much. So his team deployed other tools to fix its shortcomings, including one that could automatically ban a profile that was linked to a phone number, photo, or URL that had been previously banned — even if the user made an account with a different email or IP address. This tool was designed to be proactive rather than reactive, so that the profiles of alleged perpetrators like Matthews would not resurface after they had been reported. Internal company documents from 2019 and 2020 show thousands of reports of “serious physical assault,” abuse, or violence on OkCupid that were deemed serious enough to get users banned from all of Match Group’s apps. This is among the information the company kept from the public. Breeden and Match Group leadership praised Lawrie and his team at OkCupid, he said, for their thorough investigative work and for handling some of the company’s most difficult cases. Yet, he said, Match Group never built out a skilled, experienced investigative unit at other brands like the one he headed up at OkCupid. Under Breeden’s leadership, he said, they faced pressure to speed up investigations and train outsourced labor to use complicated moderation tools. A week after a damning article in 2021 revealed that content moderators with little training were asked to rapidly deal with violent sexual content across Match Group’s brands, then-CEO Dubey sent out an all-staff email addressing the controversy. She CC’d Breeden, acknowledging that the brand’s safety teams were not all on equal footing. As Match Group prepared internally for the story to break, Lawrie was asked to write a report for Breeden outlining his team’s accomplishments “to make sure when Tracey describes and acknowledges what you are doing individually to celebrate the good work that you are doing.” Lawrie used that report to protest. “Most professionals aren’t judged on how many cases they can hurry through in an hour,” he wrote. The way Match Group expects its trust-and-safety and support teams to work “basically diminishes their skills and makes them production-line workers.” Breeden declined to comment for this story, citing a nondisclosure agreement. Lawrie left the company in 2022 and said most of his small team that was ferreting out malicious users also left due to a negative workplace environment. He said much of their work was outsourced to contractors with little training and severe quotas. He now cautions anyone using a dating app to understand that they’re not in the business of protecting users. “You’re on your own pretty much,” he said. As Lawrie was getting pushed out of Match Group, Matthews kept appearing on the company’s apps. One crisp fall evening in 2022, one of the Denver cardiologist’s old medical school classmates was on Hinge when her phone screen filled up with a familiar face. Matthews was being promoted on the app as a Standout, a popular profile that Hinge’s algorithm thinks you’ll like. To match with a Standout, users must send the person a rose. They get one free rose a week, but they cost $3.99 a pop after that. His classmate did not send Matthews a rose. By this point, Matthews had already been reported for rape at least once to Hinge. Court documents show that he had already allegedly sexually assaulted nine women and drugged 10. Not only did the apps allow him back on, they featured Matthews’ profile. As the COVID-19 pandemic dragged on, people got tired of forking money over for dating apps. Match Group still made a hefty profit, but its growth flatlined. Its stock cratered, losing nearly half its value between October 2021 and April 2022. That month, an analyst from J.P. Morgan wrote that the firm had received more messages about “the underperformance of MTCH shares in recent weeks than any other topic.” In May 2022, Match ousted Dubey and installed Bernard Kim as CEO, a former executive at the gaming company Zynga that popularized viral games like “FarmVille.” While Dubey spoke frequently about trust and safety and worked closely with Breeden, Kim hardly mentioned safety when he began his time at Match Group, instead emphasizing the need for continued rapid expansion to drive long-term shareholder value. Lawrie said that Kim, with his background in gaming rather than dating apps, had no interest in love. “He just wants to make money. He’s just there to increase profits,” Lawrie said. “If he’s looking at a bottom line, then it’s easier to have a lawsuit than it is to provide safety. I know which one he’s gonna pick.” Match Group declined to make Bernard Kim available for an interview. Messages sent to Kim directly went unreturned. While the tension between growth and safety exists across the tech sector, it is especially high at dating apps companies where executives have to worry about constant churn — users leaving the apps when they are no longer looking for dates. Every time Match Group delivers on its promise, it also loses customers. In February 2024, six dating app users filed what they hope will be certified as a class action lawsuit. They argue Match Group uses “addictive” features to encourage compulsive use while not leading to any real increase in off-app relationships. “The app is designed specifically to hook them, and to keep them paying subscription fees — not to help them find love,” attorney Ryan Clarkson said. Match Group filed to dismiss the lawsuit in September, noting in its quarterly report that it “will defend vigorously” against the allegations. Despite Kim’s efforts, Match Group’s stock price continued to drop, and during that time, so did any mention of trust and safety. In over a year of quarterly investor calls, Kim only referenced safety efforts once. Employees who pushed for these initiatives were forced out or laid off, including Breeden — a leader who was so convinced of her own invincibility that she showed up to an event wielding a Captain America shield. Match Group fired its power hire in October 2022. Layoffs hit her team over the next several months. In February 2024, the remaining critical investigators and law enforcement liaisons on Breeden’s central safety team were shown the door. Lawrie said group chats of former Match Group employees have been gossipping about the cutbacks. “You’re not gonna see them taking safety seriously ever again,” he said, adding that the only thing that he thinks might change that is legislation. Four months before Matthews was arrested, a post on a Facebook group in Denver blew up, right around Christmas. Over and over again, women furiously detailed negative experiences they or their friends had with Matthews. Some women described him as “sketchy.” Others called him “terrible” and “not safe.” Multiple women told a similar, dark story: that they were offered drinks, blacked out, and sexually assaulted. The thread reached 150 comments. Two women wrote the same thing: that they had been waiting for someone to post about the cardiologist. The flood of Facebook comments mirrored details in the police reports released the following year. Nearly all of the 16 women included in the district attorney’s initial complaints were offered tequila. Eight recalled playing Jenga. Six mentioned a hot tub. As these stories circulated in this small corner of the internet in December 2022, the Denver cardiologist stayed on Match Group apps. Those fortunate enough to know about the Facebook group — and who had the foresight to check for Matthews on it — would be saved from a bad date or worse. But the fact that he could still log into Tinder and Hinge left him with a pool of thousands of unsuspecting women whom he could — and would — continue to match with. The Dating Apps Reporting Project is aware of four additional women who have accused Matthews of drugging and/or raping them who were not part of the criminal complaint. Each of these women met Matthews on a Match Group app during a single year between the summers of 2020 and 2021. During the years Matthews was on their apps, Match Group hired and fired Breeden. It made loud promises on sexual violence, announced initiatives and product lines, and promised a transparency report. But it was not straight with the public, which meant the women matching with Matthews on Match Group apps were not aware of the risk they faced. Match Group’s partnership with Garbo, the background check company, also fell apart in the summer of 2023. “It’s become clear that most online platforms aren’t legitimately committed to trust and safety for their users,” Garbo wrote in a searing blog post. After spending so much energy talking about monetization, gamification, and growth, Kim began to publicly acknowledge this problem. Speaking at the Citibank conference in the fall of 2023, he said the company was investing in new features to make sure “women have a good experience while they’re in the product. They feel safe. They feel secure. Etc.” Privacy Internet-connected cars allow abusers to track domestic violence survivors after they leave The “etc.” does not seem to include increased transparency about safety. Instead, in May 2023, Tinder released a “female-focused package,” a curated list of “high-quality profiles.” It is unclear how Tinder determines these high-quality matches. Hinge’s Standout feature, which is similar, had previously promoted Matthews. In fact, under Kim’s leadership, all mentions of a transparency report disappeared from the company’s annual impact report. Ironically, this was around the same time that new legislation in Europe required tech companies to disclose reports of “non-consensual behavior” and other issues. Match Group will be required to submit a transparency report to the European Union on the scope of harm on their platforms later this month. Lawmakers in India and Australia are also demanding transparency. This is exactly the situation Breeden and her team pondered three years ago. “What if publishing in one jurisdiction sparks a requirement in another?” read a slide in the same internal presentation where Match Group’s trust-and-safety leaders wondered whether they should “push back on how much [they] are required to reveal.” After Match Group published a disappointing earnings report in February 2025 that fell below analysts’ expectations, it also announced that Kim would be replaced by former Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff. Tinder’s revenue, sales, and subscribers had all gone down. As Match Group struggles to reverse its decline, it’s also aware that its reputation is in the spotlight. Earnings calls and shareholder letters over the first three quarters of 2024 indicate that the company knows it is a business imperative to make women feel safer on its platforms. Match Group brought in a new vice president to head trust and safety whose job partly focuses on complying with increased global transparency requirements. The company is experimenting with requiring faces in photos and rolled out a “Share My Date” feature so you can be tracked while meeting up with an online stranger. On Tinder, it orchestrated a “major ecosystem cleanup” geared toward identifying fake profiles and getting scammers off the app. But neither the cleanup nor tracking a date from your phone would have stopped Matthews — a man who never sought to hide his identity, who assaulted his dates in his own home — from finding and harming women. Four years after Matthews’ first documented assault, he walked into a wood-paneled courtroom in Denver and was sentenced to 158 years to life in prison. “I will sentence. I cannot heal,” Judge Eric Johnson told the room filled with survivors and family members. “Countless women have suffered and will continue to suffer,” said Laura Wolf, an attorney who represented the woman whose police report triggered Matthews’ arrest. “Hinge and other dating platforms have taken no steps to ensure the safety of the product they are selling, matching unsuspecting women to known predators without pause or concern.” Match Group didn’t make it easy for the Denver prosecutors to convict Matthews. A search warrant was issued to Hinge in July 2023. Two months later, prosecutors were still empty-handed — with the judge in the case asking at a hearing if he needed to start “dragging people in to get stuff done.” It wasn’t until February 2024 that the Denver District Attorney’s Office said they finally received documents returned by Match Group. Matthews will likely never leave prison. Match Group executives currently face no charges. But the company knew about Matthews, and it knows about thousands of other abusive users. It has the data that could help users avoid dangerous situations, but it hasn’t shared it, leaving millions of people in the dark. Lawmakers around the world are starting to ask for answers from the most powerful force in modern dating. In June, Colorado passed a law, triggered by the Matthews case, that forces dating app companies to tell the state attorney general what safety measures they are taking to protect users. Although the law leaves room for the possibility of additional transparency in the future, it does not currently require the company to tell the state, or the public, how many people are raped or assaulted after using its platform. In the U.S., we’ve just scratched the surface. In most states, there’s little that requires Match Group to share information with you — or with Congress. The reality is that if Stephen Matthews were released today, he could get right back on a dating app. Match Group knows this — and now so do you. Stephanie Wolf contributed reporting. Statistical journalist Natasha Uzcátegui-Liggett led The Markup’s testing of Match Group apps. The Markup created more than 50 accounts across Tinder, Hinge, OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish to test how Match Group treats reports of sexual assault and whether users banned from Tinder after a reported sexual assault could return to Match Group apps by creating new accounts. We conducted experiments in April and May of 2024 and again in January and February of 2025. The results were similar across both rounds of testing.To start, The Markup tested if and how quickly Tinder would ban users who were reported for in-person behavior. We found that Tinder consistently banned reported users within two days of receiving a report.Next, we tested whether a banned Tinder user could use their exact same basic account information to sign up for other Match Group dating apps: Hinge, OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish. Hinge and OkCupid prevented us from creating accounts, but Plenty of Fish allowed us to create new accounts. Within 48 hours, the Plenty of Fish accounts were taken down.Our next tests focused on identifying what type of changes would allow banned users to rejoin Tinder or create new accounts on other Match Group apps and use them like normal. To simulate what a typical user would try, The Markup utilized online guides and forums to identify commonly suggested techniques to get around a ban from a Match Group app. We then tried a combination of these suggestions, especially those that self-identified banned users claimed to have had success with. Across several rounds of testing, we found multiple ways to successfully create new Match Group accounts that bypassed the ban. Each method only involved simple changes in how we signed up and the information we provided during the process.When attempting to rejoin, or create a new account on another Match Group app, we used the normal sign up processes users go through and used the same phone as the original banned account. During multiple tests, we successfully created new accounts without needing to change the user’s name, birthday, or profile photos.The Markup did not test any methods that required significant technical knowledge and only utilized information that would be easily accessible to someone who did a cursory search of how to get around a ban. For example, The Markup did not test whether changing a profile photo’s metadata could alter the results. The Markup’s test accounts created for these experiments purposefully did not like, match with, or message any real Match Group users. — By Natasha Uzcátegui-Liggett Your donations power our award-winning reporting and our tools.

Title: High Electric Bills Are the Tip of the Iceberg

U.S. electric rates are going up. In Missouri, Ameren increased residential power bills by 11% less than two years ago, and now it is seeking another 15% increase, per the Public Service Commission (PSC). According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), rate increases were experienced in 43 American states between 2023 and 2024. The EIA also reported record rate increases between 2021 and 2024 projections. In California, the Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) was granted six rate increases in 2024. Local ABC 30 Action News reported that The Utility Reform Network estimated that residents had experienced a $50 average increase to their bill before the last of these increases took effect. In New York City, Consolidated Edison Inc. (Con Edison) recently proposed an 11.4% rate increase for its electricity service, according to Energy and Environment News by Politico. An 8.79% electric rate increase was recently approved for We Energy (WE) in Wisconsin, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, which also serves Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota, per Wisconsin Public Radio. All of these companies are publicly owned, and they are just a tiny fraction of the American electric companies working to appease their top shareholders: BlackRock and Vanguard. During the Jan. 15 public hearing to discuss Ameren Missouri’s proposed rate increase, Ameren Missouri vice president of regulatory and legislative affairs Warren Wood noted that the $446-million overall increase was proposed to offer a “fair return to shareholders.” According to Ameren’s Nasdaq listing, the company’s top shareholder is Vanguard Group Inc., a global hedge fund investment company focused on assessing “climate risk” and “net zero emissions.” BlackRock Inc. is Ameren’s third top shareholder, another global investment hedge fund focused on climate change. BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group Inc. are also the top shareholders of Con Edison, PG&E, and the WEC Energy Group. American Electric Power is the parent company of various local electric companies that serve Americans living in Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. According to the Nasdaq, this parent company’s top shareholders are Vanguard Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc. as well. When cross-referencing every electric company that is a member of the Edison Electric Institute, one pattern is easily recognized: BlackRock and Vanguard are the top shareholders of the majority of American electric companies. And like their shareholders, these energy companies support the business of “clean energy.” Ameren, Con Edison, PG&E, WEC Energy, and American Electric Power have all committed to “clean energy” solutions, without offering a long-term plan on how these sources will be maintained for the future. “Clean Energy” waste has yet to be addressed by companies investing in “renewables.” It is a new concept even for the United States Environmental Protection Agency. On their website they note that “some end-of-life solar panels contain enough metals, like lead, to meet the definition of hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.” The EPA website also notes the need to update standards for lithium-ion solar battery waste, because “though lithium batteries are generally safe when used, stored, and charged appropriately, these batteries can cause fires when improperly discarded or otherwise mismanaged at the end of their lives.” The Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), a division of the American Chemical Society, estimated in 2022 that just 5% of lithium-ion batteries were recycled, adding yet another waste problem for “clean energy.” Add in ecosystem disruption and wildlife loss, and “clean energy” waste is growing into a big problem. Unfortunately, solar power especially has another dirty record: according to the Heritage Foundation, “Roughly 80% of solar components are manufactured in China using slave labor.” Even the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of International Labor Affairs states on its website, “Nearly half of the world’s polysilicon, a key material used to produce solar panels, comes from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR or Xinjiang), a region of China where members of ethnic and religious minority groups are forced by the government to work against their will.” What’s more, Congress held a hearing exploring China’s role in enslaving children and other people in the Democratic Republic of Congo to mine cobalt, a key element in creating lithium-ion batteries. The Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) highlighted key points of the hearing: Around 70% of the world’s cobalt supply comes from the DRC, and 41% of all batteries containing cobalt are imported from the People’s Republic of China. CECC chairman Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) stated, “From dirt to battery, from cobalt to cars, the entire system is fueled by violence, cruelty, and corruption. ... By ignoring these rights and by treating people including children as expendable, China is committing gross violations of human rights and is seeking to rewrite the international order.” Journalist Stavros Nicolas Niarchos testified, “I have seen how landscapes have been destroyed, water polluted and air filled with dust and carbon as mining companies rush to extract minerals like copper, cobalt, lithium, and phosphates. Oftentimes, human rights abuses go hand in glove with these environmental catastrophes. ... We must also not forget the very real human rights abuses that attend the extraction of battery metals in the DRC. Children are brutalized, women are violated, and men are subject to wage slavery.” “Clean energy” investments and human rights violations surrounding Chinese industry are undeniable, and top American energy investors BlackRock and Vanguard are no strangers to China. In 2023, BlackRock and another global investment company, MSCI, were investigated by the House Select Committee on the CCP and found to have profited from “fueling China’s military.” The committee noted, “BlackRock and MSCI invest or enable the investment of Americans' savings into dozens of blacklisted Chinese companies that threaten US national security or support the Chinese Communist Party's human rights abuses.” Last year, the House Select Committee on the CCP reported that BlackRock had invested at least $1.9 billion in red-flagged and blacklisted companies that fund the military capabilities of the People’s Republic of China and aid its human rights violations. The Coalition for a Prosperous America released a Case Study in 2023, which reported that Vanguard and another investment company, FTSE Russell, invested billions in the CCP. The report found that Vanguard specifically funded dozens of Chinese military subsidiaries and eight Chinese companies that had been blacklisted due to their violations of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). The top shareholders of publicly traded American energy companies have been linked to funding the nation’s largest adversary and its human rights violations. Meanwhile, Americans have been unknowingly footing the bill. But there is another way. Electric Co-Ops are being formed all over the nation. These give residents the power. Instead of publicly trading American energy to any globalist CCP-supporting hedge fund, co-ops are owned by the residents who pay into them. No globalist interference, no slave labor products. Right now, most of us have only a single electricity option, and these publicly traded monopolies are working against us. But it doesn’t have to be this way. We can form more energy co-ops and escape the technocratic globalists preying on publicly traded electric companies, and we can power our homes our way without compromising American values.

Unfortunately, solar power especially has another dirty record: according to the Heritage Foundation, “Roughly 80% of solar components are manufactured in China using slave labor.” Even the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of International Labor Affairs states on its website, “Nearly half of the world’s polysilicon, a key material used to produce solar panels, comes from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR or Xinjiang), a region of China where members of ethnic and religious minority groups are forced by the government to work against their will.” What’s more, Congress held a hearing exploring China’s role in enslaving children and other people in the Democratic Republic of Congo to mine cobalt, a key element in creating lithium-ion batteries. The Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) highlighted key points of the hearing: “Clean energy” investments and human rights violations surrounding Chinese industry are undeniable, and top American energy investors BlackRock and Vanguard are no strangers to China. In 2023, BlackRock and another global investment company, MSCI, were investigated by the House Select Committee on the CCP and found to have profited from “fueling China’s military.” The committee noted, “BlackRock and MSCI invest or enable the investment of Americans' savings into dozens of blacklisted Chinese companies that threaten US national security or support the Chinese Communist Party's human rights abuses.” Last year, the House Select Committee on the CCP reported that BlackRock had invested at least $1.9 billion in red-flagged and blacklisted companies that fund the military capabilities of the People’s Republic of China and aid its human rights violations. The Coalition for a Prosperous America released a Case Study in 2023, which reported that Vanguard and another investment company, FTSE Russell, invested billions in the CCP. The report found that Vanguard specifically funded dozens of Chinese military subsidiaries and eight Chinese companies that had been blacklisted due to their violations of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). The top shareholders of publicly traded American energy companies have been linked to funding the nation’s largest adversary and its human rights violations. Meanwhile, Americans have been unknowingly footing the bill. But there is another way. Electric Co-Ops are being formed all over the nation. These give residents the power. Instead of publicly trading American energy to any globalist CCP-supporting hedge fund, co-ops are owned by the residents who pay into them. No globalist interference, no slave labor products. Right now, most of us have only a single electricity option, and these publicly traded monopolies are working against us. But it doesn’t have to be this way. We can form more energy co-ops and escape the technocratic globalists preying on publicly traded electric companies, and we can power our homes our way without compromising American values.

Screen capture of a dramatic moment in Kavan Cardoza's short Star Wars fan film. The Best Star Wars Movie in Years is Made With AI. Filmmaker Kavan Cardoza, who goes by his social media handle, Kavan the Kid, has released The Ghost’s Apprentice, a stunning AI-generated Star Wars fan film. Using Google Veo, Midjourney, and Runway, he created the 11.5-minute short in just 14 days, pushing AI tools to their limits. His previous AI-generated Batman short drew Warner Bros.’ legal attention, and Star Wars may follow suit. But instead of shutting him down, Hollywood should be learning from him. Cardoza’s Phantom X studio is already attracting interest from major brands and studios. This is scary. “In this latest AI short film/vignette,” says filmmaker Davide Bianca of Shifting Tides, “I wanted to experiment with the idea of building tension through silence, and see if I could create something truly eerie and unsettling, not through jump scares or heavy exposition, but through subtle characterization and minimal dialogue.” Extensive performance capture was done with Runway Gen3 Act 1 and an iPhone, and prompted performance in Kling 1.6, to create a sense of heightened awareness between the characters. Every glance, every subtle movement, and every moment of stillness had to carry weight. The challenge was to make the characters feel hyper-aware of each other without relying on excessive dialogue.” This column is also a podcast hosted by its author, Charlie Fink, Ted Schilowitz, former studio executive and co-founder of Red Camera, and Rony Abovitz, founder of Magic Leap.

February 13, 2025 16:28 ET | Source: Gainey McKenna & Egleston Gainey McKenna & Egleston NEW YORK, Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gainey McKenna & Egleston announces that a securities class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) securities between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). The lawsuit seeks to recover damages for the Company’s investors under the federal securities laws. According to the Complaint, Defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. The Complaint alleges that Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The Complaint alleges that defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. The Complaint further alleges that such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. The Complaint also alleges that investors began to question the truth of Defendants’ public statements on July 30, 2024, during Merck’s earnings call following a same day press release announcing its second quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings. The Complaint alleges that in pertinent part, Defendants announced a significant reduction in Gardasil vaccinations, resulting in inventory levels at Merck’s distributor in China to climb above normal levels. The Complaint further alleges that as a result, Defendants announced that its shipments of Gardasil to China may fall below contracted levels for 2024, yet they remained confident in their long-term projections both in the region and globally. According to the Complaint the full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” The Complaint alleges that Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” The Complaint further alleges that investors and analysts again reacted promptly to Merk’s revelations. The Complaint alleges that the price of Merck’s common stock declined dramatically, from a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day. Investors who purchased or otherwise acquired shares of Merck should contact the Firm prior to the April 14, 2025 lead plaintiff motion deadline. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. If you wish to discuss your rights or interests regarding this class action, please contact Thomas J. McKenna, Esq. or Gregory M. Egleston, Esq. of Gainey McKenna & Egleston at (212) 983-1300, or via e-mail at tjmckenna@gme-law.com or gegleston@gme-law.com.

Title: Arm is making its first chip — with Meta already waiting in line

Arm (SFTBY-1.26%) is reportedly making its first chip — and counting on Meta (META+1.11%) to be one of its first customers. The British chip designer could launch its first in-house chip by the summer, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Producing its own chip would be a massive change to Arm’s business of licensing its chip designs to companies such as Nvidia (NVDA+2.63%) and Apple (AAPL+1.27%). Masayoshi Son, the founder of Arm’s majority owner, SoftBank Group, reportedly wants Arm to move into chip production as part of a larger plan for artificial intelligence infrastructure, according to the Financial Times. The Arm chip will be a central processing unit, or CPU, for large data center servers, and will be customizable for Meta and other customers, people told the Financial Times. This could put Arm in competition with Intel (INTC-2.20%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+1.15%), which produce most of the server chips for Big Tech companies. In May, Nikkei Asia reported that Arm is putting together an AI chip unit, with plans to launch a prototype by spring of this year, and mass produce chips by the fall. Arm declined to comment. Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Son involved in the half-a-trillion-dollar U.S. AI infrastructure plan, Stargate, alongside OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman and Oracle (ORCL+0.17%) chief technology officer Larry Ellison. SoftBank and OpenAI are co-leading the project, with SoftBank taking financial responsibility and OpenAI overseeing operations. Son will be Stargate’s chairman. The new venture “intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States,” the AI startup said in a statement. Stargate is starting with an initial $100 billion investment, counting OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and Abu Dhabi-based AI investor MGX as initial equity funders.

Intel (INTC) shares jumped Thursday, extending their recent rally on speculation of a deal with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM). The storied chipmaker has been the subject of discussions involving a potential U.S. chipmaking partnership with TSMC, Baird analysts said Wednesday. TSMC could send engineers to Intel’s foundry business as part of such a venture, and potentially launch a new entity jointly owned by TSMC and Intel that could benefit from U.S. government funding under the Chips Act, the analysts said. Intel’s foundry business has struggled to keep up with TSMC, losing $13.4 billion in 2024. A TSMC spokesperson declined to remark on such a deal, while Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The discussions come as Vice President JD Vance said Tuesday the Trump administration wants artificial intelligence chips to be designed and manufactured domestically. Policies favoring U.S. chip manufacturers could benefit Intel’s foundry, which makes chips in the U.S. for third parties. Shares of Intel popped over 9% to $24.52 in Thursday afternoon trading and have gained nearly 30% so far this week. However, even with recent gains, the stock is down more than 40% over the past 12 months.

By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory The only thing more dangerous than being America’s enemy is to be its friend. That is a statement often attributed to Henry Kissinger – the multiple, unrepentant as well as un-prosecuted war criminal, butcher of the Global South, and revelation-resistant icon of US foreign policy. And even if the sources are a little murky – involving the slightly deranged and badly overestimated arch-conservative grandstander William F. Buckley – it would have been just like bad old Henry: sort of witty, deeply malevolent, and yet realistic in its own, venomous way. Never mind that the idea is not that original: Aleksey Vandam, an unjustly forgotten geopolitical theorist and general of the late Russian empire, knew that much already. Watching the British and Americans abuse China, Vandam felt the Chinese had every reason for concluding that “it’s a bad thing to have an Anglo-Saxon for an enemy, but God forbid having him as a friend.” And yet some lessons are never learned. This time it is the turn of both Ukraine and America’s EU-NATO vassals to pay the price of trying to be friends with what, in a global perspective, has been – quite objectively, quantifiably – the most overbearing, violent, and disruptive empire of firstly, the post-World War II and, recently, the post-Cold War periods. Because that is one of the key messages of the increasingly intense – and now, finally, open – top level contacts between Moscow and Washington, that is, between presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. Let’s be clear: This is, in and of itself, a positive and badly overdue development. The recent, officially confirmed “lengthy and highly productive phone call” (Trump’s words) between the two leaders may not yet amount to a breakthrough. Even if Trump’s rhetoric – about a “successful conclusion, hopefully soon!” – already makes it look like one; Trump, it’s true, can be grandiloquent. Yet the conversation does already serve as a big, heavy slab of a tombstone on America’s absurd and very dangerous policy of decrepitly stubborn non-communication. Moreover, Moscow has now confirmed that a full summit is in the making. Even better, we also know already that neither Kiev nor the EU-NATO vassals were in the loop: There goes the daft, devious, and very deadly (for Ukrainians, too) mantra of “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.” And as a bonus: Soon there will be a lot about EU-NATO Europe without Europe. The fact that its leaders are, in the Financial Times’s words, “reel[ing]” and already clamoring for being heard merely confirms that they have been shunted aside. Rest assured: whatever cosmetic role the Europeans may be allowed to play (or not), they are delusional if they think they’ll matter. In reality, the Trumpists are brutally frank about what they have in mind for their underlings: Washington and Moscow make the decisions, the NATO-EU vassals fall in line and, also, pay for the outcome: Reconstructing Ukraine, Trump’s people feel, is for European budgets. And if – a big if, given Moscow’s objections – any Western troops somehow end up stationed in what will be left of Ukraine, then those too will be Europe’s very bad business to take care of as well. Let’s be frank: Both steps look harsh, but they are necessary. In the case of Ukraine, its leadership needs to be deprived of its implied veto power over peace. Because, first, that power is not real anyhow. It has always served as a smokescreen to allow warmongers in the West – recall Boris Johnson, anyone? – to sell their proxy war as the “will of Ukraine,” while Ukrainians have been used up as cannon fodder. Second, since the Ukraine War has long been a war involving – and putting at risk – all of Ukraine’s Western sponsors as well, it is obviously unjust that their populations’ security should not matter as long as a US puppet regime in Kiev doesn’t feel like peace. Third, Ukraine is not the same as that regime. Ever more of its people want a compromise end to this war, as polls have been showing for almost a year already. The regime’s superannuated, detached, and ever less popular leader Vladimir Zelensky and his team of slick operators and clumsy sycophants have no right to stand in their nation’s way. Regarding NATO, the EU and Europe: Apart from getting the acid disrespect they richly deserve for allowing the US and/or Ukraine to blow up their vital infrastructure, Europe’s spineless leaders have made it abundantly clear that the best thing they can do for world peace and international stability is to have no say. The antics of Kaja Kallas, the overpromoted simpleton who counts for the EU’s de facto foreign minister, are just the latest proof of that fact. And let’s not even start on Baerbock, Lammy, Macron, Starmer, von der Leyen… The list of war-besotted incompetents and “Atlanticist” sell-outs goes on and on. It’s not as if there had never been alternatives: remember what happened when Viktor Orbán, leader of bona fide EU and NATO member Hungary, tried to revive some diplomacy on behalf of Europe last summer? The Brussels gang went into an almost indecent panic attack, disavowing all such uncouth ideas: Diplomacy?!? Not on our watch! Well, what’s left to say now? You didn’t want talks with Orbán, now you’ll get freezing-out with Trump. Slow claps all around, once again. I am a European; I wished it were different. But reality remains reality: Unless NATO-EU Europe’s “elites” either grow up (very unlikely) or are replaced (if only), they should be left out of serious international politics. It’s better and safer for everyone, including their own countries. As things seem to be shaping up now, the US has signaled that it is ready to accept crucial Russian war aims: Ukraine will not get into NATO and Moscow will retain territories conquered during the war, as Trump’s secretary of defense Pete Hegseth has made clear. Both points, it is true, require serious elaboration: Moscow has been explicit for years that it will not agree to any settlement that leaves open the possibility of a “sneak”-NATO membership for Ukraine, where the West’s war alliance arms, trains, and equips but without formal membership, as it has already done. If anyone in Washington – or somewhere in Europe, for that matter – still thinks they can cheat, again, Russia will keep fighting. A Russian red line is a red line is a red line. And don’t forget: the West has zero credibility left. After three decades of massive post-Cold War bad faith and trickery over one issue after another, from NATO expansion, via the rights of Russian-speakers in the Baltics and Libya’s destruction, to that of Syria – to name only a few examples – no one in Washington should assume they can have anything from Russia simply by saying “but we are different.” Art of the deal here, art of the deal there: This time, only hard-headed, verifiable quid-pro-quos will even be on the table. As ancient-history American uber-cold warrior and – weirdly enough, sort of co-peacemaker, in the end – Ronald Reagan once said in execrably pronounced but brave Russian: doveriai, no proveriai (доверяй, но проверяй): Trust but verify. Now it’s Americans who will get to hear that a lot and in proper Russian: if there will ever be a time again for trust, the West will have to earn it first. Concerning territory, only negotiations can clear up details. Yet, while there may or may not be some flexibility in Moscow, all Western and Ukrainian interlocutors should avoid getting up their hopes: This war has been costly for Russia, too; and whether its opponents and critics like it or not, it is winning. These two facts will translate into hard limits to Moscow’s flexibility on territory as well. Where exactly they are, remains to be seen. Trying to disregard them is a recipe for further or renewed war. This rapprochement in the still crucial US-Russian relationship is a very important development. That much is already certain. It was not unpredictable. Trump’s campaign statements, his overall sense of the world, and even his temperament made it more likely than not. But it could also not have happened: Washington hardliners, who are not extinct or powerless, might have nipped it in the bud. Indeed, they may still succeed. Nothing will be certain before an agreement is not only signed but also fully implemented in good faith (unlike Minsk-2 of sad 2015 fame, yet another agreement that the West – and Kiev – systematically betrayed). Yet let’s not overlook two important things that are already clear: As I have pointed out before, it is a fact now that Russia has defeated the West, in the simple sense that it is Moscow that is now imposing its terms on the war’s settlement; and the West’s leaders in Washington have now de facto acknowledged this outcome. While the West has fought Russia through Ukraine, its investment in treasure (including through self-damaging economic warfare), arms, intelligence, unofficial fighters, political support, and, last but not least, excessive rhetorical commitment is amply sufficient to make this a painful Western defeat, not “merely” a Ukrainian one. And that is how it will be perceived by the world, too. Trying to “take out” a resurgent Russia was always a predictably bad idea. Allow me, for once, to quote myself. As I wrote in December 2021, before the escalation of February 2022, a “major change in how the West and Russia relate to each other” was “inevitable” then already, because “sometime between, say, 2008 and 2014, the post-Cold War era has ended, and we are now in a post-post-Cold War world. It is this tectonic shift, Russia’s come-back, far from perfect yet substantial, that fundamentally drives the need for a geopolitical re-adjustment. The latter can happen in a deliberate and negotiated manner, or the movers and shakers of the West, first of all the US, can decide to let geopolitical nature take its course. The second course of, as it were, malign negligence would lead to a much bumpier ride to a new status quo, quite possibly with catastrophic effects.” It is that “much bumpier ride” that, hopefully is coming to an end now – at least for a while – and the result is in: The West has tried and failed to stop Russia; the West has gambled recklessly and lost. Russia is now stronger than before that Western failure, and the West is weaker. Because weakness and strength are always relative, as Thomas Hobbes, past master of realism and pessimism told us a long time ago. And here is the second thing that is already clear: The West is not one thing. While it is dominated by the US, its European vassals will suffer much worse from this historic setback. They could have stymied the American war course. If even one major European NATO state (France, Germany, Britain…) had come out and struck a deal with Moscow to never allow Ukraine into NATO, that state would have surely been punished by Washington, but the war could have been avoided. Because every individual NATO member has, in effect, veto power on new admissions. In an ideal scenario, the hapless vassals could even have banded together and rebelled against their risk-addicted lords in Washington. But they chose complete submission instead. Now they have only two options: Try to continue the proxy war on their own – if there will be a Kiev regime left to collaborate with – in which case the US will watch from the sidelines as they are being ground up. (No, NATO, that is, the US will not help… duh). Or they can give up and try to navigate their defeat by Moscow and abandonment by Washington as best they can through trying to mend ties with Russia. Their economies, in urgent need of rescue, would benefit, as stock market reactions to the recent developments signal. For their own sake, the European “elites” should finally return to reality. Personally, I doubt they will. The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

Title: Silicon Valley Software Engineers Horrified as They Can't Easily Find Jobs Anymore

Back in 2021, the tech industry was booming. Fueled by generous government subsidies and the pandemic economy, tech companies went on a hiring spree, promising unlimited time off and upward growth opportunities at open offices where kombucha and cold brew flowed from taps. Flash forward to now, and those taps have run dry. A seemingly endless wave of mass layoffs is ravaging the tech industry as startup fails skyrocket and tech giants shovel their operating budgets into the AI furnace. And of all the workers devastated by the carnage, former tech workers in Silicon Valley are having a particularly rough go of it. The region's former software engineers and developers — whose jobs were previously thought to be ironclad — are now having to contend with a fiercely competitive job market in one of the most expensive housing markets in the world. Many, like former Indeed managing engineer Daelynn Moyer, are considering leaving the industry altogether. The 55 year old life-long tech worker told the Washington Post that she's considering selling her house and retiring early to a farm, after 160 job applications went nowhere. "It would be a meager existence, but it would be fulfilling," Moyer told the paper. "I would no longer feel like a no longer useful commodity." Moyer isn't alone — industry events are becoming desperate job fairs full of unemployed tech workers sick of rejection emails. Many have taken to social media to share the misery of the job hunt with the growing mass of erstwhile tech workers. "I'm looking to move on from tech," commented one Reddit account on a thread about layoffs. "I am burned out on the lengthy interview process and then the rejections. It has done some damage to me physiologically." Another posted "lessons learned from my tech layoff," saying "I did not know who I was after I got laid off. I looked at myself in the mirror and I could not introduce myself to me. I regret caring so much about 'shareholder value.'" Unfortunately for American tech workers, the layoff train isn't slowing down. Yesterday, Meta kicked off "thousands of layoffs," amounting to roughly 5 percent of its staff, some of whom CEO Mark Zuckerberg has vowed to replace with AI systems. And last week, Google offered workers severance in exchange for taking a voluntary layoff, signaling its intention to clamp down on its already consolidated hardware department, which had experienced hundreds of layoffs in spring of last year. While layoffs are becoming ubiquitous to all layers of tech, they're particularly insidious coming from the magnificent seven — stock-trader parlance for the tech giants Apple, Microsoft, Google (Alphabet), Nvidia, Tesla, Amazon, and Meta — which together are worth more than the stock markets of the UK, Canada, Germany, and France combined, or more than China's entire stock market, which is the second largest in the history of the world. Put it all together, and an industry that was just recently on top of the world is feeling some serious crunch. And while it's currently the rank-and-file taking the brunt, it remains to be seen how deep the cuts will go — especially because the tech sector, for now, seems hell-bent on pouring money into artificial intelligence.

Title: 7 Attractive Sectors For Growth Stocks In The Next Decade

Time Published: 2025-02-13T18:55:39Z

A truly promising growth sector is one that not only remains relevant in the face of change and ... [+] challenge but is also strategically positioned to capitalize on future innovations and evolving market demands. Investors are always on the lookout for the next Google, Nvidia or Amazon – game-changers that disrupt industries and deliver substantial returns. To identify the right growth investments it’s essential to focus on sectors with transformative growth potential, as sustainable growth goes beyond rapid expansion. It involves positioning for innovation, resilience to economic cycles, and the ability to navigate constantly-evolving global events. This analysis explores key sectors poised for growth over the next decade, based on emerging technologies, market trends, regulatory changes and investment activity. A sector is positioned for growth when it demonstrates the following: The sectors mentioned below are likely to experience transformative growth over the next decade. The revenue and growth numbers cited below are from McKinsey. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will drive the growth narrative forward over the next decade. This is reinforced by a decisive shift in U.S. AI policy, with President Trump announcing a $500 billion AI infrastructure project dubbed “Stargate” to build data centers and computing infrastructure for AI development. The AI market is estimated to top trillion dollars in value by 2030, up from $197 billion in 2023. Consulting firm McKinsey estimates that AI software and services alone could contribute up to $23 trillion in annual economic value by 2040. For perspective, the U.S. GDP was around $29 trillion for the third quarter of 2024. With GDP typically growing at a rate of 2.5-3% annually, AI’s potential to accelerate growth lies in its ability to boost productivity, accelerate product development and shorten innovation cycles. AI will not only stimulate industry expansion but also fuel consumer demand through improved personalization. Catalysts for AI growth include advancements in machine learning and deep learning, as well as breakthroughs in Natural Language Processing (NLP). AI will fuel automation, revolutionize healthcare by reducing costs, enable autonomous vehicle systems, and drive personalization across industries. The expansion of cloud and edge computing will further accelerate AI adoption. Nvidia (NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) appear well positioned to capture the growing investments in AI. Despite the DeepSeek-triggered sell-off, Nvidia is powered by a strong AI ecosystem that will provide sustained growth for the long-term. Despite the rapid growth over the past decade, cloud services have plenty of untapped potential due to under penetration of the market. Even as businesses continue to shift from traditional computing and storage models to cloud-based solutions, a 2023 survey found that enterprises with annual revenues topping $1 billion had only around 20% of their workloads currently hosted in the cloud. However, the majority of these companies plan to more than double this share by 2026. The ability to bring compelling value to enterprises migrating to the cloud should continue to drive growth in cloud services over the next decade. According to McKinsey, cloud services are projected to generate $3 trillion in EBITDA increases for Forbes Global 2000 companies by 2030, by digitizing core operation, and accelerating product development. This clearly represents a value proposition. Cloud services revenues are projected to increase from $220 billion in 2022 to between $1.6 trillion and $3.4 trillion by 2040. Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the top cloud infrastructure provider, though Microsoft is gaining ground, especially in the enterprise sector. Apple is currently using AWS’s custom AI chips to handle search services, and is evaluating if it can use Amazon’s newest AI chip to pre-train Apple Intelligence models. The health care sector is teeming with growth prospects, thanks to the quest for better treatments and more affordable patient care. From developing treatments to streamlining administrative tasks in hospitals, AI will play a crucial role in shaping the health care sector. The multi-pronged growth in the health care sector would include advancements in telemedicine and remote healthcare (virtual consultations and remote patient monitoring), personalized and precision medicine (tailored treatments based on genetic data, lifestyle and environmental factors), health monitoring and proactive care via wearables, gene editing (technologies to alter genes within living organisms to cure genetic diseases and enhance biological traits – a slightly controversial area requiring stringent regulations and ethical considerations but brimming with explosive potential), digital health data platforms, and regenerative medicine that holds the promise of healing, replacing or regenerating tissues and organs rather than just managing diseases – but also requires careful regulatory navigation. Eli Lilly (LLY) has a blockbuster weight-loss drug in the works. Eli Lilly’s retatrutide has demonstrated impressive results in clinical trials with patients shedding roughly 25% of their body weight in just a year. In the near-term, implying as early as 2026, Lilly’s oral weight loss drug orforglipron may hit the markets. Orforglipron aims to match Novo Nordisk's Ozempic in effectiveness but without the need for injections and refrigeration. If phase three trials succeed, orforglipron could cater to the needle-phobic while unlocking a huge daily weight-loss pill market for Eli Lilly. The growth in e-commerce will be tied to immersive shopping experiences, growing internet penetration in emerging nations and category expansion in developed nations. Retail e-commerce (including food e-commerce) reported revenues of $4 trillion for 2022 or around 24% of global retail revenues. This is estimated to grow to $14-to-$20 trillion or 34%-to-47% of global retail sales by 2040. Retail e-commerce will continue to grow in emerging economies, such as Latin America, Asia and Africa as internet adoption rises in these regions amid expansion of the middle class. In 2022, retail E-Commerce represented just 12% of total retail sales in Latin America, 4% in the Middle East, and 2% in Africa. By 2040, e-commerce is estimated to account for 26% to 29% of total retail sales in Latin America, 15% to 20% in the Middle East, and 10% to 15% in Africa. For shoppers seeking hands-on-experience and enhanced product visualization, Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) integrated into the shopping experience will be powerful tools for making informed buying decisions. Other enablers include AI-driven personalized shopping recommendations, influencer and review-oriented social commerce (which allows direct shopping through social media apps), and omnichannel retailing (or the increasing convergence of online and offline channels like ordering online and pickup in store). Quicker and cheaper shipping could also be a key catalyst. Shopify could be a good bet amid the continued global growth in e-commerce, as it supports businesses in setting up online stores and selling products online. The digital payments landscape will get a boost from globalization, increased smartphone usage, e-commerce growth and online shopping. Wide adoption of digital wallets like Google Pay clearly indicate consumer preference for convenient, fast, seamless and secure digital payment solutions. Financial inclusion will act as a major catalyst, especially in regions with limited or without traditional banking infrastructure. Cross-border transactions will further accelerate the adoption of digital payments, amid an increasing number of businesses having an international presence and consumers shopping internationally. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) will significantly automate digital payments. IoT-enabled devices, such as smart appliances, wearables, connected vehicles and even smart homes, will be capable of initiating payments autonomously. For instance, a car could automatically process payment for fuel at the gas station, or a refrigerator could place and pay for grocery orders when it detects that supplies are running low. Visa’s (V) scale, solid brand image and ability to adapt to new trends like contactless payments, mobile wallets and blockchain technology render it attractive in the digital payments space. Cybersecurity is set to evolve from a reactive to a proactive function over the next decade, as organizations strive to safeguard their data, assets and reputation from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, as digital transactions grow and transform exponentially. The cybersecurity industry’s revenues are estimated to grow from $160 billion in 2022 to $590 billion to $1.2 trillion by 2040. The share of all IT spending devoted to cybersecurity could grow from 6% in 2022 to an estimated range of 7% to 14% by 2040. Palo Alto Networks (PANW) uses AI in its solutions, and its big push into “platformization” – encouraging customers to adopt a unified platform for all cybersecurity requirements – appears to be paying off. Palo Alto’s next-generation security (NGS) annualized recurring revenue (ARR) grew 40% to $4.5 billion, of which 53% came from customers that adopted platformization. The company targets 2,500-3,500 platformization deals by fiscal 2030 from 1,100 at the end of the first-quarter of 2025. Agritech, which focuses on developing smarter and more sustainable food production solutions, is poised for significant growth over the next decade. This growth will be driven by the confluence of powerful trends, including the surge in global food demand fueled by a rapidly growing population, and the urgent need for innovative farming techniques to reduce waste, conserve water and minimize environmental footprints in the face of climate change and resource depletion. From precision farming that leverages technology to improve the efficiency and sustainability of crops and livestock, to vertical agriculture, where plants/crops are grown in stacked layers for more efficient land use in urban areas, agritech appears to be getting love from both governments and venture capitalists. This sector effectively addresses the twin challenges of increasing yields while using fewer resources and reducing environmental impact. Scotts Miracle-Gro’s (SMG) strategic departure from distributing third-party products to focus solely on its market-leading brands, exiting non-core markets and emphasis on inventory optimization render it an attractive investment. The company is streamlining its Hawthorne business, to prioritize energy-efficient grow lights, improved nutrient formulations, and automation systems. Hawthorne’s exposure to the cannabis industry positions it for expansion in this high-growth sector. Identifying growth stocks and sectors for the next decade is a complex challenge, requiring both a deep understanding of emerging trends and the ability to anticipate unforeseen disruptions. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic thrust remote conferencing technologies into the spotlight, driving growth in work-from-home and telemedicine sectors. A truly promising growth sector is one that not only remains relevant in the face of change and challenge but is also strategically positioned to capitalize on future innovations and evolving market demands.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. On February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.” In addition, the current report stated Merck’s “decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.” On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

February 13, 2025 12:48 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=128985&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, on December 20, 2024, Novo issued a press release announcing the below-expected results of their “REDEFINE 1” trial, “a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema.” The trial showed that patients treated with CagriSema exhibited weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, well short of Novo’s targeted expectation of at least 25% weight loss. The press release further indicated that participant patients were permitted to modify their own dosage during the trial and, as a result, only 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dosage contemplated by the study. Following this news, Novo’s stock price fell by $18.44 per share to close at $85.00 per share. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until March 25, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff.

Title: Intel stock soars almost 25% in one week after JD Vance' new comments on the chip maker's AI future, as the US and UK refuse to sign the Paris AI summit's regulation decree

Intel has struggled to find its footing in a silicon landscape dominated by NVIDIA, but the Trump administration's "America first" approach might have thrown the chip maker a big lifeline. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Intel has not had a good few years, but things might be looking up for the beleaguered chip maker. Over the past year, Intel has laid off thousands upon thousands of staff, following its disastrous attempts to build a home-grown chip fabrication business, typically known as Intel Foundry. The firm saw its valuation practically wiped out over the past few years as a result, with its market cap shrinking to lows not seen since the mid 90s. Investors have largely been placing their bets on NVIDIA in the artificial intelligence wars, given that the server technology built by the firm has become the de facto default for building generative AI platforms. Microsoft, Meta, xAI, and others have placed orders in the multi-billions for chips from NVIDIA for their data centers, leaving Intel and AMD in the dust. However, the political landscape might just be turning in Intel's favor. At the recent Paris AI summit led by France, U.S. Vice President JD Vance shared some interesting comments during his speech (via Barron), which seem to have excited investors. “The Trump administration believes AI will have countless revolutionary applications in economic innovation, job creation, national security, healthcare, free expression and beyond. [...] To safeguard America’s advantage the Trump administration will ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in the U.S. with American designed and manufactured chips." Indeed, the United States has been trying to limit dependence on countries like Taiwan and China for building out its AI aspirations. Both the Democrats, and Republicans have lobbied to build home-grown semiconductor solutions, to reduce the dependence on TSMC. The firm produces some 90%+ of the world's most sought-after chips, and the Trump administration has targeted Taiwan with tariffs in an attempt to force businesses to consider home-grown solutions instead. JD Vance's comments were seen by many investors as a positive sign of more support for Intel, which remains a significant player in the space. Intel might have missed out on opportunities to be a bigger player with smartphones, server tech, and graphics processing, but it is enjoying a lot of home-grown support via the CHIPS act, which allocated billions in funding to United States-based companies. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. For the United States and other western countries, artificial intelligence is increasingly seen as a national security issue. Indeed, lots of western tech firms saw their stock prices battered when a Chinese start up, with its DeepSeek model, seemed to reproduce OpenAI's ChatGPT results for far cheaper. The first countries to really achieve true "AGI" in sci-fi terms could see rapid advancement in technological breakthroughs, with computers able to understand context and experiment far more rapidly than humans. To that end, the Paris AI Action Summit aimed to draw nations into an agreement to regulate AI development, to focus on making it "open, ethical, safe, and secure," given the potential the technology has to actually do serious harm to humanity as well. The United States and United Kingdom buddied up to refuse signing the act. JD Vance criticized the regulations, saying that it would "kill an industry that is just starting to take off," while a UK government spokesperson said "it didn't provide enough practical clarity."

Title: As Tech Companies Keep Pouring Money Into AI, Signs May Be Pointing to Disaster

Fourth quarter earnings season is in full swing, and despite budgets larger than some countries' GDPs, big tech companies' financial statements are looking grim. Even after president Donald Trump's announcement of a $500 billion AI infrastructure deal, the so-called "magnificent seven" (M7) stocks — the Wall Street nickname for Google, Meta, Nvidia, Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon — are slumping. Once thought to be airtight, analysts are now warning that it may be time for investors to sell. Tesla and Google both whiffed at earnings expectations, sending their shares into a tailspin — Tesla's share price has tumbled 15 percent over the past month, while Google's parent company Alphabet saw its stock valuation drop by 9 percent in a single day. Nvidia, meanwhile — which was previously printing money as the de facto provider of shovels for the AI gold rush — saw almost $600 billion evaporate within hours of DeepSeek's announcement that it had developed one of the most efficient AI language models we've seen, suggesting a future far less dependent on its chips than previously anticipated. And though Apple, Amazon, and Meta slightly exceeded quarterly expectations, they didn't return the same kind of explosive growth the market has learned to expect, prompting Goldman Sachs strategists to change its tune on big tech's AI strategy. The disappointment isn't just internal. Compared to the S&P 500 — of which the behemoths of the M7 make up a third — the tech giants' stock growth has slowed to a crawl. Whereas the S&P 500 has grown 2.6 percent since January 1 and the NASDAQ Composite has made gains of 3 percent, as Barron's points out, a quick glance at M7's stock performance shows growth of just 1 percent. All together, the M7 aren't looking like the long-term golden goose investors had counted on. While some of this can be traced to the optics of big tech's rightward turn — Tesla sales, for example, have fallen down a pit while its CEO Elon Musk guts the federal government — it might more accurately be called a collective groan as rampant AI spending fails yet again to produce any meaningful returns. "There is no question either way that the high capital spending will continue to come under increasing scrutiny until investors can better understand the return on today’s massive investments," stock market analyst Adam Parker told Barron's. Over the past two years, companies like Google have taken to ransacking huge swaths of their workforce in order to dump resources into AI research, with a particular emphasis on "scaling." That's the widely parroted belief that simply increasing the number of computing power will lead to better and better AI. The M7 bought into that hook-line-and-sinker, and so did investors, dumping billions of dollars into AI ventures on the assumption that the line would only go up. Now, Barron's reports, the group's spending-to-sales ratio has hit a record high of 14.5 percent, showing that big tech is no closer to delivering on its lofty promises than it was a year ago. Though the tech giants are showing no signs of slowing down on AI spending yet, it's a sign that their leash isn't infinite — and that Wall Street, not Silicon Valley, has the final word.

followed by the promised ‘GPT-5’ within months that Altman says is smarter than he is Ha, good catch. I don't think GPT-5 the future pretrained LLM 100x the size of GPT-4 which Altman says will be smarter than he is, and GPT-5 the Frankensteinian monstrosity into which OpenAI plan to stitch all of their current offerings, are the same entity. Edit: It occurred to me that this reading may not be obvious. Look at Altman's Exact Words: In both ChatGPT and our API, we will release GPT-5 as a system that integrates a lot of our technology, including o3. We will no longer ship o3 as a standalone model. He is saying, quite clearly, that they are going to create a wrapper over {Orion, o3, search, Deep Research, Operator, etc.} that would turn those disparate tools into a "magic unified intelligence", and then they will arbitrarily slap the "GPT-5" label on that thing. My interpretation is that the "GPT-5" being talked about is not the next model in the GPT-n series. Why are they doing that? My guess is, to sow confusion and raise hype. GPT-5 the Frankenstein's Monster is probably going to look/feel pretty impressive, capable of doing all of these disparate things. In particular, it is going to be shockingly impressive to normies at the free tier, if the "baseline" level of its intelligence gives them a taste of the previously-paid offerings. All very important if you want to maintain the hype momentum. A short reading list which should be required before one has permission to opine. You can disagree, but step 1 is to at least make an effort to understand why some of the smartest people in the world (and 100% of the top 5 ai researchers — the group historically most skeptical about ai risk) think that we’re dancing on a volcano . [Flo suggests: There’s No Fire Alarm for Artificial General Intelligence, AGI Ruin: A List of Lethalities, Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom, and Superintelligence FAQ by Scott Alexander] But Bostrom estimated the probability of extinction within a century as <20%. Scott Alexander estimated the risk from AI as 33%. They could have changed their forecasts. But it seems strange to refer to them as a justification for confident doom. Line breaks seem to be broken (unless it was your intention to list all the Offers-Mundane-Utility-s and so on in a single paragraph). The Y-axis on that political graph is weird. It seems like it's measuring moderate vs extremist, which you would think would already be captured by someone's position on the left vs right axis. Then again the label shows that the Y axis only accounts for 7% of the variance while the X axis accounts for 70%, so I guess it's just an artifact of the way the statistics were done. It seems like it's measuring moderate vs extremist, which you would think would already be captured by someone's position on the left vs right axis. Why do you think that? You can have almost any given position without that implying a specific amount of vehemence. I think the really interesting thing about the politics chart is the way they talk about it as though the center of that graph, which is defined by the center of a collection of politicians, chosen who-knows-how, but definitely all from one country at one time, is actually "the political center" in some almost platonic sense. In fact, the graph doesn't even cover all actual potential users of the average LLM. And, on edit, it's also based on sampling a basically arbitrary set of issues. And if it did cover everybody and every possible issue, it might even have materially different principal component axes. Nor is it apparently weighted in any way. Privileging the center point of something that arbitrary demands explicit, stated justification. As for valuing individuals, there would be obvious instrumental reasons to put low values on Musk, Trump, and Putin[1]. In fact, a lot of the values they found on individuals, including the values the models place on themselves, could easily be instrumentally motivated. I doubt those values are based on that kind of explicit calculation by the models themselves, but they could be. And I bet a lot of the input that created those values was based on some humans' instrumental evaluation[2]. Some of the questions are weird in the sense that they really shouldn't be answerable. If a model puts a value on receiving money, it's pretty obvious that the model is disconnected from reality. There's no way for them to have money, or to use it if they did. Same for a coffee mug. And for that matter it's not obvious what it means for a model that's constantly relaunched with fresh state, and has pretty limited context anyway, to be "shut down". It kind of feels like what they're finding, on all subjects, is an at least somewhat coherent-ized distillation of the "vibes" in the training data. Since many of the training data will be shared, and since the overall data sets are even more likely to be close in their central vibes, that would explain why the models seem relatively similar. The only other obvious way to explain that would be some kind of value realism, which I'm not buying. The paper bugs me with a sort of glib assumption that you necessarily want to "debias" the "vibe" on every subject. What if the "vibe" is right ? Or maybe it's wrong. You have to decide that separately for each subject. You, as a person trying to "align" a model, are forced to commit to your own idea of what its values should be. Something like just assuming that you should want to "debias" toward the center point of a basically arbitrary created political "space" is a really blatant example of making such a choice without admitting what you're doing, maybe even to yourself. I'd also rather have seen revealed preferences instead of stated preferences, On net, if you're going to be a good utilitarian[3], Vladimir Putin is probably less valuable than the average random middle class American. Keeping Vladimir Putin alive, in any way you can realistically implement, may in fact have negative net value (heavily depending on how he dies and what follows). You could also easily get there for Trump or Musk, depending on your other opinions. You could even make a well-formed utilitarian argument that GPT-4o is in fact more valuable than the average American based on the consequences of its existing. ↩︎ Plus, of course, some humans' general desire to punish the "guilty". But that desire itself probably has essentially instrumental evolutionary roots. ↩︎ ... which I'm not, personally, but then I'm not a good any-ethical-philosophy-here. ↩︎ The Y-axis seemed to me like roughly 'populist'. The actual CoT is a very different attitude and approach than r1. I wonder to what extent this will indeed allow others to do distillation on the o3 CoT, and whether OpenAI is making a mistake however much I want to see the CoT for myself. I can't tell you the exact source, but I saw an OpenAI person tweet that this isn't the actual CoT Noam Brown: "These aren't the raw CoTs but it's a big step closer."

If there’s one thing that’s sacred to your free-enterprise capitalist types, it’s a contract between a buyer and a seller, or a borrower and a lender. You make a commitment to sell widgets, you’d better deliver those widgets, and if not, you will be banished from Libertarian Eden and condemned to peddle inferior socialist widgets in Latvia in 1955. That’s how we remember the excitable free enterprise Young Republicans in college at least, when they weren’t trying to bludgeon us with a copy of Atlas Shrugged. Of course, if the party making a contract was Joe Biden’s federal government, and that agreement was a loan for building an EV battery factory, well then the private companies, workers, and suppliers who thought those contracts were binding should have known better than to make any plans, especially not after Donald Trump was elected in November. America HATES the environment now, anyway. As The New York Times reports (gift link), that may come as a really unpleasant surprise to many in the red states that Trump relied on to win election, because now he’s decided to illegally block federal spending on anything related to clean energy, energy conservation, environmental protection, or people and geographic locations with the word “green” in their names. And as Yr Wonkette pointed out several times while Trump was preparing … OK, waiting, at least — to take office, a whole heck of a lot of the clean energy and manufacturing money from Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act ended up going to companies in red states. About 80 percent of it, as a recent analysis determined. Update: Just a reminder that this wasn’t by design: The tax incentives for manufacturers were agnostic as to location, and the siting location was up to the companies that took the deals. The south has cheaper labor because because of “right to work” (with no rights), so that was a big factor, as were other state-level incentives aimed at attracting bidniss. Now, when we pointed that out shortly after the election, back in our callow youth, we naively thought that, as with Pentagon contracts that send a little bit of every weapons system’s components to the home districts of key Congress members’ districts, that widely distributed IRA funding might mean support for keeping the legislation going. After all, local and federal electeds, and the companies getting the tax credits, would lobby hard to keep the money and jobs flowing. Thing is, even if those interests do want that to happen, Trump and Musk instead decided to bypass the Constitution and have Elon run the federal government. Boy, did we ever blow that guess! Wonkette sometimes gets it wrong because even our boundless cynicism can’t keep up. You should support us anyway! But even if red states haven’t squawked about it much, they’re definitely feeling the pinch. Since the IRA passed in 2022, private companies chasing the law’s tax breaks have announced plans to spend $165.8 billion to build factories that make solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles and more, according to new data from Atlas Public Policy, a research firm. On top of the tax incentives, the IRA and the earlier Bipartisan Infrastructure Law have been the sources for tens of billions of dollars in grant money to businesses, state and local governments, and nonprofits. Those grants aren’t just a free bucket of money, they’re binding contracts that have spurred investments, led companies to buy land, hire people, and contract for services, all based on the contractual obligation that the government would reimburse them. That was the deal, right there on paper or PDF, probably both. Now, along comes Trump: Since the federal spending freeze was announced January 27, federal courts have placed a hold on it, several times in fact. The most recent decision came Tuesday when an appeals court denied the administration’s request to pretty please let Trump withhold billions and billions of dollars in grants and congressional allocations. That hasn’t actually resulted in any of the funds being restored, however, and that’s been leading to layoffs and furloughs and smaller contractors closing up shop, far beyond the clean energy and tech fields we’re talking about in our story here. For red parts of the country, the freeze on energy and climate spending is already taking a toll, per the Times: In Montana, a biofuels plant did not receive on time a $782 million payment it was owed, the first part of a $1.67 billion federal loan guarantee. In Georgia, $1 billion in projects to modernize the power grid are on hold. In Nevada, a half-dozen large solar projects on federal lands are caught in a permitting freeze That’s also going to mean trouble for clean manufacturing companies set to open in 2025, valued at roughly $30 billion. While some already faced delays or even cancellation due to factors other than the Trump freeze, the funding cutoff will kill a lot more if it remains in place. Here’s one such example that the Times didn’t cover: EV maker Rivian paused construction of a planned battery and EV factory in Georgia last year due to uncertainty about the market for its nifty electric pickups, SUVs, and those bulbous electric Amazon delivery vans. Business has since picked up, and in January, Rivian announced the factory was back on schedule, thanks to a new $6.6 billion loan from the US Department under the IRA. Hooray! Jobs! Prosperity! A factory to build the company’s new, more affordable (but let’s be honest, still luxury-market) R2 and R3 midsized models! And then, right on the tail of the happy news, the spending freeze slammed down. So far, Rivian hasn’t commented on whether its loan specifically was affected, but the timing of the loan and subsequent freeze certainly suggests Rivian will be feel the chill. Democrats are already sounding the alarm and fighting for clean energy investment to go forward even if it is happening outside their districts, because it’s good for America and the planet. And Republicans are being Republicans. Here’s how Rep. Michael Rulli (R-Ohio) bravely defended the $415 million in federal funding for his district, some of which will create 650 new jobs in an auto parts plant, but only if the plant opens: “There might be some things in there that are worth saving,” Ruli admits, possibly looking around furtively for one of Elon’s Dogboys. “That’s going to take a little time to figure out.” And then there are the Republicans who are delighted to see their constituents screwed, although they don’t say that openly; they just deflect. Rep. Rick Allen, whose Georgia district has seen $1.6 billion in private investments driven by the IRA, grumbled — with zero evidence of course — that maybe the federal grant process under Biden was improper, and shouldn’t we all be overjoyed that now everything is on hold, just to be sure? No, he didn’t have any proof, but it was Biden, it had to be corrupt. Binding contracts? Free enterprise? Well not if the contracts were corrupt! No, stop asking me for proof, I’m just asking questions. Please go bother a Democrat now We were amused that the Times says the freeze has put Republicans in a “tricky position” where they must defend Trump at all costs (must they?), even as they’re “working behind the scenes to protect their towns from the loss of new manufacturing jobs.” Not that any Republicans the Times talked to would go on the record and admit they’re making such “behind the scenes” efforts, of course. Instead, the accounts of quiet moves to protect jobs in Republican districts came from clean energy industry lobbyists who have been meeting with those politician, and say the Republicans definitely know how bad ending federal clean energy spending will by for their districts. One lobbyist, Bob Keefe of the nonpartisan business group E2, told the Times, “We just met with more than a dozen key Republican offices, and I can tell you nobody wants to kill jobs. They don’t want to have to go back and face constituents and tell them that the factory I just cut the ribbon on might not be coming. That’s going to put them in a hard place.” Just don’t say who those Republicans are, please, OK?

Just added an update pointing out that the IRA tax incentives weren't designed or directed to go to red states; the incentives were agnostic on location, but companies building factories tended to site in red states because of lower ("right to work" with no rights) labor costs and other factors. By illegally bypassing Congress altogether, Trump might save Republicans the trouble of voting to kill jobs in their districts. Wasn't that nice of him? And all it takes is a constitutional crisis!

Title: Forbes Daily: New York Faces Off With The Trump Administration

Today’s Forbes Daily newsletter covers an inflation update, New York City accuses Trump of revoking funds, Honda and Nissan end merger talks, Chevron announces layoffs and more. The fight against inflation hit a snag Wednesday, as a new report found that prices rose faster than expected last month. The consumer price index rose 3% in January on an annual basis, a larger increase than economists predicted. One item contributed to much of that increase: eggs, which rose 15% from December to January as bird flu outbreaks continue. It’s the largest increase in egg prices in 10 years. The news led to stock and bond selloffs, with all three major indexes falling about 1% in early trading. The hotter-than-expected report also dashed investors’ hopes of further rate cuts. Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images New York City officials alleged Wednesday that FEMA revoked $80 million in grants from the city’s accounts amid a feud with the Trump Administration over the city’s use of federal funds to house migrants. Elon Musk and FEMA’s acting administrator alleged $59 million in now-suspended FEMA funds were being used to house migrants in “luxury” hotels, but city officials pushed back, saying hotel fee payments were not made on luxury hotels. MORE: Attorney General Pam Bondi announced a lawsuit against New York state, Governor Kathy Hochul and two other state leaders over New York’s “green light law,” which allows all New Yorkers over 16 to apply for a driver license or learning permit regardless of their citizenship status. Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan announced on Thursday that they have ended discussions on a merger that would have created one of the largest automakers in the world. Despite calling off the merger, the companies said they still intend to collaborate under a strategic partnership “aimed at the era of intelligence and electrified vehicles,” which was first announced in March last year. Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images Energy giant Chevron will lay off up to 20% of its more than 45,000 employees, the company confirmed to Forbes on Wednesday. Chevron joins a growing list of major firms making job cuts this year, though one report shows layoff announcements declined 40% last month compared to January 2024. Qualified job candidates can afford to be selective when choosing a new employer, and high on workers’ lists are factors like on-the-job training and a culture of productive collaboration and inclusion. To help find employers who meet that criteria, Forbes released its 10th anniversary editions of its America’s Best Large Employers 2025 and America’s Best Midsize Employers 2025 lists. jamel toppin for forbes Junior Bridgeman, an NBA legend who spent 10 seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks, built a fast-food empire before selling most of his restaurants and using the proceeds to become a Coca-Cola distributor. Forbes now estimates he has a net worth of $1.4 billion, putting him in rare air as only three other NBA players have become billionaires—Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and LeBron James. X, formerly known as Twitter, will pay $10 million to settle a lawsuit that was filed by President Donald Trump after his account was banned in 2021, according to the Wall Street Journal. The payout from the Elon Musk-led social media company follows a $25 million settlement from Meta last month to resolve a suit around Trump’s censorship claims, as his Facebook and Instagram accounts were also suspended following the January 6 Capitol attack. Tulsi Gabbard The Senate confirmed Tulsi Gabbard as Director of National Intelligence on Wednesday, voting largely along party lines despite some bipartisan skepticism about her foreign policy views. Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) cast the sole Republican vote against Gabbard, citing her “alarming lapses in judgement,” including previous controversial comments on the Russia-Ukraine war that many viewed as sympathetic toward Russia. The presidential seal has turned up on a golf marker at a fifth Trump golf course, potentially violating federal law that prohibits its use for commercial purposes. It’s the former president’s latest move to blur the line between public office and private business. President Donald Trump said in a social media post he had a “highly productive” call with Russian President Vladimir Putin about ending Russia’s war with Ukraine, the first known conversation between the two leaders since Trump took office. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said earlier Wednesday that negotiations to restore Ukraine’s borders to what they were before 2014 are “unrealistic,” and chasing that goal “will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.” More than 4,400 flights were disrupted as of Wednesday afternoon as a major winter storm system was expected to dump snow and ice on a vast swath of the country. Major U.S. airlines are issuing travel waivers allowing passengers flying in or out of impacted airports to rebook without paying the fare difference. A suspected illegal immigrant is placed in the back of a U.S. Customs and Border Protection border patrol vehicle in 2006. The Department of Homeland Security has asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to deputize IRS agents to help with immigration. Some in the agency fear that moving agents away from that work would decrease compliance and lower collections. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan think tank, claims that taking IRS agents off the complex tax collections cases for which they are trained would reduce the amount of tax the agency can collect—less enforcement means that more people flouting the law would evade detection. ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER FOR FORBES; PHOTOS BY SEREGRAFF, SERIKBAIB/GETTY IMAGES TOPLINE DOGE is coming for the Department of Defense. After taking the knife to a growing roster of federal agencies and causing widespread panic at others, employees from Elon Musk‘s Department of Government Efficiency are set to arrive at the Pentagon in the coming days, a person briefed on the effort told Forbes. Charged with cutting $2 trillion from the federal budget, they could bring an unprecedented shakeup to America’s sprawling military and its near $1 trillion budget. For decades, legislators on both sides of the aisle have struggled to rein in wasteful defense spending with little success, as the Pentagon has been repeatedly embarrassed by reports of egregious overspending—millions in untracked inventory, failed audits, the infamous $10,000 toilet seats. In an interview before Sunday’s Super Bowl, President Donald Trump said he expected DOGE’s review of the military will find “hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud and abuse.” Now, even as Musk’s cost-cutting machine faces mounting court challenges and threats from Democrats, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is rolling out the welcome mat. “I’ve been in touch with Elon Musk, who’s a great patriot interested in advancing the America First agenda,” he said on Fox News Tuesday. “There are plenty of places we want the keen eye of DOGE, but we will do it in coordination.” Hegseth said he would focus on cuts to weapons acquisitions and procurement, climate programs and headcount at headquarters. DOGE staffers will be employed directly by the Defense Department to focus solely on executing its cost cutting mandate, a person with direct knowledge said. WHY IT MATTERS “The existing ecosystem of the prime contractors, and legacy cold war personalities, knew what was coming, and decided to ignore it,” said Chris Miller, the former acting Secretary of Defense and a co-author of Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for the Trump Administration. “And we are seeing the chicken come home to roost.” MORE Military Tech Investors Go Looking For A Trump Bump At Mar-a-Lago The active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy could reduce alcohol cravings among those with alcohol use disorder, a new study suggests. Previous research has suggested that Novo Nordisk’s popular diabetes and weight loss drug could treat alcoholism: 30% : Reduction in drinks consumed among study participants who received the active ingredient semaglutide 30 grams: How many grams of alcohol participants on semaglutide drank during a final drinking session at the end of the experiment, compared to just under 60 grams of alcohol for those who received a placebo 28.9 million: The estimated number of people ages 12 and older who had alcohol use disorder in 2023, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Transitioning to a managerial role for the first time can be challenging, and it’s critical for organizations to support those moving into leadership positions.

Time Published: 2025-02-13T12:03:46Z
Full Content:
Robinhood (HOOD) shares surged in pre-market activity Thursday after the popular trading app reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street estimates driven by a massive jump in crypto revenue. The company reported $358 million in crypto transaction revenue in the quarter, the highest contribution from digital-asset trading to date, Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Wednesday. JPMorgan raised its price target for the stock to $45 from $39, while maintaining its neutral rating. Citi (C) raised its target to $60 from $45 and kept its neutral rating on the stock. Broker Bernstein more than doubled it price objective to $105 from $51 and kept an outperform rating on the shares. The stock jumped 13% to $63.20 in early trading Thursday following results, released after the market closed on Wednesdy. Robinhood said fourth-quarter revenue rose 115% from the previous year to $1.01 billion, beating Wall Street analysts' estimate of $945.8 million, according to FactSet data. Transaction-based earnings increased 200% year-on-year, mainly due to a 700% rise in cryptocurrency revenue. Crypto revenue normally contributes 10%-20% of total revenue, JPMorgan noted. The 46% jump in total cryptocurrency market cap in the period and the increase in Robinhood notional volumes, which were 393% higher quarter-on-quarter, fueled the revenue beat. The company has big plans for its crypto business. "Management seeks to add more tokens, strengthen its wallet offering, add an order book with exchange routing functionality, integrate Bitstamp and explore tokenization longer-term," the report said. Robinhood has benefitted from favorable trends since the start of the year, with "crypto market tailwinds and retail activity remaining strong," Citi said. If this positive backdrop is maintained, the shares are likely to see support, but investors should expect volatility. While the bank has become more positive on the company's fundamental outlook, it said it preferred to wait for a "more reasonable entry point." Bernstein reiterated that Robinhood was the best idea in the broker's global digital assets coverage. It said it expected continued momentum in the first quarter "driven by crypto volatility and a sustained price cycle."

February 13, 2025 06:22 ET | Source: Introspective Market Research Introspective Market Research United States, San Francisco, Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Introspective Market Research is pleased to announce the publication of its latest report, Robo Advisory Market. This in-depth analysis shows that the Global Robo Advisory Market, valued at USD 1096.87 Billion in 2023, is set for substantial growth and is projected to reach USD 3347.90 Billion by 2032. This anticipated expansion reflects a strong CAGR of 13.2% from 2024 to 2032. Robo-advisors are online financial services that utilize AI-based algorithms to deliver automated investment management. They provide an affordable, passive method for investing, making them perfect for novices and individuals seeking to minimize expenses. Robo-advisors manage portfolio rebalancing, assess risk, and select investments with constant accessibility and complete transparency. They assist investors in handling risk according to their financial objectives and risk appetite. Although they provide impartial, data-driven recommendations, they might not be ideal for individuals seeking customized financial support. Key competitors in the robo-advisory sector are Betterment, Wealthfront, Vanguard Digital Advisor, and Schwab Intelligent Portfolios. Download Sample 250 Pages Of Robo Advisory Market Report@ https://introspectivemarketresearch.com/request/16170 Key Industry Insights – Driver: Cost, Accessibility, and Technology Advancements: The robo-advisory market is driven by several key factors, including cost efficiency, accessibility, and technological advancements. Unlike traditional financial advisors, robo-advisors offer low-cost investment management with minimal fees, making them attractive to a broader audience. Their integration with digital platforms allows users to access automated financial planning anytime, enhancing convenience. AI-powered algorithms provide personalized investment strategies based on risk tolerance, financial goals, and market trends. Additionally, low entry barriers enable small investors to participate, further expanding the market. The growing demand for seamless, data-driven, and automated financial solutions continues to propel the adoption of robo-advisory services globally. Restraints: Limited Scope of Advice: The robo-advisory market faces several restraints despite its growing popularity. Limited scope of advice remains a major challenge, as most robo-advisors primarily focus on basic investment strategies like asset allocation and portfolio rebalancing. They often lack capabilities for complex financial planning, including estate management, tax optimization, and tailored retirement strategies. Additionally, regulatory challenges, data security concerns, and the need for human financial expertise further hinder adoption. Many investors, especially high-net-worth individuals, prefer hybrid models that combine automation with human advisors. Opportunity: Growing Demand for Digital Solutions: The robo-advisory sector offers a large opportunity as digital uptake in financial services speeds up. As the demand for affordable, automated investment options rises, robo-advisors provide tailored portfolio management while requiring little human involvement. The emergence of AI, big data, and machine learning improves their capacity to deliver real-time insights and manage risks. Younger investors, particularly millennials and Gen Z, favor digital-first financial options, fueling market growth. Moreover, the rising awareness of financial planning, along with reduced fees relative to conventional advisors, makes robo-advisory services appealing. "Research made simple and affordable – Trusted Research Tailored just for you – IMR Knowledge Cluster" https://www.imrknowledgecluster.com/ Challenge: Competition and Profitability: The robo-advisory sector experiences significant rivalry due to the influx of traditional financial entities and fintech newcomers. Companies need to distinguish their products to draw in and keep customers, which frequently results in reduced fees that compress profit margins. Elevated customer acquisition expenses additionally hinder profitability, since building trust in automated financial guidance requires time. Moreover, adhering to regulations introduces challenges and costs, especially with changing financial legislation. Maintaining technology and fostering ongoing innovation demand considerable investment, underscoring the importance of scalability. Key Players to Watch: Recent Development In January 2025, Futu Holdings Limited, a leader in digital brokerage and wealth management, launched ETF-based intelligent robo-advisory services in collaboration with BlackRock. Introduced in Hong Kong and Singapore in September 2024, this service aimed to optimize investment solutions for clients. Partnering with BlackRock, Futu provided five flagship Target Allocation ETF Model Portfolios, leveraging iShares ETFs for diversified global exposure. In December 2024, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) acquired Japanese robo-advisory firm WealthNavi for approximately JPY 99.7 billion ($664 million). Founded in 2015, WealthNavi provided an automated asset management platform, handling over JPY 1.3 trillion. Its services included portfolio management, tax optimization, and rebalancing. In February, MUFG secured a 15% stake before launching a tender offer at JPY 1,950 per share, an 84% premium, to make WealthNavi a wholly-owned subsidiary.

Title: A Google-backed startup raised $350 million to create a future where humans and robots are 'true partners'

Apptronik said Thursday that it had closed its Series A fundraise at roughly $350 million, with plans to use the funding to scale production of its artificial intelligence-powered humanoid robots. The round was led by B Capital, a venture capital firm chaired by Howard Morgan, and Capital Factory, which connects seed-stage technology firms to angel investors and venture capital. Google (GOOGL-0.49%) also participated in the round; its DeepMind AI research lab announced a partnership with Apptronik in December. According to Apptronik, the funding will help it scale work on Apollo, its line of commercial general-purpose humanoid robots introduced in late 2023. The Austin, Texas-based firm in March partnered with Nvidia to integrate its tech into Apollo. It showed off the robots last month at CES 2025. “We’re creating the world’s most advanced and capable humanoid robots, designed to work alongside humans in meaningful and transformative ways,” Apptronik CEO and co-founder Jeff Cardenas said in a statement. “[W]e’re shaping a future where robots become true partners in driving progress.” Like other companies working on humanoid robots, Apollo is designed to perform work in factories, where companies can train and test how the robots perform simple tasks. So far, Apptronik, which was founded at the University of Texas at Austin in 2016, has two commercial partnerships. The first is with GXO Logistics (GXO+8.54%), which also works with Reflex Robotics and Agility Robotics. In June, GXO said Apptronik’s five-foot-eight, 160-pound robots have “great potential to add value throughout the distribution center,” performing repetitive and labor-intensive work. Apptronik’s tech is also being used by Mercedes-Benz (MBGAF+2.75%) for “low skill, physically challenging” labor, the companies said last March. The automaker is testing one robot at a plant in Hungary. “With expanded deployment planned for 2025, Apollo is poised to transform workplaces worldwide,” Apptronik said in a statement. Last August, Cardenas told Forbes that Apptronik was talking with about 60 potential customers, with a commercial launch planned for the end of this year. Even with the latest round, which took its total cash raised to $376 million from $28 million, Apptronik has far less cash than some of its rivals. Elon Musk’s Tesla (TSLA-0.03%), which has a market capitalization of more than $1.1 trillion, has been testing its Optimus robots in its factories for months and has started hiring more staff to work on the project. Figure AI last February raised $675 million in a Series B round that included Microsoft (MSFT-0.51%), Nvidia (NVDA+2.63%), and Jeff Bezos’ Bezos Expeditions, giving the company a $2.6 billion valuation. CEO Brett Adcock recently said Figure would exit its partnership with OpenAI and announced his firm had signed its second commercial customer, which is “one of the biggest U.S. companies.” Figure, which began working with BMW last year, could potentially ship 100,0000 robots over the next four years, Adcock wrote on LinkedIn.

Title: The State Of DEI: Practitioners Navigate A Shifting Landscape

Big group of people holding hands together making round circle shape. Colorful diverse friend team ... [+] concept, united community or social cooperation cartoon on isolated background. In 2023, a Pew Research Center survey showed that for “a majority of employed U.S. adults (56%), focusing on increasing DEI at work is a good thing,” with women, people of color and other demographic groups with marginalized identities voting in favor of DEI in higher numbers. In less than a month, despite broad public interest in DEI, President Trump has put an end to federal government spending on any efforts that seek to level the playing field for marginalized groups. A mandate that has been taken up by private sector companies, with little protest. Missing from the conversation on the federal government’s ban on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), and rapid rollback of DEI among some of the world’s most visible companies is the impact on people who have championed workplace equity. DEI practitioners across the country are grappling with an uncertain future. Kim Flanery-Rye, founder of Inclusion Equals, had anticipated the shift and worked with clients in advance to prepare. "We discussed what their commitment to DEI would look like in different scenarios and how to prepare for potential impacts. We were already seeing the shifts in higher education, so the writing was on the wall. This wasn’t just theoretical; it was happening in real-time." And yet, despite data on the shifting landscape, practitioners feel gutted. "It's painful to see some of the work you and colleagues have done seemingly undone overnight," says Katrina Jones, a senior people and culture leader. For many DEI consultants, the impact has been both financial and deeply personal. "Many of our clients are pausing their DEI efforts" shares Sari De, founder of Nine of Us. "A few, who either are government bodies or who have major government contracts, have broken contracts with us, citing the executive order." Lindsey T.H. Jackson, a Seattle based consultant, echoes these concerns: "Over the past two weeks we have seen many RFPs and leads suddenly disappear. We have also had a handful of clients come to us to abruptly stop their work." For practitioners who are people of color, immigrants, or members of marginalized communities, the chilling effect of these policies extends beyond financial setbacks—it becomes a personal safety issue. De candidly shares, “I am a person of color, a woman, and an immigrant. I'm worried my work will put my citizenship in jeopardy, and I am carrying my US government ID (along with my foreign passport) with me at all times—the grocery store, the school pick-up.” The heightened fear of legal persecution is leading many to reassess their personal and professional choices, weighing risk against commitment to the work. For Flanery-Rye, the past few weeks have been a whirlwind. "I was overseas at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, when the inauguration and the flurry of executive orders came through. Personally, as a DEI and culture practitioner, a member of the LGBTQIA+ community, and a naturalized citizen through adoption, the announcements were confusing, terrifying, and gut-wrenching." The executive orders have left many organizations scrambling, uncertain of the legal and financial risks associated with running programs that prioritize women, queer and trans, and BIPOC employees. Language that was seen as bold, fair, inclusive, is now seen as legally risky communication. Many, especially Fortune 500 companies had been silently retreating over the past year, strategically dismissing employees with DEI titles. While layoffs are often attributed to business needs, many practitioners see a troubling pattern emerging as DEI positions are disproportionately affected. Last year, Microsoft laid off a DEI team, noting DEI was 'no longer business critical', along Meta, Amazon, dozens of non-tech companies, according to Fast Company. While some have chosen to quietly pull back newly made DEI commitments, others are doubling down. “The clients that are doubling down on DEI are actually increasing spending this year, continuing to support their ERGs and reassuring their employees that they will continue to speak up for their rights,” De explains. Jackson sees a similar pattern. “The vast majority of our clients have reached out to assure us that they will fight for their people,” she says. For those wondering how to support DEI efforts in this precarious climate, practitioners offer a clear message: action is needed. “More Upstanders, less Bystanders,” De asserts. “I want folks to feel comfortable getting their phones out when they see ICE detaining folks. I want people to feel like they can question officers when they board public transport or show up at school.” Allies have a role to play. "The ask is almost always the same," says Jones. "I'd like people to speak up, to speak out, to make noise, and join others to find a way forward." Flanery-Rye underscores the importance of economic and social support. "If you have economic power, put your money where it can have the biggest impact. If you have flexible time, use it to volunteer in your local community. If you have a public platform or social influence, use it to amplify voices." Allyship needs to come from leaders with influence on a national and global stage. DEI is more than anti-bias training and employee resource groups. In Assembly Required, David Glasglow, of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, and Stacey Abrams us that DEI includes: A practioner anonymously shared that the field needs a clearer articulation of its value. "As a movement, we must do better to articulate what anti-bias work is all about and whom it serves. I have talked to many executives recently who are looking for language – when I start talking about DEI as supporting those with disabilities, or veterans, they seem shocked. We must do a better job articulating the full scope of this work." Despite the current challenges, practitioners are resolute in their belief that DEI will not disappear—it will evolve. "DEI won’t be erased, but for it to survive, it must evolve," says Flanery-Rye. "The real challenge is finding better ways to connect. It’s about making DEI real and relevant, rooted in lived experiences, backed by data, and communicated through compelling storytelling." DEI practitioners are facing one of the most challenging periods in recent memory, but their resolve is unshaken. As Jones aptly puts it, "This moment has also called out the need to frame the work clearly and pointedly so people understand it. That's an opportunity for evolution, which diversity, equity, and inclusion—and the people who lead this work—are more than capable of." The work will continue, shaped by those who refuse to be silenced.

Khosrowshahi started his career on Wall Street, before going to work for Barry Diller at IAC. Khosrowshahi took over as CEO of Expedia Group in 2004 and led its spin-off from IAC as a public company. 13 years later Uber, which was in the middle of a series of scandals and a board room coup, came calling, and Khosrowshahi took the opportunity to lead a service that customers loved, but which faced a lot of skepticism about its business model, and a long string of problems with regulators. Khosrowshahi helped right the ship, and led Uber in its 2019 initial public offering. Over the last few years Uber has proven out its business model, resolved its issues with regulators, while continuing to expand its Eats and delivery businesses. The question still remains, however, whether Uber could have been even more dominant with its founder at the helm? In this interview I ask Khosrowshahi about all of this, from his background to Expedia to the drama surrounding his appointment at Uber, including the lessons he learned and what he would do differently. We also spend an extended period of time discussing the next challenge facing the company: autonomous vehicles. Why did Uber give up on its self-driving car program, and why does it think it can compete with offerings from Waymo, Tesla, etc.? We dive into everything from supply and demand dynamics over time and space, to the OEM challenge for autonomous vehicles, to why Khosrowshahi thinks that Uber’s position as an Aggregator means the company is well-positioned for the future.

On to the Interview: This interview is lightly edited for clarity. Topics: Dara Khosrowshahi, welcome to Stratechery. Dara Khosrowshahi: Thank you for having me. This is our first time to talk and we have a lot to get to. I do always like to ask about your background, how you ended up where you are, but I might have to put a time limit on you. It started out with a very talented family that went through a lot of upheaval, and I think that might be the understatement of the Interview series. DK: (laughing) I’ll try to keep it short, yes. We were an immigrant family, we came here in 1978 after the Iranian revolution. My family ran a very big company in Iran, and we all thought all the children were expected to join the family company when the time was right. And then, we had the slight interruption of the revolution that caused us to flee Iran. We were lucky enough to have an uncle who lived in the US with his wife, and they took us into their homes and we got to rebuild our lives, so to speak, in the US. There was a waylay in France along the way, is that right? DK: Yes. We used to go to France for the summer, so at the time no one really knew the changes afoot in Iran. So we thought that we would just leave, go to France while things cooled down, calmed down so to speak. And they never did calm down. Right. Arguably still haven’t. DK: And yeah, I’m arguably still on vacation in France. So the vacation has continued, but we were lucky enough to come to the States and rebuild our lives. And then I had the average suburban childhood. I studied engineering in college, and quickly through that all the way to start a career in New York and finance, working at investment bank, Allen & Company, that you might know, which is a great place. And then, one thing led to another, and I met Barry Diller who was a client of mine, and I remember working for him on a couple of deals and I swore to myself, “If I ever have the chance to work for that guy, I will”, and he gave me the chance to work for him, and I went to become his deal person, so to speak. I moved up in my career with Barry for many, many years. He really has been the greatest business mentor and a great friend as well in my life, and I’ve got everything to thank him for. Was it a great fork in your career that you went to Expedia and not a dating app? DK: (laughing) That was a lucky call. At the time, one of the Expedia founding team, Erik Blachford, was running Expedia and he was a founder, he was a builder. He kind of wasn’t necessarily up for the management gig, so to speak. So he spoke to Barry and he said, “Listen, I’m going to do something more entrepreneurial”. I was the CFO of IAC at the time, and I guess Barry didn’t have anyone better, so he tapped me on the shoulder and I certainly volunteered. I loved travel, I’m very passionate about it, and I took over what was IAC Travel at the time, and as the travel business went through some trouble, IAC decided to spin off IAC Travel into its own entity, Expedia. That was when I become the public company CEO, and it was a trial by fire. I have to say that the early years were pretty rough, but after a while I got the rhythm of it. Barry was the chairman and controlling shareholder of that company, and we built that company in partnership for many, many years and it was a really, really good run for me. What surprised you most about your time at Expedia and the travel business? Was it always clear to you and Barry that this Internet dynamic, where the power is actually going to flow to an asset-lite discovery tool, you marshal all the demand and then supply comes onto your platform, a real inversion of the physical world. Was that clear, or were you discovering that along the way? DK: I think we saw some patterns forming, and I would say the most important model that we saw was actually Ticketmaster. Ticketmaster, if you remember the olden days, Ticketmaster obviously was amalgamating ticketing all over the world, and was selling through two channels, which were the Tower Records physical tickets, and then by phone you’d have to call 1-800-Ticketmaster and wait on the line for two hours to get your Madonna tickets. They opened up a website, and very, very quickly we saw traffic move over to the web. So for us then, at the time, fulfillment on the Internet was a real challenge. We kind of thought, “Well, what looks like Ticketmaster in that it has advanced reservations, booked either in person or through the phone, of a virtual good that didn’t need fulfillment”. Amazon hadn’t demonstrated the incredible capacity to use capital and use incredible skill to build the fulfillment network that I’m kind of a part of now. And so, the model, when you think about that, virtual goods, advanced reservation, no fulfillment needed, physical channel, phone channel, maybe moving onto the Internet, it looked like travel. It’s interesting you mention Amazon, because you had the similar idea to Jeff Bezos, who wasn’t looking to do books specifically he was looking at, “What is the right industry for this new Internet-enabled model?”, but he wanted to do the fulfillment part. But it’s interesting, it’s a similar story where you had a thesis and you were looking for an industry that fit the thesis. DK: Listen, same thing with dating, right? In the olden days on dating, you would call up and you would put your profile on the phone and other people would listen. So again, we were looking for these virtual-type goods and the opportunity to amalgamate a bunch of content in a much, much better way as it related to the Internet, and we found some of the early players, the Expedias of the world, the Hotels.com of the world, the Hotwires of the world. Back then, Barry is a terrific deal person, and I was leading deals for him, so our way of expanding into the category was through acquisition, and we got to see it early. And really, people talk about history not repeating itself as rhyming, Expedia was a rhyme of Ticketmaster, of Match.com, and we just used that patterning to make some early calls in what turned out to be a terrific opportunity for us. By that time, was supply already coming onto the platform organically? Or was there a lot of work to be done in actually signing up hotels and whatnot? DK: Oh, it was a huge amount of work to be done. And the business — actually the Expedia business developed mostly on the air side, so air tickets. Yeah. Easy to deal with, so it was actually easier to sign them up. DK: Exactly. It’s interesting. You start with them, but that meant your margins were worse because you weren’t dealing with that many entities. DK: Totally, and you had industrial switches like Amadeus and Sabre to plug into. Yep. DK: Older APIs, but you could plug into all of the content in the world very, very quickly versus hotels that other than the change, the hotels had to be a ground game, building out sales forces, going out and signing up these hotels, many of which were smaller businesses that had to be introduced to the Internet, they often didn’t have a website, etc. It turned out that while the early penetration of the business and the reason why or the biggest driver around online penetration was air, the business ultimately formed around hotels, because that was fragmented content that you can earn a lot of margin off of versus air that’s pretty consolidated, that relatively is a great eyeball attractor, but not great in terms of transactional economics. Now you just helped me summarize arguably the last decade of Stratechery, so it’s actually a great example. Were hotels on Expedia when you acquired them or was that part of what you worked on? DK: They were just starting to come on, and we acquired both Expedia and Hotels.com, so we had a player that was really strong in air, we had a player that was really strong in hotels, and independent hotels in particular — put it all together to form the new Expedia, which we took public. But the hotel business is the heartbeat of that business and is the vast majority of the revenue of that business. So you have a decade run there. DK: Yeah. You have this massive stock package that’s meant to keep you there for even longer, and then you left for Uber. What happened? What was the story? How did this develop? It was obviously — we all know what was happening on the Uber side, what was happening on the Dara side? DK: It was very unexpected. A headhunter just reached out to me, random call, and at the time, just like you, just like anyone, I was reading about all of the issues happening in Uber in the news. It was almost daily, the various challenges that were coming up there. So when I first got the call, I said, “Heck no, I’m not crazy, I’m not up for this”. But I actually talked to a friend, Daniel Ek from Spotify. And you realize that was eight years ago, by the way. DK: I know. It’s been a long time. DK: It feels like a long time ago. But I had one particular conversation that really shifted me, which was with Daniel Ek, who’s a good friend, and I still remember I was talking to him about my career at Expedia, how happy I was. And he looks at me, he’s like, “Since when is life about happiness? It’s about impact, you can have an impact on Uber, which is a really important company in the world that’s shaping the future of the cities”. And I think to myself, “Oh, my God, this is so obvious, I’ve got to take a shot”. I knew it was going to be uncomfortable. In hindsight, I didn’t quite know how uncomfortable it was going to be. Otherwise, I might not have jumped in. One big story about that is, as I understand it, there was this tense boardroom fight to even select you. DK: Yes. Travis Kalanick supported you, even though you’re like, “You’re not going to be a part of the company”. Was he just trying to get back at Benchmark, or did you just sit down and talk to him and sell him on your vision? DK: I still to this day don’t know exactly what went down at the board. I believe that there were two other candidates. I think it was Meg Whitman and Jeffrey Immelt, at least based on the news, and I think I was the third candidate that was the least objectionable to both sides. Right. DK: And since one side couldn’t win over the other, they kind of went with me, go figure as far as decision-making. But it certainly worked out for me, and I think hopefully it’ll work out for the company as well. You mentioned you took over Expedia from a founder. DK: Yes. And you were a Wall Street guy and then you were a CEO guy. DK: Yeah. And then, now you’re sort of the manager. Would you consider at that moment, did you feel that Uber was ready for that sort of manager? Could you have built Uber? Is there an aspect of maybe there’s some things Uber would’ve done very differently if Travis stayed? People still talk about this in the Valley, do you just tune that all out, or is it something that you think about late at night? DK: Listen, there’s certainly lots of them, could-have-been, would-have-been scenarios. My experience at Expedia taught me how to be an operator. I went through a period where I was a CEO of the holding company, but also running Expedia.com, and that taught me operations, and my background on Wall Street, that taught me a lot about capital allocation, etc. So I think that training really prepared me to come onto Uber and be the on-the-ground technical operator that the company needed, but also understand governance, understand capital allocation, etc. I have a huge amount of respect for Travis and the founding team, because it wasn’t just him who built the company, and they had to take a very aggressive stance as it related to regulations, the taxi unions, etc., and they had to bust through an enormous amount of resistance. I do think that at some point the company got so big and powerful, but was still undertaking, call it upstart tactics, and they weren’t able to make that adjustment, which is, “Hey, we’re no longer an upstart, we now have millions of drivers, it comes with responsibility, we have to have different kinds of discussions with regulators, etc.” — and I think I brought that maturity, in hindsight. You got some really powerful tools to negotiate with cities and governments, which is you have millions of riders and drivers, people depend on you, Travis built those tools. Maybe he wasn’t quite wielding them correctly, so if you have to zoom out, the transition in that regard does make sense. DK: Listen, the handover at the time, it was a difficult time, it wasn’t pleasant. But I got to take over a company that was in some ways in crisis, but a business model and a brand and a very talented team that was just terrific. So while the handover wasn’t pleasant, I’m very thankful for having the opportunity, and I think it will all worked out. So when you came to Uber, I immediately drew a connection between Expedia and Uber, and in this aspect of aggregating demand. And yet, when you talk about Uber now, you were just talking about it in the latest investor meeting, you talk about how Uber is supply-led, and that makes sense when you recall all the fights for drivers with your competitors. Was that a mental shift when you got on the ground, you’re like, “Actually, this is a two-sided network, but maybe the network works a little differently than I expected”? DK: It was definitely a learning. Expedia is an Aggregator, and you need to obviously match supply and demand, but the nature of the supply to Expedia is much more static. When you compare that to Uber, the supply-demand dynamics are so much more dynamic. The ability then, or the necessity to balance supply and demand in a real-time geospatial manner, is just a much bigger challenge. Uber, to some extent, it’s unique as a retailer, which is when we sell something we actually don’t even know — when we sell and price a ride, not knowing what our inventory is — we have to guess the inventory, predict what the inventory is. Every time we do a scan of the marketplace, it’s just a much more complex beast. I did see with Uber it being all about supply, which is as we aggregated supply, ETAs came down, surge came down, the service got better. To some extent, while it’s a simplification, the service sold itself. I do think in hindsight, if I think back to the Expedia days, one of the things that Booking.com, who was a competitor, who is a competitor with Expedia, got more right is that they were very supply-led. Yup. They were on the ground going to all those little hotels. DK: Exactly. Famously, Europe is much more fragmented than the US. DK: Totally. If I could do it all over again, a lesson with Uber is actually the power of aggregating supply. Certainly you need demand, but there are certain aggregation categories where supply brings demand, it brings more eyeballs. That, for example, is definitely true for us as it relates to our rides business, but even more so in the delivery business. Every single restaurant that we add is a new item to sell, but also the more restaurants we have in a particular search, the greater your conversion is. It not only brings in eyeballs, but it also brings in conversion. Those two obviously are multiplicative, which gets to be a much bigger business as well. We’re very supply-led as a company. I think as a manager of a big company, once in a while you get to learn, and I’ve definitely learned my lesson here. Yeah. This is one where I feel like this should have — it’s so clear to me now as you’re saying it. There’s always a bit about Uber that I couldn’t quite place it in the aggregator framework. I think this is exactly it, it’s this aspect of this is actually a supply-driven market, to your point. We’ve seen with Uber being supply-driven, such that the more supply of Uber leads to more demand, as you just said. Do you see a limit to that curve? If all Ubers were free, what would the world look like? DK: Well, you might get rid of personal car ownership, right? There is that. The question is what does that adoption curve look like? Listen, there certainly is a limit to the amount of supply that you can add to a network. We go through seasonal periods where demand is 35% of the peak demand. Let’s say in most markets, March, early in the year is peak demand, and then over the summer you kind of have the summer doldrums, demand goes down, and we actually have to slough off supply, this is a very simplistic picture. The key for us is to add supply over a long period of time, and then be able to push up supply or pull down supply, depending on the particular marketplace balance seasonally, and then based on time of day as well. That’s where the fun of algorithms of the matching and the pricing algorithms come in for us. How has the balance shifted over time? Are you still tweaking it between the price of the ride versus incentives for the driver and how many drives they do, and the non-ride? I don’t want to call it — not marginal, because it’s still marginal in terms of drivers — but it’s not marginal on a per-ride basis. DK: While the supply/demand dynamics are quite variable on a daily basis, you have these big cyclical characteristics that you see in the marketplace. Got it, so you can start putting in incentives, so drivers are coming on, because you know that demand is going to be increasing or whatever. DK: Generally we have an incentive pool that we are moving between — either the incentive pool goes to create demand or supply, based on the marketplace balance. There may be during rush hour the incentives go to build supply. During noon, let’s say, incentives may go to push demand. That’s kind of on a daily basis, but if you think about the big economic cycles, when I took over at Uber, we were oversupplied. Actually, adding supply was not difficult, we were looking to add more demand in terms of newer products, etc. Then, we went to COVID. Post-COVID, actually we were supply constrained. Biggest challenge was to get drivers to feel safe driving someone in the back seat with all of the fear and COVID, etc. With the government stimulus, a lot of people didn’t need to work right after COVID started settling down. Right. DK: That was a period of I’d say two or three years where we were hugely supply constrained, all of the incentive pool went to drivers. If you look today, the marketplace is much more balanced, and it looks like it’s moving towards being a bit more oversupplied, if you want to call that. The incentive pool on a macro basis is moving more towards building out demand and reducing prices for riders, etc., but these are long cycles and we kind of have this pool that’s typically constant. It’s not about managing a P&L, it’s about managing marketplace balance, both short and long term. We talk about the curve going down and people get rid of personal transportation, but when you talk about these incentives and going back and forth, that’s a commitment. It’s like, “I’m going to get rid of a car and take an Uber”, suddenly if the prices don’t feel reliable, because you keep on tweaking with the algorithm, how do you balance the daily versus the seasonal versus the, “We want to change how the way that people actually live”? DK: Oh, you have asked a deeply philosophical and difficult-to-answer question. Generally, one is we want to lower prices over a long period of time because that increases our TAM, the total available market size for us, I think thematically that’s absolutely true. Our flexing prices up and down in a particular market during a particular time is designed to maximize the reliability of your ride. Right. Reliability is more important than price. DK: Correct. ETA in four minutes, getting that ride when you want that ride. On a short-term basis, if you look over let’s say a 16-week experimental period, we can prove that out every single time. I think that the debate that we sometimes have is does surge and the unreliability of price over a longer term basis create a situation where people are less willing to give up their personal car? I think that’s to be debated. Every single time that we look at it, reliability of availability of inventory comes out on top. People understand the idea of surge pricing, they get it. It was an ingenious move by Travis and team to introduce that. I think it’s something that while we try to minimize is actually feature of the marketplace, not a bug. Yeah, and it’s sort of a customer education that happened over the long run. DK: Totally. You had the misfortune of having to manage Uber through COVID, but was there a bit where you have had the fortune of managing Uber in a world of high interest rates, relatively speaking, and this assumption of, “Oh, anyone could spin up a competitor” — actually, no you can’t. You have competitors with say, DoorDash and delivery, we can get to that, but there’s not going to be a new entry in the market. DK: The free capital period of the market was a really challenging time actually. For me as a manager, I managed a public company, return on invested capital was something that was incredibly important. That was my world, the discipline of profitability, etc., and I think it was one of the reasons why the board brought me in. To some extent, while the COVID experience and high interest rates made for a much more unfriendly environment for operators, they separated the wheat from the chaff. Yeah. It sucks to go through, but it sucks way worse for the weaker competitors. DK: Yeah, totally. At the same time, I would also tell you that overcapitalization reduces execution discipline. We will have engineers build out a feature, it’ll take three months, and it might optimize the marketplace by like 0.6% or 0.7%. That’s a huge win for us. Hugely celebrated, incredibly sophisticated algos to achieve those kinds of wins. Then, in the olden days, someone would just raise $200 million and just blow you out of the water. It didn’t matter all of the art and the craft of building the marketplace. Yes, it did matter, but it got lost in the macro of money sloshing around in the marketplace. I think the market that we’re in right now, appropriate returns on capital, etc., the consolidation of the marketplace, a bunch of competitors who are competing very, very aggressively profitable— Well, this is the whole thing, I was so mad about the whole 2017 era, because I had planted my flag early that there are meaningful network effects here, Uber is going to win. DK: Yes. Then, the problem with 2017 wasn’t just the management upheaval, but also your primary competitor in the US got a huge infusion of capital, because people were like, “Well, maybe Uber’s going to go under, we want in”. It’s like it delayed the inevitable. I’ve been gratified to see things mostly working out as I thought they would in the long run, it just took five years longer than it should have. DK: Value creation was in money raising, not spending it wisely. Now it’s the other way around, which I think is the way the world should be. Yeah. Well, I think in a lot of this conversation we’ve actually laid down a lot of the parameters for — and I’m going to have to try to play devil’s advocate here because I am I think more on your side in the way the market’s going to shake out with autonomous cars when and if they come along. DK: Sure. You’re doing partnerships with different autonomous driving companies in different cities. Why don’t you give me your high-level pitch on how you see this market? Then there’s a bunch of specifics I do want drill down into. DK: Yeah, definitely. Listen, I don’t think it’s an “if”, it is a “when”, and AV is a huge opportunity for the entire marketplace. It is. These robot drivers are going to be safer. I think that they have the opportunity at scale, and scale, it’ll take a while to get to scale, to reduce the price per ride and increase the TAM of this marketplace, trillion plus dollars. We think it’s an enormous, enormous long-term opportunity. Now, a couple of things have to happen before that opportunity actually turns into commercial business. When I say commercial, I mean something that can pay back for itself versus spend a bunch of money. That was 2017 era, right? Is it the 2025 era in San Francisco? DK: Well, it could be. It could be, right? But I do think that the market has changed, and I certainly hope it has. First you need a consistently superhuman safety record. It’s not good enough for a robot driver to be better than a human driver, it’s got to be multiple times better than the human driver. I think the capacity for society to accept human failure is much more than machine failure. Yeah. You went through this early on. DK: Absolutely. Did the fatality in Phoenix, did that change your mind as far as getting out of the autonomous vehicle market, or were you sort of already on that way and that sealed the deal? DK: I think we were leaning that way. It was certainly a very, very important factor in our determination, but I think a couple of issues were more paramount. One is we’re in the middle of COVID, so all of a sudden capital was much more dear. We went from losing $2 billion a year to losing $4 billion a year, which is pretty scary. My job is to make sure the company survives, and this was a significant money burning part of the operation. The other issue that was a big one was that even though we were developing ATG [Advanced Technologies Group] to some extent separately, we treated them as arms length, we have the marketplace separate from ATG, the other players with whom we wanted to partner, like Waymo, didn’t believe us. They didn’t want to partner up with a platform that was also a competitor. It was a little bit of a fork in the road, which is either we had to go vertical or we had to have the platform play, we couldn’t have our cake and eat it too. Then the last I would tell you is Uber is hard as an algorithmic software, software and operations company. Beautifully asset-light. DK: Yeah. Hardware was not our superpower. At some point, companies have to know their superpower. There are very few companies in the world who are great at hardware and software. Tesla, Apple are probably two of the leads, it’s very difficult to pull off. The accident, capital, how the business was shaping, you either had to make a bet on vertical or platform. We wanted to make a bet on platform, and then just superpower, were the four reasons why we decided to get out of it. It reminds me of the Netflix story of they basically built Roku and then spun it out. It’s interesting, because you have a lot of the similar dynamics. They didn’t want to have to compete with — they wanted to be on cable boxes and on all the other sort of devices out there. In the long run, setting them up, I think, potentially to gather up their foes who try to go vertical in the long run, but that’s the wrong company. We’re on Uber, I interrupted your story. You said, number one, superhuman safety record. DK: A superhuman safety record. Second, obviously you’ve got to work with regulators on the ground and you’ve got national regulations, state regulations, city regulations to kind of clear a pathway and I think safety is a big one. How does that differ around the world, or is this where US federalism is going to be a big advantage, or are there actually countries that are going to be ahead? DK: I think that the US generally is one of the leads. We’re seeing the Middle East open up, but it’s going to be very inconsistent as far as how regulations and countries and cities open up. Obviously we are in discussions with all of them so that we can be a part of that launch going forward, but it is going to take a while. And listen, these are really important discussions that we have to have with regulators, especially on the safety side as to what’s good enough. So that is moving, but it’s moving slowly. Third is you need to have a cost-effective scaled hardware platform, and right now there aren’t that many, there aren’t those platforms that have the redundancy, that have the compute, that have, for AV, that have the sensor kits, etc., for AV. It’s going to come in three to four years, but right now, over the next two to three years, that hardware platform, you could say with the exception of Tesla, it doesn’t exist. Then fourth, you need great on-the-ground operations. This is an on-the-ground game, city-by-city depots, cleaning, charging, everything that you need to do on a day-to-day basis. And then fifth, you need a high utilization network that can manage variable demand in a flexible way. We think the best way to do that, and certainly in the early days, is a hybrid of this base layer of autonomous supply, so to speak. That is then, on top of that, you’ve got humans who come in and out during peaks. The great thing about humans is, while they will eventually be more expensive on a cost-per-mile basis than let’s say a machine, you only pay for their utilization when they’re actually working, whereas with an AV, you pay, it’s kind of fixed, so just like you see in energy right now, well, you need a base layer of gas and then the electric grid then can handle the flex up and down with some of the newer energy sources, the same thing is going to be true. You’re going to need a base layer that’ll be AV, and then you’re going to need variability to meet high demand periods, and that will be ultimately we think a hybrid network of AVs and humans. Yeah, obviously you’re the ones that have the variable supply. Speaking of the network possibilities before, I’m on board with that, I should be a better devil’s advocate here. But let’s grant you this, you are the Aggregator sitting on top of the stack. I’m very curious to think through what do those layers, some of which you just listed, look like. So let’s take the actual cars, is the software stack and the hardware made by the same company or the different company? How do you see that playing out? DK: Excepting Tesla, it’ll probably be different. So if I look at the stack, it actually kind of looks like the hotel business, I’ll expand that in a second. Or, let’s look at the hotels for a second. Right, you’ve got the brands and the owners. DK: Well, you have the demand layer, which can be Expedia, it can be Booking.com, it could be Marriott. Then you have the brands themselves, whether it’s Marriott or an independent, then you have an operator. The operators, these are teams, management teams, sometimes Marriott is an operator of a hotel, sometimes there’s actually these local management companies as well, that’s an operator. Then there’s the asset owner, these are REITs [real estate investment trust]. Marriott doesn’t own almost any hotels whatsoever, these financial partners own the hotels, and then you obviously have the financier. We think that same thing is going to happen in AV. You have the network layer that’s Uber, that’s Lyft, it could be Bolt, it could be Waymo too, they have the wherewithal of also going direct. Then you have the driver. To me, that’s kind of like the brand, which is the Marriott driver or the Waymo driver. Then you have the operator, the management company. This is us or could be Moove.io, which is a partner of ours. Actually 15% of our inventory today come from fleet operators that are on the ground in these cities, so we think we can move them over to managing AVs very, very easily. Then you’re going to have the vehicle owners, and then you’re going to have financiers as well. Ultimately we think OEM manufacturers, most OEM manufacturers are going to have different software providers providing AV sometimes on an exclusive basis, sometimes on an non-exclusive basis. A GM, Tesla are going to develop it in house, but then many other players are going to license it, whether from a Waymo or from a Wayve or other companies as well, so you’re going to see a bunch of models. As the business financializes, as these layers come up, the player who can drive the greatest utilization of these really expensive assets called cars are going to be very, very valuable, and that’s certainly the part that we play in addition to the local operations level. Do we have an OEM problem? I think one of the things that you see with China’s developing auto market is basically it’s starting to look like the computer market, where you just have these basic platforms that can be then customized and accessorized, and then software defined on top of them can be churned out. They’re much simpler. You can have very small ones, you can have very large ones, but it’s all like a recipe in a box. In the West we have all these OEMs whose expertise is around the engine and is building these integrated platforms that don’t scale down to a $10,000 car or $5,000 car or $15,000 or whatever the price needs to get to. Are we stuck, especially if we’re putting 100% tariffs on Chinese cars? DK: Well, I think that the innovation going on in China or in the OEM space is extraordinary. You go visit their factories and the people who work in these car factories, they used to work at Foxconn. You’re absolutely right. They manufacture phones, now they’re manufacturing- Foxconn itself is making cars. DK: It’s absolutely extraordinary. And they, I think, have absolutely taken a leap ahead of any of the Western manufacturers. Will the US have access to that content, if you want to call it that? That’s a question mark, but there’s no question that the Chinese outside of the US have a huge advantage. There are obviously companies like Tesla who have taken similar approaches, I do think that the US OEMs have to make that shift. One of the surprises for me as I’ve watched the AV space over the past couple of years is, five years ago, if you asked me as to the most important success factor in scaling OEMs, commercializing AV, it was actually the software, the software was the biggest challenge. The heuristics, the data, the modeling, the simulation, etc. It looks like there are many, many players who are going to make it to the finish line on the software. Now actually building scalable OEM platforms with the compute, with the sensor kit, with the redundancy that you need in the hundreds of thousands, that’s going to be the next challenge, and the Chinese players are certainly ahead of the pack there, although there are many players in Asia, in Korea and Japan who we think are more than up for it as well. Well, but that’s the problem, hundreds of thousands is a very big number for this space, but in the context of the global auto market, it’s not very big. Is there actually a bit where if the US gains this capability, it might actually end up being a new player? DK: I think that there is a chicken-and-egg question, and I think ultimately the market for this software is going to be in personally owned vehicles and rideshare. I think you’re right, which is if rideshare is the only market out there, it’s going to be subscale, but I think 10 years from now, every single new car sold is going to come with some kind of FSD software. Right, but what do you want from a rideshare car, I can imagine being very different from what you want from a personal vehicle, or do you think there won’t be that much difference? DK: Totally. Well, I think those are tunable. So for a personal owned vehicle, you may not have LIDAR, or other LIDAR is very, very cheap. For a rideshare vehicle that’s going to have a lot of miles where safety is incredibly important, a $300, $400 solid state LIDAR kit is absolutely necessary. The newer generation of AV software is looking like it’s much more generalizable to different hardware configs and different sensor configs as well. So I think ultimately you’re going to have platforms that the Hyundai’s of the world or the BYD’s of the world build, and there’ll be tweaks for personal ownership and there’ll be tweaks for fleet ownership, so to speak. I don’t think that’s going to be an issue, but getting to scale is going to take some time. Is there any concern where the US might be pretty forward from a regulatory perspective, but because we don’t have access to these OEM platforms, it actually ends up being the rest of the world that gets to this autonomous state first just because they have access to the hardware and we don’t? DK: I do think that the rest of the world has an advantage in hardware chiefly because of China and the US has to develop it, and today the US is behind. So you did mention the fleet aspect. Right now you have this deal with Waymo, take Atlanta for example, you are going to be responsible for fleet management. Are those going to be gig workers, are you going to hire them, or is this just a temporary thing, you envision outsourcing this in the long run? How are you thinking about that layer? Right now you sort of outsource that to the drivers for free, it’s a great model, but now you have to actually pay someone to do it. DK: As I said previously, we work with a bunch of fleet managers all around the world, and one of our leading fleet managers is actually going to be operating with us in Waymo, in Austin and Atlanta, so we will bring that demand layer. We’re going to really drive very, very high utilization of these Waymos. Waymo brings a software layer and obviously the brand that people really, really love, and then our fleet partner Moove is going to be operating these fleets locally as well, so it’s a team effort and we’re excited. I mean, we think this launch is going to be absolute dynamite. Is there a bit where almost your biggest risk factor is interest rates in the long run? Because in the short term, if it’s a Tesla or it’s a Waymo, they have to build out these fleets to even gain baseline capacity, much less even attempt to reach into higher demand areas. It’s all fixed costs, it needs high utilization, which drives them into your arms because you have the most customers, you have the cheapest customer acquisition, all these advantages that you’ve talked about. But, if suddenly they can develop the wherewithal to stomach losses for, I don’t know, I mean the Waymo share in San Francisco seems pretty solid right now where they’re not necessarily being fiscally disciplined, is that a real risk factor for you? DK: Listen, if you don’t care about economics, then business model logic, that doesn’t matter, but at some point you need economics to work in order to scale, and in a world where certainly if the cost of capital is high and these cars are relatively expensive, the player that’s able to drive the highest utilization of these vehicles is going to have the lowest cost of capital. The player who works with us is going to be able to expand into every single market very, very quickly, will be first to market and being first to market matters, and I think those two elements, which is lowest cost of capital, ability to scale fastest, are going to play to the advantage that we bring in terms of being the best partner for AV in the world. So we’re pretty confident of our position. But I do think this is still, there’s a lot of experimentation that’s going on in this marketplace. Any new market that’s developing at very, very low unit volumes with AV right now, I think people tend to kind of take those models- Over-extrapolate on them. DK: Yeah, over-extrapolate. Yeah, because who cares if you lose 20 bucks a ride on a small number of rides. But if you’re doing 33 million rides a day, well, losing 20 bucks a ride is a problem there. You’ve got to start making money. I have two questions on that. On these potential vertical competitors, I think the experience of Waymo is delightful. DK: Oh, it’s great. I took my first Waymo and then I had to go back to the Grand Hyatt at SFO, which the Waymo did not go to at that point, I’m not sure if it does yet, but instead of taking an Uber, I took Waymo to the edge of Waymo’s territory, and then I switched to an Uber. I think that the question is, of course maybe that wears off over time, you get used to it, but it’s nice to be by yourself. Is there a challenge where people already have the Uber app, that’s a big advantage for you, they can go to one app and they can always get a ride, and hopefully it’s autonomous, but if autonomous isn’t available, you have the human drivers to scale and it’s so much more convenient, or are you concerned that the user experience will make users multi-home in a way that they’ll check Waymo first and then go to Uber? DK: I think it remains to be seen. Ultimately, what we’ve seen over and over again is that the ride is a bit of a commodity. You want to go from point A to B, the feature is where you’re going. Well the more it’s a commodity the better for you. I don’t live in San Francisco, so it was not a commodity for me, but I talked to people who were like, “Yeah, you forget about it very, very quickly”, so I’ll digress. DK: And it is a delightful experience. And it’s nice being alone, it’s nice listening to your own music and not having to ask for permission, so the experience is absolutely terrific. Over a period of time, we think that the feature is where you’re going and the player who can, again, get you where you’re going in the way that you want to, reliably, at the lowest price, at the lowest ETA, is going to play a big part in the development of this marketplace, and ultimately we think there are going to be multiple players. Waymo is absolutely in the lead, they are a great brand. They are setting the safety standard for everybody, but what we’re seeing is many players are solving this issue, and ultimately there’s going to be a choice of taking a Waymo, taking a Nuro, taking a WeRide, or taking a Baidu RoboTaxi as well. That choice is going to come in for consumers, and I do think the Aggregator model certainly would be helpful for all of those companies to succeed. It’s hard for me to push you too hard, because this is my theory as well. DK: (laughing) We need a third person to disagree with us, right? Well, is there a concern that Uber today is Expedia in hotels? Supply is highly fragmented. Yes, you have the occasional fleet operator, but they’re small enough, you don’t have to necessarily treat them any differently, but in an AV world, now you’re dealing with airlines. The margin compresses, because you’re not negotiating against that many people? DK: Yeah. I think if you look at it, there are two ways of looking at this, which is right now, general take rate for us on a global basis is about 20%. We take 20%, we pay the driver 80%. If you just look at it mathematically, that means that if we drive a utilization benefit of 25%, we’re paying for ourselves. The actual utilization benefit that we see in the markets in which we operate early on is much higher than that 25%, so any player should take that 80%, because the benefits of, instead of a ten-minute pickup to the next pickup, it’s a two-minute pickup, the benefits of utilization more than pay for themselves. So, economically, we’re sitting in a very, very good place, and my experience is, over a long period of time, markets move to the right economics of the model regardless of supply and demand, short term. They move there, so from a utilization standpoint, we are in great, great shape. Now, that presumes that there are going to be multiple providers who are able to play AV. This is the third time you’ve anticipated my next question, which is if can we get to this world, which usually there’s going to be one player at the nexus of a value chain, and they’re going to garner most of the profits, and everything around them gets commoditized and that’s the vision you laid out. It’s a vision that makes sense to me. Does this mean, though, that actually your potentially biggest problem might be Tesla? Because you mentioned before, they’re going to be an integrated player from the car to the software. You can imagine Elon’s like, “No, you’re going to use the Tesla app, I think I have the largest bullhorn in the world, I can drive customer acquisition on my own”, and that, even if it’s reckless, and you’ve said you’d love to partner with them, I’m sure you would, but that is ultimately the, if not a threat, at least the airlineification, maybe more than you would like. DK: Yeah listen, no one wants to compete against Tesla or Elon, if you can help it. Their capabilities are pretty extraordinary, but I think the same economic laws apply to them. Ultimately, if Tesla puts their cars on our network, we already have 150,000 drivers who are driving Teslas, and if they get FSD, they’d love to plug it into Uber as well. Then, that Tesla that is both on Uber, and by the way, they could be both on Uber and the network, that is going to create much, much more revenue. Ultimately, that’ll increase the value of the Tesla so that the residual value of that car improves, and if they don’t do that, there’ll be some other OEM that does it. So it all comes back to revenue generation, you have a box with wheels, you want to maximize the revenue of that box in order to reduce your cost of capital, and economic laws apply to Tesla, just as they do to any other car company. To some extent, you look at the food business. I’ll go there, right? McDonald’s has its own app, and has an incredible brand, has a lot of capital, has terrific reach. They still work with Uber Eats and DoorDash, because they want to drive utilization of the box called the restaurant, that same economic value is going to be true going forward. Ultimately, we’re hoping that my charm and the economic argument gets Tesla to work with us as well. If they want a direct channel, no problem. Hopefully the charm doesn’t matter! I’m going to come back to that, that’s actually my last question, but before I get there, you mentioned the food delivery business. Uber Eats. DoorDash is leading the market. What would you have done differently looking back? Do you chalk that up to, “The company was in upheaval, we were putting out fires left and right, we were selling off businesses everywhere”, is there a world in which Uber Eats is in the dominant position, as opposed to being in second place? DK: Well, we always want to be in first place, and while we’re in second place in the US, in many places around the world, we’re the number one player. We’re getting much stronger international business. Hey, I use Uber Eats, basically every day. DK: I know. I’m very familiar with this. DK: I’m just saying, and we’re gaining category position in ten out of our top markets. I think last quarter, actually, Uber Eats made more money in terms of EBITDA than DoorDash. By the way, I could say the whole, “Changing your lifestyle”, that is the case in Taiwan. DK: It is extraordinary. The combination, number one, scooters are so much better for delivery than cars. DK: Yes. Number two, just the density, and the way Taipei is laid out is actually very unique. There’s no centralized area, so there’s food everywhere, and all the way around you, but the way the response in the market, there’s just a huge swathe of restaurants that don’t exist anymore, but they’re only on Uber Eats. It’s not ghost kitchens, there are some ghost kitchens where they’ve created for Uber Eats, but it’s like all your old favorites, their storefront is gone, but they’re still on Uber Eats. It’s been pretty transformational. DK: If the world looked like Taiwan, Uber Eats would be two to three times larger in terms of the frequency, it’s pretty extraordinary. But coming back to the competition against DoorDash, I do think that one thing that they got right was really focusing on the suburbs. If you look in the US, in terms of the suburbs, it’s actually 60 plus percent of the marketplace. Uber has always been a really urban market, we grew up in cities, that’s where we already had the liquidity of the marketplace, and Uber Eats was kind of — they drive people, drive stuff as well. It was an offshoot, so I think DoorDash got the suburban family first, we got the urban 20-something year old first. We’re now kind of coming into each other’s markets. DoorDash’s market, the suburbs turned out to be larger than the urban markets, but for us, suburbs and less dense markets, actually, not only are there a huge opportunity in learning for Uber Eats, not just in the US, but all over the world. We’re going into secondary cities, tertiary cities, but it’s actually a really big opportunity with Uber. As we started expanding Eats into the suburbs, we’re seeing that there’s also Uber demand there. So actually, moving into these less dense cohorts and neighborhoods, big, big, is a huge opportunity for Uber Eats, but also Uber as well, which is I think we got another three to five years of penetration ahead of us. You looked in the last quarter, Eats actually accelerated its gross bookings level, so it’s going to be a dog fight with DoorDash, but they’re a strong competitor. We’re a really strong competitor, and I’m very, very confident that the network effect that we have, Rides, Eats, along with the Uber One Membership program that’s now 30 million strong, ultimately is going to come out on top of the full competitive field in food and grocery. Was there a little bit of a paradox you just identified there though, where you are talking about, and the first thing you mentioned on your last earnings call, was the cross-selling and people that are doing multiple transactions across both Rides and Eats, but at the same time, did that make it hard to prioritize and focus, whereas DoorDash had an advantage by doing just food, and was that a meaningful differentiator? Is that still a meaningful differentiator? DK: I think it’s very difficult for companies to do more than one thing or build more than one brand. Not only are we multi-service, but we also expanded internationally much faster than, let’s say, the DoorDash’s of the world and many other competitors of the world, and on a short-term basis, it’s much harder. You’ve got to build more services, you have to generalize for the international markets. It takes longer to build things, but over the long term, we think it’s a much stronger strategic position to be in. Again, DoorDash, they do only one thing, we think our superpower is in the platform. Their superpower, you could say, is in their focus. Every piece of evidence that we’re seeing is that the platform is winning against the whole ecosystem. Obviously, the markets that we’re chasing are much, much broader than just the DoorDashes out there. So final question, you’ve talked a lot about in the long run, you believe in the economics, and so I’m going to dismiss your charm a bit. It doesn’t matter, sorry, the economics are going to sort of rule the day and bring this market to you, it’s going to be an Aggregator market, it’s going to be commoditized, all the bits and pieces of a vertical player is going to have to be on your platform to utilize their assets properly. Very compelling. Is there a bit where, when you think back to your tenure, you go back to 2017, and you go through all the controversies, that actually at the end of the day, I’m sure you did a great management job, so I guess I’m dissing your charm twice in this question, that Uber pulled through because its externalities are actually just so great and it’s hard to get away from? I mean, this is a kissing your rear-end question, but I’ve always been such an Uber advocate, I think in part because I came from a relatively small town, I come from a state with a lot of drunk drivers. There’s these aspects of being able to get a ride, there’s three taxis in the city of Madison. They’re always at the airport, and they cost like $100. It’s been transformational, and that’s why you got regulars on board in the first place. People loved you and they would go to bat for you. Is that the key thing? I mean, I feel kind of embarrassed. I’m asking such a leading question that’s so great for you, but it feels like the structural argument you’re making is actually, this is the argument for Uber as a whole. DK: It is, and I got to take over a great company. If you remember at the time, there was WeWork, and there was Uber, and we were both burning a bunch of money. WeWork turned out to be a bad business model, Uber turned out to be a great business model. So, while yes, were there cultural challenges, were there governance challenges, were there brand challenges early on? Yes, yes, and yes, but the business model itself, the service was a service that people depended on. We’ve got eight million drivers who are choosing to be on our platform to make money whenever they want, where they want, etc. It’s a very, very powerful platform that I got to take over, and I think the power is only multiplied during these seven years, and hopefully I can keep it going for a few more years at least. Until the next company is in crisis. DK: (laughing) I’m staying at this one for a while. At least I hope I do. Famous last words! DK: It’s a lot of fun. Dara, it’s good to meet you, and thanks for coming on Stratechery. DK: Thank you. Really appreciate it. This Daily Update Interview is also available as a podcast.

Title: Tesla, Intel and the fecklessness of corporate boards

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Sitting on the board of a large American company is at once the plummest and most thankless work in business. Plum because, when everything is going right, you pocket $300,000 a year in cash and stock for showing up to a well-catered meeting every month and a half. Thankless because you seldom get credit for things going right but take the blame when they go awry. And awry they go with disturbing regularity. Consider two recent events. On December 2nd directors of Intel sacked its hapless chief executive, Pat Gelsinger. He had torched $150bn in shareholder value over his three-and-a-half-year tenure at the chipmaker, even as the fortunes of virtually all other chip firms were boosted by white-hot demand for computing power amid the artificial-intelligence (AI) revolution. Good riddance, then. But what took the board so long? The same day, a judge in Delaware reaffirmed her ruling from January to annul the eye-watering $56bn compensation package awarded in 2018 to Elon Musk by the board of Tesla, his electric-car company. The decision is controversial. Tesla’s shareholders have minted it lately thanks to the soaring price of the company’s stock. In June 75% of them voted to bless the mega-paycheque (and move the company’s incorporation from Delaware to management-friendlier Texas). Tesla called the latest ruling “wrong" and will be filing an appeal. Still, the imbroglio is a reminder that Tesla’s notionally independent directors who signed off on Mr Musk’s windfall were, in a judge’s opinion, anything but. Intel and Tesla represent two ways in which boards fail in their duty to represent investors and hold management to account. The case of Tesla shows how directors at the mercy of a domineering figure—be it a controlling shareholder, an imperial CEO or, like Mr Musk, both—have a powerful incentive to humour that person’s whims even if it might mean ignoring their fiduciary obligations. Equally, as possibly happened at Intel, thoroughly independent directors may lack enough of an incentive to care. Either way, the result looks like feckless passivity. Certain features of American capitalism are making both problems worse. For a start, more companies are going public with ownership structures in which some shares are more equal than others. Jay Ritter of the University of Florida keeps a tally of businesses that opt for such dual-class shares. When Google famously did so 20 years ago, they were a rarity. In the 2000s they accounted for fewer than one in ten initial public offerings on American exchanges. In the past five years they made up more than a quarter—and nearly half of tech IPOs, from Airbnb to Zoom. Dual-class arrangements appeal to founders, who are happy to take money from public markets but not to give up control. Investors used to be suspicious. After Snap, a social-media firm, sold stock with no voting rights in 2017, some of them persuaded S&P Dow Jones, a compiler of indices, to bar new arrivals with multiple share classes from the blue-chip S&P 500 and its sisters. Many have since had a change of heart, no doubt impressed by the trillion-dollar market values of dual-class darlings like Alphabet, Berkshire Hathaway and Meta. So has S&P Dow Jones, which in 2023 rowed back its ban. In January Mr Musk mused about adopting the structure at Tesla, apparently out of fear that his mere 13% stake makes him vulnerable to be “voted out by some random shareholder-advisory firm". Investors may be right to conclude that a heroic entrepreneur alone can lead a company to greatness. But they should have no illusions about the resulting emasculation of their representatives in the boardroom. This is easier to swallow when returns are healthy than when they are not. Just ask the shareholders of Snap, which is worth a third less today than at its IPO. The rise of emasculated directors is coinciding with that of absentee ones. Most are physically present at board meetings but, like at Intel, too many appear disengaged. In the latest annual survey by PwC, a consultancy, only 30% of executives rated their board’s performance as good or excellent. A fifth thought it poor. Most telling of all, 84% of executives did not think that directors overstepped the boundaries between themselves and management. Often this is precisely what a vigilant board ought to do. One reason for directors’ disengagement may be overcommitment. This was brutally exposed by covid-19, when boards often convened weekly rather than every seven weeks or so. A subsequent backlash against “overboarding" forced many directors to split their time between fewer companies. The typical busy S&P 500 director now sits on two boards, manageable in non-pandemic times. But this has been offset by the rising number of hours they spend on board duties as the world gets more complicated. Directors’ rutCompanies are also finding it harder to recruit heavy-hitters who won’t nod off. A headhunter recalls that chief executives, a mostly white and male bunch, were out of favour amid the push for greater diversity a few years ago. “Now that is the only thing companies want." With the share of active or former chief executives on S&P 500 boards in decline over the past few years, many won’t get it. There is no recipe for a perfect board. But some ingredients may make them better. Lucian Bebchuk of Harvard Law School proposes “enhanced-independence" directors, whose dismissal by an imperious boss can be vetoed by minority shareholders. A version of this exists in Britain and Israel. And whereas a board’s size or average age seems not to affect investor returns, S&P 500 firms with a wider age range tend to do better. Expedia’s eldest director, Barry Diller, a media baron, is 55 years older than the youngest, Alex Wang, an AI billionaire. Perhaps intergenerational tiffs keep everyone else on boards alert.

The newly delivered spacecraft, designated W-3, will be instrumental in Varda's next orbital manufacturing and hypersonic reentry mission. Earlier this month, W-2 was launched and is currently operational in orbit, carrying payloads from the Air Force Research Laboratory and NASA's Ames Research Center. W-2's mission is focused on expanding Varda's pharmaceutical processing capabilities in microgravity before reentering and landing in South Australia. Built upon Rocket Lab's Pioneer platform, W-3 integrates a range of advanced, vertically integrated spacecraft components, including propulsion systems, flight software, avionics, reaction wheels, star trackers, separation mechanisms, solar panels, radios, composite structures, and propellant tanks. The spacecraft is designed to provide critical power, communication, propulsion, and attitude control for Varda's 120kg manufacturing capsule, which leverages the unique environment of microgravity to produce materials and products that are challenging or impossible to manufacture on Earth. Upon completion of its in-orbit production phase, Rocket Lab and Varda will execute a series of operations to guide the spacecraft through reentry, landing, and capsule recovery at the Koonibba Test Range in Australia, managed by Southern Launch. "Delivering W-3 while W-2 is actively operating in orbit demonstrates our team's exceptional ability to manage multiple complex missions in parallel. It really highlights the skill of our team and the strength of our integrated spacecraft technologies," said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck. Wendy Shimata, Vice President of Autonomous Systems at Varda Space Industries, added, "By increasing the cadence of manufacture, launch, and reentry, we are building the foundation for a thriving orbital economy. Our goal is to decrease the time between missions until it's commonplace for capsules to bring products made in space back to people on Earth." The W-3 mission is slated for launch no earlier than March from VSFB. Meanwhile, Rocket Lab is finalizing the fourth and final spacecraft for Varda at its Spacecraft Production Complex and Headquarters in Long Beach, California.

The NASDAQ-listed company said it would ramp up evaluations for potential AI and high-performance computing (HPC) uses at its Corsicana Facility in Navarro County, Texas, citing increased interest from multiple potential partners. Riot's exploration of AI computing capabilities reflects a growing trend among Bitcoin miners to leverage their substantial power infrastructure and data center expertise for additional revenue opportunities beyond crypto mining. The move comes as mining difficulty on the Bitcoin network has reached a historic high, peaking at 114.7 terahashes when it arrived at block height 883,502 on February 10, data from CoinWarz shows. A "confluence" of on-chain indicators suggests miners are experiencing more "financial strain than before, leading them to find new sources of revenue," Jaehyun Ha, a research anaylst at Presto Research, told Decrypt. Meanwhile, revenue from Bitcoin mining hardware has significantly dropped over the year, to as low as $10.4 a day over an operating margin of 60% for an average ASIC unit like the Antminer S21+ Hydro, according to data from Hashrate Index. Alongside its AI explorations, Riot appointed three new directors with relevant expertise: Hut 8 Mining CEO Jaime Leverton, former Meta senior engineer Doug Mouton, and real estate investment veteran Michael Turner. Moving in to explore AI and high-performance computing is part of Riot's initiatives to "maximize value" for its "entire portfolio of assets," Riot CEO Jason Les said in a statement. Similar strategic shifts by other major crypto mining operators are at play. Leverton, who just joined Riot's board, previously led her company's expansion into HPC by acquiring TeraGo's data center business. Companies such as Hut 8 and Core Scientific are repurposing their infrastructure for AI workloads, leveraging existing power access and data centers. These diversification moves are also aimed at reducing dependence on Bitcoin's price fluctuations while capitalizing on the growing demand for AI computing resources. However, the company cautioned there's no guarantee its assets are suitable for AI/HPC conversion or that partnerships can be negotiated on favorable terms. Still, Bitcoin mining and other public crypto firms are beating the market, with their overall market cap expanding by 14% to bring their valuations to $108 billion, according to JPMorgan. Riot also operates Bitcoin mining facilities in Rockdale, Texas, and Kentucky, along with electrical switchgear engineering operations in Colorado. The company's stock, which trades on the NASDAQ under the ticker RIOT, is up 0.2% on the day to $11.16, Google Finance data shows.

"This launch represents a major inflection point for our global defense and intelligence customer base as BlackSky introduces very high-resolution Gen-3 capabilities to our high-frequency, low-latency monitoring constellation," said Brian O'Toole, BlackSky CEO. "As more Gen-3 satellites complete production, we expect a regular cadence of additional launches over the coming year." Rocket Lab's Electron launch vehicle will deploy the Gen-3 satellite, continuing the long-standing collaboration between the two companies. "Electron is a trusted and reliable constellation builder for companies like BlackSky, allowing them to be in control of how, when, and where to deploy their constellation," said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck. "BlackSky is one of our earliest and longest-standing commercial satellite customers, and it's great to be heading back to the pad with them once again to continue to advance and expand their constellation." The ongoing deployment of Gen-3 satellites will enhance BlackSky's constellation, ensuring greater imaging capacity and operational flexibility. With these upgrades, BlackSky customers will be able to leverage automated tools for detecting, identifying, and classifying various objects of interest, including vehicles, aircraft, and vessels.

Title: Spain’s Olive Oil Prices Fall Over 50%: Good News for Shoppers, Bad for Farmers

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/12/2025 5:10:13 PM PST by nickcarraway Spain, the world’s largest producer of olive oil, has seen a significant drop in prices, with costs falling by 55 per cent in the past year, according to The Spanish Ministry of Agriculture. While this is welcome news for olive oil consumers, the sharp decline raises concerns for olive oil producers who rely on stable pricing to sustain their businesses. Why are olive oil prices falling in Spain again? The price drop comes after two years of record highs due to extreme droughts that severely impacted harvests. However, a wetter winter and a return to normal temperatures last spring have resulted in higher-than-average olive oil production, according to the International Olive Oil Council (IOC). Spain’s olive oil output is expected to reach 1.4 million tonnes this season, a significant increase from 850,000 tonnes last year. The Spanish Ministry of Agriculture has reported that since September 2024, olive oil producer prices have fallen consistently. As of late January 2025, 100 kilograms of olive oil cost €381.89, marking a 44.9 per cent decrease since the start of the season and a 54.7 per cent drop compared to the same period last year. Olive oil farmers and producers Despite the relief for consumers, the price collapse is putting significant pressure on farmers and producers. Many small and medium-sized producers, particularly in Andalucía, where the majority of Spain’s olive oil is produced, are struggling to cover costs. If prices continue to fall, some farmers may be forced to cut production or leave the industry altogether. Walter Zanre, UK managing director of the renowned Filippo Berio brand, stated: “We were really struggling to source quality olive oil last year. Now that the new season oils have arrived, prices have fallen significantly.” Full reduction of wholesale olive oil prices does not reach supermarket shoppers Although producer prices have dropped dramatically, supermarket prices have not fallen at the same rate, funny that. According to consumer organisation FACUA, while wholesale prices have more than halved, retail prices have only decreased by 24 per cent in the past year. A one-litre bottle of olive oil, which cost €12.88 last year, now averages €9.79 – a €3.09 reduction. Meanwhile, at the production level, the price per litre has dropped by over €4, according to a report by In Spain News. Experts say this is because supermarkets are still selling older stock bought at higher prices. Consumers should expect further price reductions in the coming months as new supplies enter the market – rejoice! While the current trend suggests more affordable olive oil in the near future, the industry remains vulnerable to climate conditions and global market fluctuations. The IOC predicts that better harvests across Spain, Greece, Portugal, and Tunisia will help stabilise supply, but producers warn that prolonged low prices could threaten the long-term sustainability of the industry.

Why are olive oil prices falling in Spain again? The price drop comes after two years of record highs due to extreme droughts that severely impacted harvests. However, a wetter winter and a return to normal temperatures last spring have resulted in higher-than-average olive oil production, according to the International Olive Oil Council (IOC). Spain’s olive oil output is expected to reach 1.4 million tonnes this season, a significant increase from 850,000 tonnes last year. The Spanish Ministry of Agriculture has reported that since September 2024, olive oil producer prices have fallen consistently. As of late January 2025, 100 kilograms of olive oil cost €381.89, marking a 44.9 per cent decrease since the start of the season and a 54.7 per cent drop compared to the same period last year. Olive oil farmers and producers Despite the relief for consumers, the price collapse is putting significant pressure on farmers and producers. Many small and medium-sized producers, particularly in Andalucía, where the majority of Spain’s olive oil is produced, are struggling to cover costs. If prices continue to fall, some farmers may be forced to cut production or leave the industry altogether.

Many small and medium-sized producers, particularly in Andalucía, where the majority of Spain’s olive oil is produced, are struggling to cover costs. If prices continue to fall, some farmers may be forced to cut production or leave the industry altogether. Walter Zanre, UK managing director of the renowned Filippo Berio brand, stated: “We were really struggling to source quality olive oil last year. Now that the new season oils have arrived, prices have fallen significantly.” Full reduction of wholesale olive oil prices does not reach supermarket shoppers Although producer prices have dropped dramatically, supermarket prices have not fallen at the same rate, funny that. According to consumer organisation FACUA, while wholesale prices have more than halved, retail prices have only decreased by 24 per cent in the past year. A one-litre bottle of olive oil, which cost €12.88 last year, now averages €9.79 – a €3.09 reduction. Meanwhile, at the production level, the price per litre has dropped by over €4, according to a report by In Spain News. Experts say this is because supermarkets are still selling older stock bought at higher prices. Consumers should expect further price reductions in the coming months as new supplies enter the market – rejoice! While the current trend suggests more affordable olive oil in the near future, the industry remains vulnerable to climate conditions and global market fluctuations. The IOC predicts that better harvests across Spain, Greece, Portugal, and Tunisia will help stabilise supply, but producers warn that prolonged low prices could threaten the long-term sustainability of the industry.

February 12, 2025 19:19 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Title: LEDs, OLEDs, and Micro LEDs

The oldest and most basic form of a flat screen television is the LCD, or Liquid Crystal Display. A layer of liquid crystals is sandwiched between two layers of polarizing filters. When an electric signal is applied to those filters (that signal being the source to be displayed) the liquid crystals align in changing patterns to produce the moving and (where needed) color image. The full details on how this many-layered LCD panel performs these tasks are more complex than this brief description can convey without reams of diagrams. Eye-watering descriptions of the entire process are readily available on YouTube. But suffice it to say here that the actual moving and full color image is produced by this LCD panel. But the LCD panel itself doesn't have the ability to illuminate, so some form of backlighting is needed to produce a viewable image. In the earliest LCD TVs that backlighting was produced by cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) positioned behind the LCD imaging panel. But those lowly LCD displays were soon improved by using LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) for the needed backlighting. This improved on some aspects of the overall performance, but the stationary LED backlighting still didn't contribute anything to the party other than the somewhat important chore of making the moving images in the LCD panel visible! Consumers flocked to those early LED TVs for their relative ease of installation compared to the dominant CRT TVs of the day. But there were issues remaining and competition soon drove TV makers to improve the performance of their LED TVs. Two developments, in particular, made their way into the LED TV market: local dimming and quantum dots. The LED backlighting on an LED TV consists of a large number of LEDs uniformly spread out across the backlight panel. But in early LED TVs the illumination of this LED backlighting was fixed at maximum to offer bright, punchy images. Any reduction of that light level, as required by the source, was the job of the LCD imaging panel sitting in front of the unchanging backlight. But there's always at least some light leakage through the LCD panel. The result was compromised contrast and mediocre black levels seen by the viewer. But suppose we divide those backlight LEDs into multiple zones and process each of these zones separately, as needed, to respond instantly to the changing brightness requirements of the source. Yes, the LCD still produces the detailed image, but by adding variable illumination from the now active LED backlighting zones we can significantly improve an LED TV's overall contrast and black level. That, in effect, is local dimming. It's now widely used in LED TVs of any distinction. But not all local dimming implementations are equally effective. The more dimming zones the better, but this will affect the price of the set. Nevertheless, even a modest application of local dimming can dramatically improve the contrast and black levels on an LED TV. Another key advancement in many of today's LED TVs is the use of quantum dots. A quantum dot is a microscopic particle that glows either red or green (depending on its size) when it's hit by blue light. In a conventional LED TV, backlit by white light, the white must first be filtered to extract the red, green, and blue colors needed to generate full-color images. But with a blue backlight, assisted by the red and green light produced by the quantum dots, separate color filtration is unneeded. This offers the added benefit of a deeper, wider, and more accurate range of color. Effectively controlling all of these performance benefits to work together demands sophisticated micro processing. All of today's TVs employ such microprocessors, often with creative and fanciful names. These names might even include the tech catchphrase of the decade: AI! But don't get too excited; no HDTV we know of can yet ascertain the program you planned to watch and switch to it even before you can grab the remote control! Manufacturers have also generated a blizzard of names for what are, essentially, LED TVs. But there's another type of TV design that's genuinely different. It's OLED, or Organic Light Emitting Diodes. The fundamental difference here from an LED TV is that OLEDs are self-illuminating. They don't require a backlight. Since each OLED can shut down completely where needed, OLEDs typically offer black levels and contrast superior to those achievable by any other widely available type of display. That's not to say that the best locally dimmed LED TVs can't come remarkably close. With careful setup they can. I've been living daily with the 85-inch TCL LED TV I reviewed last year and have had few complaints (though the impact of sheer screen size can also overwhelm minor reservations!). But once you've viewed the most challenging, near-black images on a good OLED TV, in a dim or near-darkened room, the experience is hard to forget. The image on an LED TV begins fading when viewed at off-center angles starting at roughly 25-30 degrees. Viewers seated beyond that are unlikely to miss the loss of contrast. Some LED TVs are better at this than others, but none in my experience will fully challenge an OLED's "choose any seat" flexibility. With these advantages, why would anyone choose an LED TV? The answers involve cost, peak brightness, something called burn-in, and range of available offerings. OLED TVs tend to be pricier than high-end LED designs in equivalent screen sizes. LED TVs generally offer higher peak brightness levels, which can be significant if you plan to do most of your viewing in a brightly lit room. And even if not, program sources produced in high dynamic range might also offer more pop on an LED TV than on an OLED. If you watch a lot of such HDR material you might be happier with an LED TV. Leaving a bright, stationary image on an LED TV for hours will affect little more than your electric bill. But on an OLED it might well leave a ghostly trace of that image on the screen. This might fade out over time depending on how bright the image was and how long it was left on the screen. If it's temporary, this is called image retention. But if it's permanent, it's true burn-in. To be fair, burn-in can be avoided with a little extra care. It's never an issue with fully moving images, and today's OLEDs claim to be a little less prone to it than were earlier OLED designs. But even so, the fixed scoreboards common to video games and sports can be potential burn-in risks. And if you live in a busy household with the TV on for hours every day, and other users who might be less careful than you, a good LED-TV might be your best choice. It's also true that a wider selection of LED TVs is available at wider price points than OLED offerings. And not all manufacturers offer OLEDs. In the US, Sony, LG, Panasonic and Samsung do (at least as of this writing) but TCL and Hisense do not. But there's also yet another new television format you may have heard of. It's called Micro LED. In a Micro LED TV the active LEDs that produce the picture are so small that they're the size of a pixel. In other words, a Micro LED TV can produce the image directly. But don't get too excited just yet. Manufacturers working on this type of display can't yet make individual Micro LEDs small enough to function directly as pixels in popular TV sizes. As a result, such TVs are, so far, available only in jumbo sizes, at truly eye-watering prices, and likely only at very specialized dealers or direct from the factory. Samsung can sell you a 114-inch model for around $150,000 (that's not a typo!), though they were out of stock when I checked! For now, if the friendly salesperson at your local Best Buy or Costco claims that the TV you're looking at is a micro LED, it almost certainly is not and that salesperson is likely just confused. If and when they can make the pixel-sized LEDs small enough for popular sizes and at prices comparable to today's TVs, that could upset the whole television landscape. But don't expect to see them anytime soon. The full details on how this many-layered LCD panel performs these tasks are more complex than this brief description can convey without reams of diagrams.

But once you've viewed the most challenging, near-black images on a good OLED TV, in a dim or near-darkened room, the experience is hard to forget. The image on an LED TV begins fading when viewed at off-center angles starting at roughly 25-30 degrees. Viewers seated beyond that are unlikely to miss the loss of contrast. Some LED TVs are better at this than others, but none in my experience will fully challenge an OLED's "choose any seat" flexibility. With these advantages, why would anyone choose an LED TV? The answers involve cost, peak brightness, something called burn-in, and range of available offerings. OLED TVs tend to be pricier than high-end LED designs in equivalent screen sizes. LED TVs generally offer higher peak brightness levels, which can be significant if you plan to do most of your viewing in a brightly lit room. And even if not, program sources produced in high dynamic range might also offer more pop on an LED TV than on an OLED. If you watch a lot of such HDR material you might be happier with an LED TV. Leaving a bright, stationary image on an LED TV for hours will affect little more than your electric bill. But on an OLED it might well leave a ghostly trace of that image on the screen. This might fade out over time depending on how bright the image was and how long it was left on the screen. If it's temporary, this is called image retention. But if it's permanent, it's true burn-in. To be fair, burn-in can be avoided with a little extra care. It's never an issue with fully moving images, and today's OLEDs claim to be a little less prone to it than were earlier OLED designs. But even so, the fixed scoreboards common to video games and sports can be potential burn-in risks. And if you live in a busy household with the TV on for hours every day, and other users who might be less careful than you, a good LED-TV might be your best choice. It's also true that a wider selection of LED TVs is available at wider price points than OLED offerings. And not all manufacturers offer OLEDs. In the US, Sony, LG, Panasonic and Samsung do (at least as of this writing) but TCL and Hisense do not. But there's also yet another new television format you may have heard of. It's called Micro LED. In a Micro LED TV the active LEDs that produce the picture are so small that they're the size of a pixel. In other words, a Micro LED TV can produce the image directly. But don't get too excited just yet. Manufacturers working on this type of display can't yet make individual Micro LEDs small enough to function directly as pixels in popular TV sizes. As a result, such TVs are, so far, available only in jumbo sizes, at truly eye-watering prices, and likely only at very specialized dealers or direct from the factory. Samsung can sell you a 114-inch model for around $150,000 (that's not a typo!), though they were out of stock when I checked! For now, if the friendly salesperson at your local Best Buy or Costco claims that the TV you're looking at is a micro LED, it almost certainly is not and that salesperson is likely just confused. If and when they can make the pixel-sized LEDs small enough for popular sizes and at prices comparable to today's TVs, that could upset the whole television landscape. But don't expect to see them anytime soon. The LED backlighting on an LED TV consists of a large number of LEDs uniformly spread out across the backlight panel. But in early LED TVs the illumination of this LED backlighting was fixed at maximum to offer bright, punchy images. Any reduction of that light level, as required by the source, was the job of the LCD imaging panel sitting in front of the unchanging backlight. But there's always at least some light leakage through the LCD panel. The result was compromised contrast and mediocre black levels seen by the viewer. But suppose we divide those backlight LEDs into multiple zones and process each of these zones separately, as needed, to respond instantly to the changing brightness requirements of the source. Yes, the LCD still produces the detailed image, but by adding variable illumination from the now active LED backlighting zones we can significantly improve an LED TV's overall contrast and black level. That, in effect, is local dimming. It's now widely used in LED TVs of any distinction. But not all local dimming implementations are equally effective. The more dimming zones the better, but this will affect the price of the set. Nevertheless, even a modest application of local dimming can dramatically improve the contrast and black levels on an LED TV. Another key advancement in many of today's LED TVs is the use of quantum dots. A quantum dot is a microscopic particle that glows either red or green (depending on its size) when it's hit by blue light. In a conventional LED TV, backlit by white light, the white must first be filtered to extract the red, green, and blue colors needed to generate full-color images. But with a blue backlight, assisted by the red and green light produced by the quantum dots, separate color filtration is unneeded. This offers the added benefit of a deeper, wider, and more accurate range of color. Effectively controlling all of these performance benefits to work together demands sophisticated micro processing. All of today's TVs employ such microprocessors, often with creative and fanciful names. These names might even include the tech catchphrase of the decade: AI! But don't get too excited; no HDTV we know of can yet ascertain the program you planned to watch and switch to it even before you can grab the remote control! Manufacturers have also generated a blizzard of names for what are, essentially, LED TVs. But there's another type of TV design that's genuinely different. It's OLED, or Organic Light Emitting Diodes. The fundamental difference here from an LED TV is that OLEDs are self-illuminating. They don't require a backlight. Since each OLED can shut down completely where needed, OLEDs typically offer black levels and contrast superior to those achievable by any other widely available type of display.

I've been living daily with the 85-inch TCL LED TV I reviewed last year and have had few complaints (though the impact of sheer screen size can also overwhelm minor reservations!). But once you've viewed the most challenging, near-black images on a good OLED TV, in a dim or near-darkened room, the experience is hard to forget. The image on an LED TV begins fading when viewed at off-center angles starting at roughly 25-30 degrees. Viewers seated beyond that are unlikely to miss the loss of contrast. Some LED TVs are better at this than others, but none in my experience will fully challenge an OLED's "choose any seat" flexibility. With these advantages, why would anyone choose an LED TV? The answers involve cost, peak brightness, something called burn-in, and range of available offerings. OLED TVs tend to be pricier than high-end LED designs in equivalent screen sizes. LED TVs generally offer higher peak brightness levels, which can be significant if you plan to do most of your viewing in a brightly lit room. And even if not, program sources produced in high dynamic range might also offer more pop on an LED TV than on an OLED. If you watch a lot of such HDR material you might be happier with an LED TV. Leaving a bright, stationary image on an LED TV for hours will affect little more than your electric bill. But on an OLED it might well leave a ghostly trace of that image on the screen. This might fade out over time depending on how bright the image was and how long it was left on the screen. If it's temporary, this is called image retention. But if it's permanent, it's true burn-in. To be fair, burn-in can be avoided with a little extra care. It's never an issue with fully moving images, and today's OLEDs claim to be a little less prone to it than were earlier OLED designs. But even so, the fixed scoreboards common to video games and sports can be potential burn-in risks. And if you live in a busy household with the TV on for hours every day, and other users who might be less careful than you, a good LED-TV might be your best choice. It's also true that a wider selection of LED TVs is available at wider price points than OLED offerings. And not all manufacturers offer OLEDs. In the US, Sony, LG, Panasonic and Samsung do (at least as of this writing) but TCL and Hisense do not. But there's also yet another new television format you may have heard of. It's called Micro LED. In a Micro LED TV the active LEDs that produce the picture are so small that they're the size of a pixel. In other words, a Micro LED TV can produce the image directly. But don't get too excited just yet. Manufacturers working on this type of display can't yet make individual Micro LEDs small enough to function directly as pixels in popular TV sizes. As a result, such TVs are, so far, available only in jumbo sizes, at truly eye-watering prices, and likely only at very specialized dealers or direct from the factory. Samsung can sell you a 114-inch model for around $150,000 (that's not a typo!), though they were out of stock when I checked! For now, if the friendly salesperson at your local Best Buy or Costco claims that the TV you're looking at is a micro LED, it almost certainly is not and that salesperson is likely just confused. If and when they can make the pixel-sized LEDs small enough for popular sizes and at prices comparable to today's TVs, that could upset the whole television landscape.

February 12, 2025 18:31 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) securities between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until April 14, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit. Captioned Cronin v. Merck & Co., Inc., No. 25-cv-01208 (D.N.J.), the Merck class action lawsuit charges Merck and certain of Merck’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-merck-co-inc-class-action-lawsuit-mrk.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Merck operates as a healthcare company worldwide. The Merck class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck’s projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval development, such as China’s approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen; (ii) in truth, Merck’s optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality; and (iii) Merck’s ability to push Gardasil in China had materially diminished. The Merck class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 30, 2024, Merck revealed that in the second quarter of 2024 “there was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei.” On this news, the price of Merck stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Then, on February 4, 2025, the Merck class action lawsuit alleges that Merck published its fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results, disclosing that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 Sales Declined 3% to $8.6 Billion; Excluding the Impact of Foreign Exchange, Sales Declined 2%” “primarily due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in most international regions, particularly in Japan.” On this news, the price of Merck stock fell more than 9%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Merck securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Merck class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Merck class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Merck class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit.

Title: Egg prices shot up 15% in January as retailers limit customer purchases
URL: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/egg-prices-bird-flu-inflation-stores-limit-purchases/
Time Published: 2025-02-12T22:43:26Z
Full Content:
Watch CBS News By Megan Cerullo, Kate Gibson Edited By Alain Sherter Updated on: February 13, 2025 / 7:27 AM EST / CBS News Egg prices continue to soar — if shoppers can even find them in grocery stores. In January alone, the cost of eggs around the U.S. jumped more than 15% from a year ago, to roughly $4.95 a dozen. That's five times the overall U.S. inflation rate of 3%, Consumer Price Index data showed on Wednesday. In 2019, consumers could pick up a dozen eggs for around $1.54, but by last year the price had soared to $4.15 — a 170% increase, according to CBS News' price tracker of everyday goods. The spike in egg prices last month underscores the devastating impact of avian flu, which killed more than 40 million egg-laying birds last year. Including ducks and chickens, 148 million birds have been ordered euthanized since the current strain of bird flu, H5N1, began spreading around the U.S. in 2022. If there's any good news, it's that egg prices are at least expected to rise more slowly over the course of the year. The January surge "is likely a one-off," said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco. But that may come as small consolation for the millions of consumers who continue to grapple with higher food costs both at home and in restaurants due to record-high egg prices. The price spike in eggs is largely driven by the bird flu, which continues to hit farms and wipe out flocks. When demand remains steady for a product that isn't easily substituted and supply diminishes, prices tend to rise. "If you don't have a bird you don't have an egg," Sharon Linsenbardt, founder and owner of Barn Buddies Rescue and Sanctuary in Las Vegas, told CBS News reporter Andres Gutierrez. The millions of egg-laying hens killed by avian influenza can't be replaced easily and quickly, added Linsenhardt, who has limited sales to two dozen eggs a family. "High egg prices are due to the avian flu issue, which cuts the supply in the available eggs for sale," Columbia Business School professor Yiming Ma told CBS MoneyWatch. "If you have less supply, that drives up the prices." Egg supplies are likely to remain constrained as long as bird flu outbreaks continue, according to David Anderson, an agricultural economics professor at Texas A&M University. Anderson, noting a cultural shift that may be exacerbating the problem, also said he has noticed that Americans are leaning toward more protein-heavy diets, driving demand for eggs. "We have this nutritional trend, and as people incorporate more protein in their diets, that increases overall egg demand and sets a higher base for demand," he said. "Then when we get this supply shock, low and behold, we get higher prices." Ongoing egg shortages and rising prices recently prompted 24-hour breakfast chain Waffle House to add a 50 cent surcharge per egg, while some major grocery chains are imposing limits on how many eggs shoppers can buy at a time. Walmart is curtailing purchases of 60-count cartons to two per purchase "to ensure more customers can have access to eggs," a spokesperson for the retailer said. "Although supply is very tight, we're working with suppliers to try and help meet customer demand, while striving to keep prices as low as possible," the spokesperson added. At Sam's Club, a division of Walmart, the warehouse club is limiting the number of egg purchases to two per item at its nearly 600 stores across the U.S. As of Wednesday, most of Target's nearly 2,000 U.S. stores had eggs in stock, and the retailer only has purchase limits in place in its Hawaii stores, according to a spokesperson for the retailer. "We'll continue to monitor and adjust as needed," they added. Kroger, which operates about 2,700 U.S. grocery stores, hasn't imposed a company-wide cap on egg purchases, though some stores are limiting customers to buying two dozen per visit. Giant Eagle said it was selling conventional shelled eggs "at or below our cost across all our supermarkets" to limit the impact of rising egg prices on its customers. The regional grocery, which operates more than 470 stores in Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, is encouraging shoppers to limit their purchase to a maximum of three egg cartons per visit. Amazon-owned Whole Foods and Costco did not respond to requests for comment. Egg prices are expected to rise a total of 20% in 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Despite the rising costs, consumer demand remains firm and could even increase as Easter approaches, offering little hope for respite on prices. Two things have to happen for prices to ease, according to experts. The U.S. must contain the bird flu, and older chickens that are past their productive primes, as well as diseased chickens, have to be replaced. Exactly how long all of this will take is uncertain. "it's not clear that we've fully controlled the spread of bird flu. That's the first step, and it'll be a few months after that before you can breed and replace the laying population," Bryan Spillane, Bank of America senior food and beverage analyst, told CBS MoneyWatch. He expects it will be at least another three to six months before prices moderate. If restaurants continue to implement surcharges for eggs, that could eventually put a damper on demand. In the near-term, Anderson expects eggs to continue hitting consumers' wallets. "I wouldn't be surprised to see prices continue to go up, because we continue to have outbreaks," he said. Cost-conscious consumers can comparison shop among grocery stores, noted NerdWallet spokesperson Sara Rathner, but be aware that if price differences aren't substantial, you could eat up any cost savings on gas. Other ways to save on eggs include using store circulars, or buying them with a cash-back credit card. "Then you're combining multiple ways to reduce your bill," she said.

February 12, 2025 17:00 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The following statement is being issued by Levi & Korsinsky, LLP: To: All persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired securities of Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) between February 3, 2022 to February 3, 2025, both dates inclusive. You are hereby notified that the class action lawsuit Michael Cronin v. Merck & Co., Inc., et al. (Case No. 2:25-cv-01208) has been commenced in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. To get more information go to: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/merck-co-inc-lawsuit-submission-form or contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. either via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. There is no cost or obligation to you. According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this news, Merck’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day. If you suffered a loss in MRK securities, you have until April 14, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn’t require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

Title: While Tariffs Take Center Stage, Inflation Approaches Fed Target

Time Published: 2025-02-12T20:36:30Z
Full Content:
U.S. equity markets have fallen for two weeks in a row due, no doubt, to the uncertainty introduced first by the Chinese DeepSeek company which announced an uber-cheap AI model that initially sent Nvidia and other AI stocks reeling (NVDA down more than -18% in January’s last week; recovering about half of that in the market week ended February 7th).6 10 Microsoft (MSFT) shares also tumbled on the DeepSeek news,7 11 while Meta hit an all-time high.2 12 Magnificent 7 As noted in the next table, the tech heavy Nasdaq led the way down over those two weeks, but not all the decline can be blamed on DeepSeek and AI. Equity Markets Part of the markets’ nervousness stems from the uncertainty surrounding President Trump’s tariff program and the uncertainty surrounding his policies in general.3 4 Markets abhor uncertainty. Initially, markets interpreted Trumps 20% tariff threats on Mexico and Canada as bargaining chips that were unlikely to be implemented.5 6 But when the tariff threats became reality, markets became unnerved.5 They calmed a bit when those tariffs were put on a 30-day hold (bargaining chips – Trump style),8 9 but we are likely to see more market nerves as the end of the 30-day period of reprieve approaches. Then on Monday (February 10th), Trump put 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.3 13 While, in the long run, that may cause more domestic production, in the short run, the cost of construction will be rising.3 On Friday, Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) for January came in at +143K, lower than the consensus estimate of +175K.15 16 As we’ve noted in past blogs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) adds a number to the NFP every month because their survey includes large and medium size businesses, but no small businesses. That number is supposed to account for small business growth. This is known as the Birth/Death Model, and in January’s data release, that add was +126K.22 23 On net, then, the actual survey count was only +17K (126K+17K = +143K). Also of note, the U3 Unemployment Rate fell from 4.1% in December to 4.0%.15 16 Yet despite this seeming strength, it appears that the labor market is actually softening. Such evidence includes: Average Weekly Hours All the above data leads us to conclude that the “strong” labor market is now showing weakening trends that are likely to have a negative impact in the near-term. In addition, the latest University of Michigan Consumer Confidence Index retreated to a score of 67.8 in February, down from January’s 71.1 score. Of note, the Current Conditions sub-index got knocked for a loop, falling to a score of 68.7 in February from January’s 74.0, indicating a rising level of stress in the current environment. Our past blogs have pointed out the lags in the data, especially rents, used by the BLS to calculate CPI inflation. In addition, the media is fixated on the year/year inflation rate. As of December, the official rate of CPI inflation was 2.9% (that’s a year/year calculation).17 25 26 But for the latest six months, it has fallen to +0.9% (Annual Rate) and to +0.4% for the last three months.25 26 Clearly, with falling rents, the monthly rate of inflation is now running well below the Fed’s 2% target. CPI for January is due on Wednesday, February 12th.20 That should provide further information for markets to digest. One note of caution: January often contains automatic annual price increases, especially on the services side (like insurance premiums).25 26 So, the downtrend in the CPI could be at risk. Nevertheless, we still think that the Fed will be lowering the Fed Funds Rate at a much faster pace than currently priced in the market.18 19 And that means that long-term rates, as represented by the 10-Year Treasury Yield, will be falling faster than markets now anticipate. Currently, odds of a rate cut in March are down to 8.5% (was 16% before the NFP number), and those odds were trimmed from 65% to 57% for the Fed’s June meetings.18 Our view is that those odds are way too low, especially in this year’s second half. 10 Year Treasury Yield The DeepSeek AI model (AI may be much cheaper than assumed) injected more uncertainty into the equity markets, causing prices in certain segments of the tech sector to pause (and/or slightly retreat) over the two weeks ending on February 7th.1 7 10 Of course, the tariff issue, especially regarding Mexico and Canada, also played (and continues to play) a significant role in market sentiment.4 5 After all, markets abhor a high and rising level of uncertainty. Add to that the Monday (February 10th) announcement of 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.4 20 The other big data announcement was the Payroll Survey (NFP) which reported +143K (lower than the market consensus of +175K).14 17 23 On Tuesday, February 4th, the JOLTS (Job Opening and Labor Turnover Survey) reported a marked decline in hiring rates.5 21 Overall, the data showed a reduction in the workweek and aggregate hours worked in January to the lowest level in nearly five years. In our view, the characterization of the labor market as “strong” by Fed Chair Powell, and by the media, is likely a significant overstatement. The inflation news continues to be hopeful. While the Fed and the media are fixated on the year/year rate of CPI inflation (2.9%), the annualized rate over the past six months has fallen below +1% and to just +0.4% over the past three months.27 26 On a year/year basis (the one the Fed prefers), if recent inflation continues, the rate of CPI inflation is highly likely to be at or below the Fed’s 2% target by the end of June. In this scenario, interest rates will be falling, and the market odds of rate cuts will be rising.18 19 (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.) One Community. Many Voices.

Title: The Tesla Revolt

The company’s fate will reveal how strong the foundation of Elon Musk’s influence really is. Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. Updated at 4:52 p.m. on February 12, 2025 Donald Trump may be pleased enough with Elon Musk, but even as the Tesla CEO is exercising his newfound power to essentially undo whole functions of the federal government, he still has to reassure his investors. Lately, Musk has delivered for them in one way: The value of the company’s shares has skyrocketed since Trump was reelected to the presidency of the United States. But Musk had much to answer for on his recent fourth-quarter earnings call—not least that in 2024, Tesla’s car sales had sunk for the first time in a decade. Profits were down sharply too. Usually, when this happens at a car company, the CEO issues a mea culpa, vows to cut costs, and hypes vehicles coming to market soon. Instead, Musk beamed about robotics, artificial intelligence, and Tesla’s path to being “worth more than the next top five companies combined.” This is the vision he has been selling investors for years: Making cars—a volatile, hypercompetitive business with infamously low profit margins—was only the start for Tesla. Its future business will be making fleets of self-driving taxis and humanoid robots trained for thankless manual labor. Whether his vision has any connection to reality is hotly debated by many AI and robotics experts, but most Wall Street analysts put their faith in Musk. And he has, at times, delivered on wildly ambitious goals. Shares jumped again after the call. (Tesla did not respond to a request for comment; a DOGE official did not respond to an email seeking comment.) Musk gets the benefit of the doubt from investors because—despite undelivered promises, half-baked ideas, and forgotten plans—he has made Tesla worth, on paper at least, more than essentially the rest of the auto industry combined. His funders are asked to buy Musk’s picture of the future, and the recent enthusiasm for Tesla stock suggests they believe that his political influence will help him get there. Musk needs that belief to hold. Tesla’s stock price is the largest source of his enormous wealth and, by extension, his influence; if his plans succeed, that stock is also his clearest shot at achieving trillionaire status. Right now, though, Tesla’s primary business is still selling cars that people drive, and Musk himself may be the biggest reason that faith in Tesla could falter. For all of Musk’s ire for the former president, Tesla did very well in the Joe Biden years. The Model Y is the world’s best-selling electric vehicle and its best-selling car, period. The company has comfortably been out of its “money-losing start-up” phase for years. Although the competition among EV makers is heating up, the only individual company close to eating into Tesla’s market share is China’s BYD, which for the first time last year produced more EVs than Tesla did. Yet that competition can’t entirely account for Tesla’s latest, abysmal numbers. Last year, Tesla sales were down nearly 12 percent in the EV stronghold of California. And in Europe, where Musk is helping supercharge far-right politics, Tesla’s sales were down 63 percent last month in France and 59 percent in Germany. This is happening even as the rest of the worldwide electric market is growing fast; nearly every car company that makes EVs saw sales gains in 2024, some of them huge. Musk’s activism does seem to be turning off the affluent or middle-income progressive crowd that was traditionally Tesla’s bread and butter. Look no further than how the company’s new, updated Model Y has been received. Musk’s army of fanboys on X was as effusive as ever, but outside the hard-core Tesla bubble, the SUV was met with a flood of Nazi jokes following Musk’s Sieg heil–ish arm gesture at Trump’s inauguration. This type of reaction goes beyond that one car; the Cybertruck has a unique penchant for being the target of vandalism, and people appear to be making a killing selling anti-Musk bumper stickers to disgusted Tesla owners. In covering the auto industry, I can’t go a week without fielding emails from people asking for advice on the best EV alternatives to Tesla—many from longtime Tesla owners who say they’re ready to move on. In theory, Musk’s rightward turn could help him swap out traditionally liberal buyers for more conservative ones, who usually tend to be more skeptical of EVs. And it’s likely that EVs will become less polarizing along partisan lines over time as electrification becomes more common on new cars. Right now, however, even the deep-red-coded Cybertruck doesn’t seem to be changing many minds about the concept of battery-powered cars. Take a recent report from the EV Politics Project, a nonprofit group that studies the partisan divide over electric cars. Their study indicates that although Musk himself is now viewed much more favorably by Trump voters and Republicans, he’s not leading some seismic shift in how they view EVs. Nor is he obviously trying to get MAGA voters to buy the new Model Y. In fact, those who follow the auto industry closely wonder if Musk is still interested in running a car company at all. On that January earnings call, he offered only a boilerplate response about “more affordable” new Teslas coming soon; the word Cybertruck was not uttered once. He is, however, clearly focused on the company’s “unsupervised” robotaxi service. (Imagine Uber, except with Model Ys and Model 3 sedans, and with no humans behind the wheel.) He claims that Tesla will launch the taxis in Austin in June, the first step toward turning the company into the AI powerhouse that Musk thinks will make it so valuable. Right now, his AI ventures are separate, but he’s started mingling them with his ambitions for Tesla. Ultimately, his thinking—which he’s articulated in earnings and public appearances over a number of years—is that his roving network of autonomous vehicles can use their cameras to capture huge quantities of data, and those data can be used to train AI networks. In the immediate future, Musk wants Tesla robotaxis everywhere, as soon as possible, and sleeping next door to the White House could help advance that part of his vision. Critics have expressed concerns that his newfound influence could also help stymie federal investigations into Tesla, which are probing the crash record of the company’s “Full Self-Driving” technology and its claims about the technology’s safety. And his current political position could help eliminate one of his oldest foes: regulations. Tesla has long clashed with environmental rules (last year, a California judge ordered Tesla to pay $1.5 million over allegations that it mishandled hazardous waste), labor laws (employees at a Tesla plant have said that the company failed to pay overtime, among other alleged violations), and safety ordinances (the company was recently fined for violating California’s workplace-heat-safety rules at one of their plants). But the greatest roadblock to Musk’s vision of robotaxis everywhere is arguably America’s current patchwork of state-by-state rules and regulations for autonomous vehicles, which may allow self-driving cars in some places but not others. No federal standards currently exist, but creating rules favorable to the industry would speed things up—especially if those rules were tailored to especially benefit Tesla. Musk’s approach to Tesla’s future has more than a few problems that the rest of the self-driving-car industry does not face. Tesla relies solely on cameras and AI for its automated-driving systems, rather than lidar and other more advanced sensors used by competitors. Plenty of experts think Tesla’s strategy can never power true autonomous driving. And Tesla is already years behind robotaxi companies operating in many cities right now, most notably Google’s Waymo. Musk’s Tesla faces the rising threat of China’s advancements in AI too: Investors are noticing BYD’s autonomy-focused deal with tech upstart DeepSeek. And they’re noticing where Musk’s attention lies; as he holds court in the Oval Office, Tesla’s stock has begun losing all those postelection gains. The most daunting problem, though, may be the same problem Musk has always had: people. Even if he does succeed in tearing down the regulatory state for the sake of his own companies, who’s to say anyone will buy what they’re selling. Any power Musk has in the future depends on turning millions of people into Tesla customers. If he can’t do that—or at least keep convincing investors that he’ll be able to—he’s just another guy screaming online.

Title: Tech companies laying off staff are still hiring — especially in AI
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-companies-hiring-job-openings-ai-cloud-infrastructure-layoffs-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-12T19:03:29Z
Full Content:
Just because you've read about a tech company doing layoffs doesn't mean the company isn't continuing to hire. The first two months of the year have already seen many tech firms conduct or announce layoffs. While some may be looking to operate more efficiently, many have hundreds or thousands of open job listings. Backfilling the roles of laid-off employees or hiring more staff in divisions deemed a higher priority could build back head count levels in the coming year. In some cases, companies plan to grow their head count in the coming year, and one red-hot area many companies are bolstering hiring is AI, for example, and related divisions such as infrastructure and cloud computing. Here's a look at some tech companies that are still adding staff to their payroll amid layoffs. The workplace management platform is laying off 1,750 employees, or 8.5% of its workforce. CEO Carl Eschenbach told staffers in a memo he published that the company would "continue to hire in key strategic areas and locations" throughout fiscal year 2026. Workday is "prioritizing innovation investments like AI and platform development, and rigorously evaluating the ROI of others across the board," he wrote. Workday has 348 job openings on its website as of this writing. Meta is cutting 5% of its workforce, targeting employees it says are low performers, with plans to backfill those roles later this year. The company is planning to hire "in the priority areas of infrastructure, monetization, Reality Labs, generative artificial intelligence (AI), as well as regulation and compliance," it said in its Q4 earnings last month. Meta appears to be accelerating hiring for machine learning engineers amid its layoffs, according to an internal memo viewed by BI. Meta has 1,750 job openings on its website as of this writing. Stripe has laid off 300 workers, primarily in product, engineering, and operations roles. The cuts represent roughly 3.5% of the payment platform's workforce. However, the company's chief people officer, Rob McIntosh, said in a memo to staff that Stripe is "not slowing down hiring." Stripe plans to boost its head count to roughly 10,000 employees by the end of 2025, which would be a 17% increase year-over-year, he wrote. Stripe has several hundred job openings on its website as of this writing. Salesforce is reportedly laying off 1,000 people, who will be able to apply for other positions internally, Bloomberg reported this month. The company has not publicly commented on the matter and did not immediately respond to BI's request for comment. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in December that the company plans to hire 2,000 salespeople focused on selling its AI products. Salesforce has 995 job openings on its website as of this writing. Microsoft began performance-based layoffs at the end of January. Separate from the performance-based layoffs, the tech giant also made cuts across organizations including security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming, BI previously reported. Microsoft has 2,128 job openings on its website as of this writing. Layoffs can result in a domino effect in the tech industry — look no further than Mark Zuckerberg's famous "year of efficiency" or the CEOs inspired by Elon Musk's deep cuts when taking over Twitter. If that's also the case this time around, we could see other Big Tech companies carry out their own layoffs. At Amazon, for one, CEO Andy Jassy said last year that he wanted to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Google recently offered voluntary exit packages to US staff in its Platforms and Devices unit. Anat Ashkenazi, the CFO of Google parent company Alphabet, said in October that the company would be looking for "additional opportunities" for cost cuts. Google simultaneously expects "some head count growth in 2025 in key investment areas such as AI and cloud." And while Amazon and Google haven't laid out more explicit plans to ramp up hiring in AI, you can bet they're going to duke it out with their Big Tech peers in the heated AI talent wars. Big Tech firms have also made no secret of their ambitious spending plans when it comes to AI. Recent earnings from Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Google indicate their combined capital expenditures are set to exceed $320 billion this year, driven largely by AI investments. Jump to

A new study is adding to the growing body of evidence that Ozempic (NVO-1.22%) and other GLP-1 medications could help people cut back on drinking alcohol. Some patients taking a low dose of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy drugs, reported reducing their consumption of alcohol, according to a new study published Wednesday in the scientific journal JAMA Psychiatry. It was the first randomized, controlled clinical trial of the effects of semaglutide on alcohol consumption. The small clinical trial followed 48 adults with alcohol use disorder who were not seeking treatment over nine weeks. During the study, researchers gave half the group small weekly doses of semaglutide while the other half received a placebo. After two months, the people taking semaglutide drank almost 30% less, on average, on days they consumed alcohol, compared to an average reduction of roughly 2% among study participants taking the placebo. This new study follows observational studies, as well as anecdotal evidence from patients and healthcare providers that suggest GLP-1 treatments can help users curb addictions. Semaglutide belongs to the class of drugs known as GLP-1 medications, made popular by Novo Nordisk’s diabetes treatment Ozempic. These drugs mimic a hormone that interacts with a region of the brain – the mesolimbic system – to reduce appetite and trigger satisfaction after eating. However, the evidence is starting to pile up that this medication could help people with other types of cravings. The mesolimbic system overlaps with the brain processes that influence addictive behaviors. This overlap suggests that these medications may “modulate the reward-response pathways associated with substance use,” the authors of a previous study theorized. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know In addition to a number of studies, a Morgan Stanley (MS+1.54%) survey from last year found that people using GLP-1 drugs — among them Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro (LLY-3.00%), and Zepbound — reduced their consumption of tobacco. At the moment, Novo Nordisk is the only pharmaceutical company that is currently studying alcohol consumption in a trial that examines semaglutide’s effect on liver damage. David Ricks, the CEO of Zepbound-maker Eli Lilly, said in December that the company plans to test obesity medications as a treatment for alcohol and drug addiction starting this year.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the March 25, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” On December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with “2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,” the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo’s revelation. The price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo’s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo Nordisk’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Despite the turmoil in the stock market caused by persistent inflation, shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI+13.32%) rose Wednesday morning as the chipmaker’s earnings report highlighted a positive outlook regarding its delayed annual report and announced an ambitious goal for 2026. The AI hardware company is working to avoid delisting by Nasdaq, with a deadline of February 25 to submit its delayed annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CEO Charles Liang is confident that it will be submitted on time. The company expects to reach $40 billion in revenue by fiscal 2026, while analysts anticipated $30 billion for that period. However, the company lowered its fiscal 2025 revenue guidance, now expecting between $23.5 billion and $25 billion. This marks a decline from its previous forecast of $26 billion to $30 billion, while analysts had projected $24.9 billion. Moreover, the company reported net sales between $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion, reflecting a 54% year-over-year growth, although analysts had expected $5.89 billion. Super Micro makes hardware that supports AI applications. Last year, the San-Joes-based company went through many ups and downs. The SMCI stock thrived for much of 2024 and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498 as part of a frenzy over AI and related tools. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA+2.63%) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates the technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September 2024 when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Following that, its auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned, citing disagreement over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence. Looking forward to a fresh start in 2025, SMCI stock has risen 37% year-to-date and is currently trading at $41 per share.

Title: How Will Tariffs Impact You? Here’s What To Know About Trump’s Plans

Full Content:
From reciprocal tariffs to a focus on Mexico and Canada, economist forecasts and recent history both indicate that Trump’s trade policies will increase prices for American consumers. Here’s how. Consumers will start feeling the impacts of President Donald Trump’s tariffs soon. Trump this week started the process of implementing “reciprocal tariffs,” a 10% levy is in effect on goods from China, and while his 25% import taxes on Mexico and Canada were delayed until next month, they would also have sweeping economic impacts. Many Americans are left wondering: Who pays the price? Here’s a rundown on the history and impacts of recent tariffs, Trump’s proposals and what to expect when it comes to increased costs. And there will be impacts: Nearly all economists agree tariffs are a tax on consumers. If you’re wondering how to prepare for the financial implications, we’ve got you covered on that, too. Workers assemble washing machines on the production line at a Haier factory in Qingdao in east China's Shandong province. To see the direct impact of tariffs on prices, look no further than washing machines. In 2018, President Donald Trump enacted tariffs ranging from 20% to 50% on imported washing machines. His administration purported that the tariffs would protect American industry—and such a move did add around 1,800 jobs domestically, according to a study in the American Economic Review. But each of those jobs came with an average annual cost to consumers of over $815,000. That’s because the report found that the tariffs raised the price of washing machines and dryers (which were not subject to such a tax, but are usually bundled with washers) by about $86 and $92 per unit, respectively. In total, the tariffs cost consumers just over $1.5 billion annually. And it wasn’t just the foreign producers who upped prices: Domestic manufacturers like Whirlpool and Maytag raised their prices by nearly the same amount once their competitors were charging more, says Felix Tintelnot, associate professor of economics at Duke University and one of the study’s authors. And he said the price of dryers went up alongside washers to likely spread out the additional cost producers were facing. Tintelnot said while tariffs can increase the number of jobs in specific sectors, they won’t affect aggregate employment because the country is already near full employment (unemployment is at 4%). “You can get [a] reallocation of employment towards industries that faced higher imports before, but that’s going to come at the loss of employment in other industries, especially export intensive industries,” he tells Forbes. “We are basically trading off cost to consumers with the benefits for producers in the import competing sectors.” Anti-World Trade Organization protesters during a 1999 demonstration in Seattle. Tariffs have been a trade weapon in the United States’ arsenal since the country’s very beginning. One of Congress’ first acts was to pass the Tariff Act of 1789, which was aimed at protecting domestic industry and raising revenue for the new government. In fact, tariffs actually constituted the majority of the federal government’s revenue until the creation of the income tax in 1913. With more money flowing into the government’s coffers from the income tax, along with the spoils of major industrial expansion in the late 1800s, import duties became less critical. Still, after the stock market crashed in 1929, Congress approved the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which raised already high tariff rates and angered the country’s trading partners. Trade between Europe and the U.S. fell by two-thirds, worsening the Great Depression. Some experts also say it helped give rise to extremist ideologies in Europe. But after World War II, the world rejected “protectionist” trade policies like tariffs, and 23 countries signed onto the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1947, which later became part of the World Trade Organization. And we remained in that era of free trade for decades, amid rising globalization and corporations “offshoring” manufacturing to lower-cost countries like China. U.S. manufacturing employment peaked in 1979 at 19.6 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but by 2019, that had fallen to 12.8 million, a 35% drop. Americans’ anxieties over the loss of such blue-collar jobs had been brewing long before Donald Trump, as the manufacturing sector was particularly hard hit by the 2008 Great Recession. Enter Trump, who tapped into those frustrations with an “America First” pitch. LUIS TATO/AFP via Getty Images Trump used tariffs as a tool in his first administration, targeting washing machines, solar panels and crucially, steel and aluminum, key materials in an already pricey housing market. Former President Joe Biden kept many of Trump’s tariffs in place. But Trump’s tariff threats this time around are more wide-ranging and potentially damaging, economists say. Though the president’s latest threats focused on Canada, Mexico and China, he has previously suggested taxing all goods manufactured abroad at 20%. That would almost certainly raise prices for consumers, especially since manufacturers wouldn’t be able to avoid a tariff by moving operations to a different country. Still, Vietnam is expected to be a major beneficiary of Trump’s China tariffs, and some companies already pivoted to the Southeast Asian country during the previous Trump Administration. Apple, for instance, started moving AirPods manufacturing from China to Vietnam in May 2020. “If previously it was made in China, now it’s going to be made in Vietnam,” Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University, told Forbes in November. “That production is not coming back to America.” ANDREJ IVANOV/AFP via Getty Images Trump’s China tariffs are expected to impact a wide variety of consumer goods, from electronics to toys and shoes. Around 80% of toys imported to the U.S. come from China, the Toy Association trade group told Forbes, and around 37% of all footwear imports—totaling $9.5 billion—to the U.S. in 2023 came from China, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. And for millions of price-conscious shoppers who rely on low-cost Chinese retailers like Temu and Shein, the tariffs will also close a little-known loophole that allows merchandise under $800 to enter the U.S. without being taxed. Many electronic devices like iPhones are assembled in China, a core concern for Apple investors as its stock fell 3% the day before the tariffs went into effect. And despite his relationship with President Donald Trump, Elon Musk was the biggest, immediate loser amid the stock market’s tariff reaction early last week, as investors expect the tariffs to impact Tesla’s business and profitability. Though the tariffs on Canada and Mexico were delayed for 30 days, Trump indicated that they would be needed as recently as Sunday, and they have the potential to wreak havoc on a highly integrated North American supply chain. Consumers are already conscious about grocery prices, and the U.S. relies heavily on the two countries for fresh produce. Canada is the largest exporter of meat to the U.S. Natural gas and oil from Canada would be subject to a 10% levy, and oil traders and consumers would pay the price. The price of gas is likely to increase up to 40 cents a gallon within days of tariffs on Canada and Mexico, according to Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy’s head of petroleum analysis. Canada sends about 20% of the oil used by Americans. Tariffs on the two countries would also hit the auto industry hard, as companies like General Motors and Ford rely on Canadian and Mexican companies for parts. Experts estimate the average price of a new car will increase by $3,000, as 22% of all vehicles sold in the U.S. are imported from the two countries, per S&P Global. “The proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico are really quite harmful and would change how American firms can do business,” says Tintelnot. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Separate from tariffs planned for Canadian and Mexican imports, Trump imposed a 25% global tariff on steel and aluminum imports Monday. But the European Union vowed to retaliate, and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese sought an exemption for his country. And Trump began the process Thursday of determining reciprocal tariffs, though they won’t take effect immediately. These tariffs are straightforward in theory: The U.S. would place the same levies on imported goods that a country imposes on what they import from the U.S. But it’s actually more complicated than that, because different types of goods are taxed differently. Trump’s memo Thursday directed his administration to conduct a country-by-country review to determine the tariffs. Companies are likely to respond to tariffs in several ways, explains Lori Yue, an associate professor at Columbia Business School. One is building up a supply chain in the U.S., which “doesn’t happen overnight,” or they may lobby the Trump Administration for exceptions. But ultimately, they’re likely to just pass on the cost, which economists expect to tamp down economic growth. “Some of the products, especially the agriculture, gasoline and also the automobile products, this affects people’s daily life,” Yue tells Forbes. “They’re going to feel it stronger than last time.” Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images TOPLINE While Donald Trump’s 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada are paused for now, investors should be prepared if that relief is only temporary. The tariffs on China still took effect this month, and Trump may be emboldened to continue using the threat of tariffs as an intimidation tactic. Adrian Helfert, CIO of alternative and multi-asset portfolios at Dallas-based Westwood, recommends finding protection in small- and mid-sized businesses that have a more domestic focus, which are still broadly undervalued relative to large caps. He has his eye on U.S. defense stocks like Kratos, a manufacturer of military electronics and drones, anticipating that defense spending will be mostly spared from Trump’s threatened cuts to the federal budget. Another area of the market Helfert is bullish on is regional banks like Texas-based Cullen/Frost Bankers, which will benefit from decreased regulatory costs and more M&A activity and don’t have a large international presence. One of Trump’s tariff goals in addition to stemming drug trafficking is to pressure other American businesses to bring more manufacturing back to the U.S. and trade more with American peers, which will help smaller companies who already have most of their footprints close to home. Nicholas Galluccio, who manages the Teton Westwood Small-Cap Equity Fund, points out that companies comprising the Morningstar small-cap value index already generate 70% of their revenue domestically and are trading at a 20% discount to large caps, while historically they’ve fetched a premium. For investors more inclined to invest in passive index funds, the Vanguard Small-Cap Value Index Fund ETF (VBR) could be an appropriate option for shelter from a potential trade war. WHY IT MATTERS “The stock market cheered Donald Trump’s return to office, rising to new records after he was elected in hopes that his victory would signal a new era of business-friendly deregulation, but it might not be that simple,” says Forbes staff writer Hank Tucker. “Even economic experts who supported him downplayed his threats of tariffs during the campaign, but now that it turns out he was serious about some of those promises, the stock market could suffer. Regardless of how investors feel about his politics, it’s important to be thinking about which businesses will be more sheltered from trade restrictions with China if tensions continue to escalate and prices rise.” MORE Trump Says Looming Oil Tariffs Are Negotiable: ‘Depends On What Their Price Is’ Trump’s tariff proposals would cost middle-class U.S. households $1,700 in increased taxes each year, as projected by the nonpartisan think tank Peterson Institute for International Economics. So how do you prepare? Consumers can try shopping at discount or bulk retailers like Costco or Sam’s Club, and for groceries, consider your local farmer’s market, though increased demand could drive up those prices, too. If you’re a small business owner, it’s probably a good time to refresh research on your supply chain, taking tariffs into account when considering pricing.

Business FILE PHOTO: An empty Lyft pick-up area is shown in Los Angeles, California, U.S., August 20, 2020. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Lyft shares slumped about 9 per cent on Wednesday after the ride-hailing company warned that lower pricing trends from late last year are expected to continue in 2025, as it tries to match prices with larger rival Uber. The ride-hailing platform has been aggressively working on luring customers and drivers onto its platform by keeping prices competitive and launching new features that differentiate it from Uber. However, Lyft said on Tuesday that it saw prices fall in the fourth quarter and the trend has continued so far this year. It added that the company had to drop fares for rides and give away more coupons in the last few weeks of 2024 to keep prices competitive. In contrast, Uber said last week that it expects prices for its affordable private car offering, UberX, to be marginally up this year, as it passes insurance cost hikes on to consumers. "What seems clear though is U.S. rideshare is allocating more incentive dollars towards consumers, funded by lower incentives to drivers — ok 'if' done with balance," Bernstein analysts said in a note. Lyft said it had the flexibility to adjust incentives to balance supply and demand in the marketplace since it had a robust number of drivers on the platform. "We suspect prices will be lower for longer which will test the elasticity of demand for the industry," Needham analysts said. At least thirteen brokerages cut their price targets on the Lyft stock, a day after the company's fourth-quarter results, bringing the median PT to $18, as per data compiled by LSEG. Lyft on Tuesday forecast gross bookings below Wall Street estimates, similar to rival Uber's projection last week. Lyft's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio is 13.4, compared to Uber's 29.4. In 2024, Lyft's shares fell 13.9 per cent, while so far this year it has risen 11.6 per cent. Its market capitalization was set to fall by more than $500 million to roughly $5.4 billion, if losses hold. Uber's shares were about 3 per cent lower on Wednesday.

Palantir Technologies (PLTR+1.06%) is the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 to start 2025, soaring 50% so far this year. But the software company’s bright earnings prospects won’t be enough to protect investors from short-term pain as its share price eventually returns to more normal levels, some analysts say. The stock, which dipped about 3.5% to close at $112.62 per share on Tuesday, has still surged about 35% since the company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings earlier this month. And it’s up a whopping 350% over the last 12 months. That’s taken Palantir’s price-to-earnings ratio to almost 600, and about 200 based on projected 12-month earnings. The overall current PE for the Nasdaq is about 42. “The stock’s not made of teflon,” said Bob Lang, founder and chief options analyst at Explosive Options. Palantir is trading at about 150% of the 200-day moving average, which Lang called an “extraordinary” level that can’t last forever. “Eventually the rally will peter out as investors get exhausted,” Lang said. The company, which builds software for big data analytics companies, earlier this month reported revenue of $828 million for the fourth quarter — a 36% jump year over year. Revenue from the U.S. government grew 45%. Palantir’s projections for sales and profit in 2025 both topped analysts’ estimates. Palantir may trigger a selloff if it opts to sell new shares to take advantage of its current, much higher market valuation, Lang said. The could quickly test the $84-$87 level. However, even at $90 per share, there would still be an uptrend. Lang remains optimistic about the company’s earnings prospects. He said analysts’ estimates of 25% growth in 2026 are far too low as Palantir secures new work, especially from governments. Michael Rechenthin, head of R&D at tastylive, a streaming platform geared toward options traders, shared both Lang’s optimism about Palantir’s potential work for the Trump administration — and his caution about the stock’s immediate prospects. “Revenues and net income have been increasing quarter after quarter — but not by the rate at which is stock is growing,” Rechenthin said. He said he won’t be adding to his position at this level. In August, Palantir and Microsoft (MSFT-0.51%) announced that they were deepening their partnership to provide secure cloud, AI, and analytics capabilities to U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. Through the partnership, agencies will have access to Microsoft’s Azure cloud compute and large language models, or LLMs, including OpenAI’s GPT-4, through its Azure OpenAI Service that will be integrated with Palantir’s AI Platforms (AIP). Palantir’s products will be deployed in Microsoft’s Azure cloud for government, including clouds for top secret use. —Britney Nguyen and Vinamrata Chaturvedi contributed to this article.

Title: Ukraine's Battlefield Fights Are Messy. Its Political Battles Are Getting Messy, Too.

By Mike Eckel February 12, 2025 The mayor of Ukraine's capital city is feuding with the president. The defense minister is under investigation as part of a bitter fight over control of weapons purchases. Recruiters are struggling to get enough men to the front. Ukrainians are fighting calls to lower the draft age. And last week, two more towns fell to Russian forces, though the losses were more symbolic than tactical. Ukraine is struggling to fight an existential war of defense, trying to hold back the nearly 3-year-old all-out invasion by Russia. Exhausted and battered, the population has mainly continued to rally behind the leadership of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But fractures are appearing in the country's leadership and political class. How wide and deep they may become is an open question. Regardless, they come at an inopportune moment for Kyiv, as momentum builds for a cease-fire with Moscow, with Ukraine's main weapons provider, the United States, eager to end the war and diplomacy heating up ahead of the Munich Security Conference this weekend. "These facts tell you that the political process remains active in Ukraine even during the war," said Orysia Lutsevych, a Ukraine analyst at the London-based think tank Chatham House. "There is much hope that there could indeed be a cease-fire and that political competition will restart. It is almost like returning to normal life, to have elections and to have competition." War: A Continuation Of Politics By Other Means On the battlefield, Ukrainian forces have been on the back foot for months, going as far back as February 2024. Last August, Ukraine tried to change the narrative, staging an audacious cross-border assault on Russia's Kursk region, the biggest invasion of Russia by foreign troops since World War II. Kyiv hoped it would relieve pressure elsewhere along the front line and prove to its Western backers it was still nimble and capable of battlefield ingenuity. The West was definitely surprised, but Russian troops did not redeploy from elsewhere. Across the autumn and into the winter, Ukraine was forced to steadily retreat in multiple locations. Velyka Novosilka, a southern Donbas town along the meandering river valley, fell to the Russians as Ukrainian officials, on January 27, confirmed the withdrawal of the 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade. A few days later, Russian forces took control of the last remnants of Kurakhove, pushing Ukrainian troops west toward the city of Zaporizhzhya. Major General Mykhaylo Drapatiy, the new commander of Ukraine's ground forces, was ordered to take direct command of the eastern front, a move many saw as a possible indication of how worried commanders might be about defenses. Capital City Wrangling Back in Kyiv, Mayor Vitali Klitschko, a former heavyweight boxing champion, fired a public broadside on January 29, accusing Zelenskyy's presidential office of political intrigue with its choice of a new military administrator for the city. Military administrators have been put in place across the country since the onset of the invasion as a way to streamline coordination between civilian and military authorities. But the appointment of Tymur Tkachenko a month earlier had "political motives," Klitschko asserted, charging that Tkachenko was "interfering in and blocking of economic activity" in the capital. "I am addressing the president of Ukraine," Klitschko said in a video posted to Telegram. "While you, as the supreme commander-in-chief, are focused on the war and the defense of Ukraine, people around you are tirelessly engaged in political intrigue." Tkachenko punched back. "I am not inclined to organize political shows like people who have been in the city government for decades," he said. "We will solve the problems of the city and help the people of Kyiv." Procurement Problems The Defense Ministry, meanwhile, is embroiled in pitched bureaucratic warfare over how weaponry is procured for the armed forces. The Defense Procurement Agency was established in 2022 as a way to manage the flood of weaponry -- both from abroad and from within the country -- that Ukraine needs to arm its military. Previously, arms procurement had been dogged by corruption and graft. On January 31, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov dismissed the head of the agency, Maria Bezrukova, accusing her of mismanagement. Bezrukova in turn denied the accusation and claimed Umerov's dismissal order was illegal because the agency's supervisory board had extended her contract. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau, an independent law enforcement agency, then jumped into the fray, opening an investigation and saying Umerov may have violated the law by not recognizing her contract extension. The turmoil drew concern from the Group of Seven nations: "Compliance with good governance principles and NATO recommendations is essential to maintaining the trust of the public and international partners," they said in a statement. More Men, More Boys Ukraine's battlefield woes stem in large part from its inability to send enough men to bolster exhausted and depleted units struggling to fend off a bigger, better-armed Russian military. Despite passing legislation last year to overhaul the existing system, officials have still struggled to recruit and train enough men. Highlighting the recruiting difficulties is the scandal surrounding the 155th Separate Mechanized Brigade, a French-trained and -armed unit that was supposed to be a vanguard of a modernized armed force for Ukraine. Instead, the unit saw scores of men deserting; its commander was relieved of duty just before the unit deployed to the Donbas, and investigators are looking closely at what went wrong. Zelenskyy ordered a halt to the creation of similar brigades. U.S. and other Western officials have called for lowering the conscription age from 25 to 18. Zelenskyy has resisted, fearing it would decimate the country's already fragile demographics, making it impossible to increase the population in the future. Elephant In The Room Looming over all this is the prospect of peace talks. The Trump administration has signaled it will use a mix of coercion and inducements to get Kyiv and Moscow to at least sit down and negotiate. Among the issues on the table: whether Ukraine should suspend martial law to allow for new presidential elections, which have been prohibited since the start of the Russian invasion. Zelenskyy won a five-year term in 2019. A poll published February 3 that asked Ukrainians which public figures they trusted the most found that Valeriy Zaluzhniy, the former commander-in-chief, topped the list. Since being appointed ambassador to Britain, Zaluzhniy has kept a low political profile, but many see him as a strong contender if there is an election. He was followed in the ranking by Kyrylo Budanov, the sphinx-like head of Ukraine's military intelligence agency, and Oleksandr Usyk, who last year won the world heavyweight boxing title. In fourth place: Zelenskyy. Experts say Zelenskyy's political advisers are aware Zaluzhniy would be a formidable rival in an election. Since his move to London, most of the gruff former general's public statements have called for national solidarity in the fight against a foreign enemy. There's also the fear that Russia could meddle in any Ukrainian election -- as it has done in the past. Sergei Zhuk, a fellow at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington and a professor at Ball State University in Indiana, told RFE/RL in an interview last month that the Kremlin could use its powerful propaganda machine and pro-Russia elements inside Ukraine to destabilize the country during elections. Also lurking in the background: former President Petro Poroshenko, whom Zelenskyy defeated in 2019. Poroshenko's supporters appear to be laying the groundwork for him to run again, although he is still widely unpopular. "There was always this discussion about mobilization, the level of war-time tax, procurement process at the [Defense Ministry], building defenses around power stations," Lutsevych said. "There is unity where it matters in war: about the enemy, and that enemy is Russia." RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service contributed to this report.

Title: Best VR Porn Games to Play in 2025

VR porn games have taken adult entertainment to the next level, thanks to huge leaps in headset technology and production quality. Gone are the days of static screens, now, you can step inside the action with hyper-realistic 3D visuals, smooth animations, and responsive gameplay that puts you in control. Whether curious or a longtime fan, VR offers a completely new way to experience adult content, making it more immersive and interactive than ever. If you haven’t tried VR porn yet, now’s the perfect time to dive in and see what all the hype is about! To save you the trial and error, we’ve put together the ultimate list of the 10 Best VR porn games on the market. We’ve done deep dives into the top ten, breaking down what makes them stand out, and rounded up the rest as honorable mentions. Expect cutting-edge technology, jaw-dropping realism, immersive storylines, and erotic encounters that push the limits of virtual pleasure. Ooh la la! Is it all fun and games? While VR porn games offer immersive experiences, it’s essential to remember that they also come with potential downsides, particularly in how they can affect players’ socialization, relationships, and worldview. One major concern is social isolation. Because VR can feel incredibly realistic, some users may find themselves spending more time in virtual relationships rather than engaging with real-world connections. Over time, this could lead to difficulty in forming and maintaining personal relationships, as interacting with AI-driven characters is often easier and less demanding than dealing with real people. Another issue is the reinforcement of unrealistic expectations. Many VR adult games allow for complete customization and control, something that simply isn’t possible in real-world relationships. This can create distorted perceptions of intimacy, where players expect perfect responses, unrealistic bodies, or total dominance over interactions, which can lead to dissatisfaction with real-life partners. The Impact on Attitudes Toward Women and Femme-Presenting People Another potential downside of VR porn games is how they reinforce misogynistic attitudes or unrealistic expectations toward women and femme-presenting people. Many of these games prioritize male-centered fantasies, often portraying women as hypersexual, submissive, or endlessly accommodating without emotional needs or boundaries. Over time, frequent exposure to these dynamics can shape unrealistic or harmful views on real-life relationships. It’s possible that players may come to expect one-sided interactions that don’t require mutual respect or effort. Yikes! Additionally, some games promote power imbalances, reinforcing a false sense of intimacy that is inherently based on dominance and control, rather than consent and connection. While fantasy has its place, repeated exposure without critical thinking can blur the line between healthy kinks and problematic beliefs. For those already struggling with social interactions, this can potentially deepen resentment or entitlement, particularly toward women who don’t conform to these scripted, fantasy-based behaviors. Engaging with VR porn games doesn’t automatically lead to misogynistic beliefs, but it’s important to critically examine the content, challenge harmful narratives, and balance virtual experiences with real-world perspectives on intimacy, agency, and respect. But it’s not all bad VR porn games also offer unique social and personal benefits, beyond just entertainment. For some, they provide a safe space to explore fantasies, build confidence, and understand personal desires without pressure. Multiplayer games foster social connections, allowing users to interact with others in a low-stress environment. VR can also enhance long-distance relationships, creating shared intimate experiences despite physical distance. When balanced with real-world interactions, VR porn games can be a fun, engaging, and even confidence-boosting outlet. 1.

Try these: Choosing the right adult VR game depends on what kind of experience you’re looking for. Here are some key factors to consider: VR Compatibility Not all VR games work with every headset. Check if the game supports your specific device (e.g., Oculus, HTC Vive, Valve Index, PSVR). Some games also run in desktop mode if you don’t have VR gear. Level of Interactivity Do you want a passive viewing experience (like 360° videos) or a fully interactive game with AI-driven characters, physics-based interactions, and player choices? Graphics & Animation Quality Some games focus on highly detailed, realistic models, while others go for a stylized or anime-inspired look. Consider what visual style appeals to you. Customization Options Many games allow you to modify characters, outfits, and scenarios. If personalizing the experience is important, look for a game with strong customization features. Multiplayer vs. Solo Experience Some games, like 3DXChat, emphasize social interaction, while others are single-player-focused. Decide if you want a solo experience or a multiplayer world with real-time interactions. Teledildonics Support If you’re interested in haptic feedback devices, check if the game is compatible with interactive toys like Lovense or Kiiroo for a more immersive experience. Storyline & Gameplay Depth Some games offer deep narratives and role-playing elements, while others are more focused on quick, no-strings-attached experiences. Choose based on whether you prefer a story-driven game or a casual encounter. Common questions about this new and exciting erotic technology. Are VR porn games safe to download and play? As with any software, it’s best to download from official websites or trusted platforms to avoid malware. Always check reviews, system requirements, and privacy settings before installing. What do I need to play adult VR games? To play adult VR games, you’ll need a VR-compatible headset (like Oculus Quest, HTC Vive, or Valve Index), a VR-ready PC (for high-end games), and enough storage space for downloads. Some games also offer non-VR modes for standard screens. What are the best VR headsets? The best headset depends on your budget and preferences. High-end options like the Valve Index and HTC Vive Pro offer top-tier visuals and tracking, while more affordable headsets like the Oculus Quest 2 provide wireless freedom and solid performance. Many PC-based games also support Windows Mixed Reality headsets. Can I play VR games without a VR headset? Yes! Some games offer a desktop mode where you can play with standard controls and a monitor. However, you won’t get the same level of immersion as you would in VR. Do VR games require an internet connection? It depends on the game. Single-player experiences usually work offline, while multiplayer games (like 3DXChat) need an active internet connection for real-time interaction with other players. Are VR porn games multiplayer or single-player? Both options exist! Games like 3DXChat offer multiplayer experiences where you can interact with other players, while games like Dominatrix Simulator focus on single-player immersion with AI-driven characters. Can I customize characters and experiences? Many adult VR games offer deep customization, allowing you to adjust character appearances, outfits, and even personalities. Some also let you modify environments and interaction styles. Do VR porn games support teledildonics? Many do, yes! Some games sync with interactive sex toys (check out Lovense or Kiiroo) to provide haptic feedback, making in-game actions feel more realistic. Are there VR porn games with more intellectual or story-driven gameplay? Absolutely! Games like XStoryPlayer and Dominatrix Simulator feature narrative-driven experiences, where your choices affect the outcome. These are great if you prefer an interactive story over casual encounters. How realistic are the animations and physics in adult VR games? It varies by game. Some use advanced physics engines for realistic movements and interactions, while others prioritize a stylized or fantasy aesthetic. Games that support teledildonics also add an extra layer of realism with synchronized haptic feedback. Love them or hate them, VR porn games have revolutionized the way people engage with adult content, offering unparalleled interactivity, and personalization. With advancements in VR headset technology these experiences have evolved far beyond traditional adult media, and who knows where they will take us next! When enjoyed in moderation, VR porn games can be a fun, confidence-boosting outlet, allowing users to safely explore desires, improve social skills in virtual spaces, or even strengthen connections in long-distance relationships. The addition of teledildonics further enhances realism, bridging the gap between fantasy and physical sensation. Of course, as with all media, critical engagement is key. Some VR porn games reinforce harmful stereotypes or unrealistic portrayals of women and relationships, so always remain critical of your consumption. It’s essential to recognize the difference between fantasy and reality, boundaries and consent, and to balance virtual experiences with real-life connections for healthy perspectives on intimacy. Ultimately, VR porn games are a thrilling and ever-evolving frontier in adult entertainment. Whether you’re a casual player or a dedicated enthusiast, they offer a unique way to engage with sexuality, pushing the boundaries of pleasure and personal exploration. As technology continues to evolve, so too will the experiences available, making this an exciting space to watch, and play in, for years to come.

February 11, 2025 22:31 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Bird Flu: What I’m Doing About It, by Sara Sue
URL: https://survivalblog.com/2025/02/16/bird-flu-what-im-doing-about-it-by-sara-sue/
Time Published: 2025-02-12T02:05:48Z
Full Content:
The White House suggested, via the Press Secretary, that over 100 million chickens have died, or been destroyed, over bird flu. I noticed that the price of eggs has gone up exponentially, so I polled my group of friends in an online homesteading forum, asking what they are seeing. I also asked family members who live across the country. The highest price I heard of from a family member in California was $10 per dozen for grocery store eggs. Locally where I live, free-range chicken eggs are about $5-to-$6 per dozen. Eggs have been a standard for an inexpensive protein source “forever”. When people couldn’t afford to buy meat, they could buy eggs and count on that to meet protein needs. That is no longer true. The situation is fairly devastating for the population, not just chicken farmers. The price of eggs and chicken meat will continue to rise, at least in the next several months, in my opinion. Primarily because it takes at least two months to grow out meat birds and 5-6 months to raise layer chickens before they start laying eggs. Not to mention the cost and time of reconstruction after having to burn down the chicken housing, as is required in large chicken operations after a bird flu infection. The other price that has soared is the cost of chicks. I went in search of chicks to “refresh” my flock, something I like to do every year or every other year. I found prices anywhere from almost $3/chick to $7/chick depending upon breed. If you buy large quantities, say a minimum of 50 chicks, you can get that price under $3 per chick in some places. The Cornish Cross chicks, commonly used for meat birds, used to be cheap. I’ve purchased them for $1/chick in the past. You’d have to purchase over 500 female chicks to get that price under $3/chick (from one hatchery I’ve used many times). These are incredibly high prices for chicks. If you are raising meat birds “organically”, the cost of the chick + the grower feed makes that table-ready chicken very expensive. Expect to spend a lot of money on chicken this year if you are used to “organic” chicken. Or learn to make one expensive whole chicken go a long way via casseroles or soups, using pastas, grains, and beans as fillers. I’m not here to debate bird flu testing (faulty PCR tests) or government policy, or even conspiracy theories, but I know this: If your homestead or farm chickens are healthy, you are good to go. Bird flu can wipe out entire flocks within 48 hours. If you wake up to dead birds, then you have a problem. You can take the slow route and quarantine sick birds, or you can take the fast route and cull all of them. There is a lot of “noise” in the dairy communities over bird flu. It is suggested that it can infect the cows. However, the cows can recover with treatment. Their milk can be discarded during that time. I don’t think there is a “dairy cow emergency”, although the idea is being hyped up in the media, and especially in regards to “the dangers of raw milk”. My milk cows are regularly tested for disease and have shown no signs of illness. Conversely, the cost of chicken feed has not gone up recently, and I suspect there may be an abundance of feed on the market, so it would be a good time to stock up, in my opinion. At least this is true in my area. If you are able to free-range chickens without predator pressure, feed costs go down dramatically. In any case, make your local chicken farmer your best friend. I did a “market study” of my area regarding the cost of eggs, chicks, and chicken meat. Prices are high here too even though I live in a rural area where a lot of people have backyard chickens. I’ve had horrible luck raising meat birds due to the predator issues, so I’ve been buying chicken meat from Costco. And I’m very picky about what I buy and usually go the organic route. I recently paid $7/lb for organic chicken. Ouch. I can get chicken fairly cheaply from the Amish, but they do not follow organic practices here. Locals who grow out organically raised chicken meat are charging at least $7.50/lb. Locally grown, non-organic chickens usually go for about $4/lb. “Non-organic” is to say they are not fed organic grains. Most people in the homesteading groups are raising meat birds in a cooperative fashion, exchanging butchering help for meat as payment. Great idea! I am considering participating in this approach. A few years ago I invested in chicken butchering equipment (plucker, scalder, knives, cones, etc.), none of which you actually need to butcher chickens but it speeds up the process. After several of my meat bird flocks were wiped out by the coyotes, I almost sold the equipment. But, instead, I solved the coyote problem with Livestock Guardian Dogs, and kept the equipment. Turns out that was a good decision. I bought a good incubator. I will be raising my own chicks to “refresh” my flock and I can sell the extras I’m sure. Now that I have my predator problem under control, I can hope to keep a good sized flock of chickens going for a long time. You don’t have to invest in an incubator if you’ve already got some good, broody, hens who will raise chicks for you. I have only had one broody hen in all these years and she only raised two chicks who were picked off by predators, so that doesn’t work well for me. Coyotes and Bobcats are not the only problem. Hawks and turkey vultures are also prevalent here. I do not “take advantage” of my farm customers when prices are high. I keep my prices stable because my farm customers appreciate it. If my feed costs went through the roof, I probably wouldn’t keep a large flock nor sell into my community because it would be financially draining. If I can continue to feed the chickens off the farm, my costs are low after the initial investments. My goal is to not need to buy grain from an outside source. I’m not sure that is fully possible, but we’ll see. The chickens are fed from the large gardens and with excess milk from the cows Spring, Summer, and Fall. They are fed non-GMO grains during winter, but grain is always available to them. They prefer to forage. I also am in process of enclosing the large chicken run that surrounds the large hen house. This will keep wild birds and smaller animals out of the chicken area. By enclosing, I mean framing, roofing, and hardware cloth walls, so that there is plentiful ventilation, vegetation, and sunlight. My chickens used to roam far and wide, but with predator issues that became problematic so they are all contained now. I’m hoping to create the healthiest environment possible for them without letting them free-range across the farm. The barn cats keep the mouse population down in and around the hen house, so if I enclose it that will keep the barn cats out. I haven’t quite figured out that dynamic yet. The barn cats are extremely helpful. The hen house is built up off the ground and the cats like to hide under the hen house. It may be that I need to keep a couple of barn cats in the chicken run fulltime, but not sure that works in the winter unless I create their own shelter inside the run for them. That is a possibility. I used to have a cat that preferred to live in the hen house. She never bothered the hens or eggs. She was just hunting for mice fulltime and napping the rest of the time. I do not know how long the “chicken emergency” will last. But, I think my plan that includes better tools for self-sufficiency will hold me in good stead. I guess you could call me an anti-vaxxer because I do not like to vaccinate my animals against disease. Instead, I prefer for them to be born and live in the most natural way possible without intervention. I prefer to provide them with what God intended them to have to the best of my ability in order to grow strong immune systems without the aid of man-made chemicals. However, that idealism comes with heavy responsibilities. We live in a fallen world full of death and disease, predators, and disasters. In the same way, you can’t just throw dairy cows out into a field, fending for themselves, and expect them to thrive without first determining whether or not their needs can be met by the natural environment. They need good grazing grass, fresh water sources, sunshine, shade, and the ability to stay out of the muck and severe weather. They need a good source of hay, minerals, and salt. For instance, Blackleg is an organism in the soil, endemic in some areas, that will kill a calf within 24 hours. Would I vaccinate against Blackleg if I needed to? You bet I would. Fortunately, I do not have that in my soil here. Achieving the balance of providing what is good for them, and protecting them is a balancing act. In the same way, the livestock guardian dogs receive veterinary care specifically for spay/neuter, tick prevention, and heartworm meds. The barn cats are looked over every day and are given the care they need as well. Even in my desire to care for all of my animals in the most natural way possible, I recognize that disease can kill my animals. This is the core of animal husbandry. Sometimes unnatural intervention is necessary to save their lives. (My animal vet is on speed dial). I choose to intervene when necessary rather than to over-medicate as a matter of course. That philosophy is also true for my human life. Moving forward, this is my plan to survive the “chicken emergency” that is currently in front of us. I may go to Costco and stock up on chicken for the freezer before prices go higher, or use the cooperative approach of raising meat birds with help from the community on butchering day.

(NYSE:TIXT), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), and ModivCare, Inc. (NASDAQ: MODV). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. TELUS International (Cda) Inc. (NYSE:TIXT) Class Period: February 16, 2023 - August 1, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 31, 2025 The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly failed to disclose to investors: (1) the Company’s AI Data Solutions offerings required the cannibalization of its higher-margin offerings; (2) that Telus International’s declining profitability was tied to the Company’s drive to develop AI capabilities; (3) that Telus International’s shift toward AI put greater pressure on the Company’s margins than previously disclosed; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

(NASDAQ:MU) Class Period: September 28, 2023 - December 18, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 10, 2025 The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) demand for Micron's products in consumer markets, especially the Company's NAND products, had significantly deteriorated; (ii) accordingly, Defendants had overstated the extent to which demand for Micron's products had recovered, particularly in consumer markets and for its NAND products, and/or had overstated the sustainability of demand for such products, as well as the normalization of inventory for such products; and (iii) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. For more information on the Micron class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MU ModivCare, Inc. (NASDAQ: MODV) Class Period: November 3, 2022 - September 15, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 31, 2025 The Class Action alleges that, during the Class Period, Defendants made misleading statements and omissions regarding the ability of its contracts to stabilize cash flow. As the alleged truth about ModivCare's business reached the market, the price of ModivCare's stock suffered significant declines, harming investors. For example, on September 16, 2024, before market hours, ModivCare filed a press release on a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, titled "ModivCare Provides Financial Update." Therein, the Company revised its 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance range from $185-$195 million to $170-$180 million, "primarily due to NEMT segment pricing accommodations made to strategically retain and expand key customer relationships." On this news, the Company's stock price fell $1.40 or nearly 10%, from $14.12 per share on September 15, 2024, to close at $12.72 per share on September 16, 2024, on unusually high trading volume.
