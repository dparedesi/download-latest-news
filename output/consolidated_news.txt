Title: Will more people sell BTC? Peter Schiff unpacks his ‘biggest Bitcoin mistake’

Bitcoin has seen high adoption, attracting over $1 trillion in inflows. Peter Schiff has admitted that he underestimated the extent people would FOMO in Bitcoin. According to the exec, his “biggest mistake” was downplaying people’s “foolishness” jumping on something that won’t work. Source: X The long-time BTC critic has been doomposting and predicting a BTC collapse for a while now. And yet, his overblown projections have never materialized. Back in 2018, for example, he warned that BTC would fall to $750, calling the $3800 price level at that time “overvalued.” BTC has since surged to over $120k before retreating to $90k, marking a nearly 23-fold increase. Even at its press time levels, Schiff still believes BTC will collapse and calls those who don’t see a zero-sum end-game “fools.” According to him, BTC is backed by “nothing” and is worth nothing – A belief he has held for over a decade. In fact, after BTC erased its 2025 gains, Schiff intensified attacks against the top BTC treasury Strategy, labelling it as “fraud.” Despite his position, however, BTC and overall crypto adoption have increased. In 2025, the APAC region led global crypto adoption, with India, Pakistan, and Vietnam being the dominant countries. As per Chainalysis, APAC saw a 69% YoY in received on-chain value from $1.4 trillion to $2.36 trillion. Chainalysis Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa followed closely as the second and third regions with the highest adoption rate. According to Chainalysis, the rising interest in the Global South has been driven by utilities such as remittances and everyday payments. At the asset level, BTC emerged as the most purchased cryptocurrency, followed by Ethereum. The report added, “Bitcoin leads by a wide margin, accounting for over $1.2 trillion in fiat inflows during the period. That’s slightly over 70% more than ETH, which saw roughly $724B in volume during this period.” Source: Chainalysis That being said, the U.S approval of Spot BTC ETFs in 2024 has been a bellwether for the maturing asset class. Overall, the products have attracted $58 billion in cumulative inflows since launch, led by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. In fact, BTC ETFs have become BlackRock’s top revenue source too. Now, JPMorgan and others want a piece of it in one way or another. For them, BTC acts as digital gold and a long-term safe haven against fiscal policy, a trend they call “debasement trade.” With institutional interest, global adoption, and a $1.8 trillion market cap, it’s hard to dismiss BTC as “nothing,” as Schiff tries to portray it.

Title: FedEx to close Texas logistics hub, cutting 856 jobs as âforever layoffâ trend grows

FedEx is closing a Coppell, Texas facility and permanently laying off 856 employees. The layoffs result from a major customer switching to a competitor's logistics provider. This follows other recent FedEx job cuts across North Texas facilities. The move reflects a national trend of constant small layoffs dubbed the "forever layoff." This pattern creates widespread worker anxiety and erodes traditional job security. The layoffs result from a major customer switching to a competitor's logistics provider.

The move reflects a national trend of constant small layoffs dubbed the "forever layoff." This pattern creates widespread worker anxiety and erodes traditional job security. This pattern creates widespread worker anxiety and erodes traditional job security. The American worker is under siege again, this time in the heart of Texas. In a move that exposes the fragile state of our economy and the disposable view corporations often hold of their workforce, FedEx is shuttering a Coppell logistics facility and laying off 856 employees. The cuts, set to begin in January with the facility closing by April 2026, follow the loss of a major customer to a competitor. This isn't an isolated incident but part of an unsettling pattern of endless job cuts eroding the foundation of the American middle class. FedEx, in its filing with the Texas Workforce Commission, coldly stated the reason: âThis action is necessitated solely by our customerâs decision to transition its business to a new location that will be managed by a new third-party logistics provider.â With that bureaucratic language, nearly 900 livelihoods are deemed expendable. The company noted the closure is âexpected to be permanent.â A pattern of cuts across North Texas The Coppell disaster is merely the latest blow from FedEx in the region. This past spring, the company announced 305 layoffs at a Fort Worth facility and another 131 at sites in Garland and Plano. These repeated reductions paint a picture of a contracting operation, not a growing enterprise supporting robust communities. FedEx representative Adam Snyder offered a standard corporate script, saying, âTeam members at this facility were notified in advance, and some will be eligible for other roles within the company, including at other FedEx facilities in the area.â The company pledges âjob placement assistance, relocation aid, or severance, as applicable.â But for many long-term employees, this is cold comfort. It represents a forced uprooting and the stressful scramble for new work in an increasingly hostile job market, all because a faceless client chose a different provider. The rise of the "forever layoff" This FedEx news is a single symptom of a national economic sickness. We are witnessing the normalization of what analysts grimly call the âforever layoff.â Companies have shifted from rare, large-scale restructuring to a constant drip of smaller cuts, creating a perpetual state of anxiety for workers. Job review service Glassdoor notes this trend is expected to âstoke worker anxiety as it continues in 2026.â The data is alarming. Layoffs of fewer than 50 people, which made up just 38% of cuts in 2015, now account for 51%. Andy Challenger of Challenger, Gray, & Christmas observed, âOver the last decade, companies have shied away from announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter, so itâs surprising to see so many in October.â The brutal timing of these announcements, often just before the holidays, shows an erosion of corporate conscience. The broader landscape is bleak. Major pillars of employment like Amazon, UPS, and Target have announced tens of thousands of job cuts recently. UPS alone has cut about 48,000 jobs this year. Nationally, we are on pace for a staggering 19.2 million layoffs annually, with 1.6 million workers handed pink slips each month. What does this say about the true state of the American economy? It speaks of a system where workers are the first and easiest cost to cut, where loyalty is a one-way street, and where the pursuit of efficiency and shareholder value trumps community stability and human dignity. The post-pandemic hiring boom has gone decisively bust, replaced by a cold, calculating corporate retrenchment. The FedEx layoffs in Coppell are a microcosm of this failure. A community will be impacted, local economies will feel the loss, and hundreds of families face an uncertain future. Itâs a harsh reminder that in todayâs economy, job security is an illusion for millions. As the "forever layoffs" continue to roll, one must question what kind of nation we are building when the engines of commerce so readily discard the very people who keep them running. The promise of stability that once defined American employment is being systematically broken, and the human cost is measured in thousands of notifications, just like the one filed in Texas.

Nationally, we are on pace for a staggering 19.2 million layoffs annually, with 1.6 million workers handed pink slips each month. What does this say about the true state of the American economy? It speaks of a system where workers are the first and easiest cost to cut, where loyalty is a one-way street, and where the pursuit of efficiency and shareholder value trumps community stability and human dignity. The post-pandemic hiring boom has gone decisively bust, replaced by a cold, calculating corporate retrenchment. The FedEx layoffs in Coppell are a microcosm of this failure. A community will be impacted, local economies will feel the loss, and hundreds of families face an uncertain future. Itâs a harsh reminder that in todayâs economy, job security is an illusion for millions. As the "forever layoffs" continue to roll, one must question what kind of nation we are building when the engines of commerce so readily discard the very people who keep them running. The promise of stability that once defined American employment is being systematically broken, and the human cost is measured in thousands of notifications, just like the one filed in Texas.

Title: Fed Chair Buzz Grows: Trump Says He Has Finalised Powell's Successor - Details Inside
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/economy-finance/fed-chair-buzz-grows-trump-says-he-has-finalised-powells-successor-details-inside
Time Published: 2025-12-01T02:35:04Z
Full Content:
US President Donald Trump on Sunday claimed that he will soon announce the next US Federal Fed Chair, having already selected a nominee who can succeed Jerome Powell. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One while returning to Washington, the US President confirmed his decision regarding the US Fed's leadership. “I know who I am going to pick, yeah. We’ll be announcing it,” Trump said. Trump's claim of 'soon replacing' Powell comes on the back of a prolonged grievance with the US Fed Chair and his cautious stance on the rate cut scenario. For a while, the US President has vouched for aggressive rate cuts to promote growth in the US economy. He has also blamed Powell for not cutting rates sooner. As per Bloomberg, White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is the likely frontrunner in the race to become the next US Fed. It appears Trump views Hassett as a favourable option as his views on aggressive rates align with those of Trump, although the appointment may raise questions about independence within the US Federal Reserve. “We had a great Treasury auction, interest rates went down and I think that the American people could expect President Trump to pick somebody who’s going to help them have cheaper car loans and easier access to mortgages at a lower rate,” Hassett said in a recent interview with CBS News. In yet another interview to Fox News, Hassett went a step further and admitted he would be happy to serve as the US Fed Chair if given the opportunity. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggests Trump may announce his final nominee before the Christmas holiday. There are other candidates also involved in the race, though, including Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, former governor Kevin Warsh and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder.

Title: BlackRock Exec Says Bitcoin ETFs Becoming A Major Revenue Source Was A ‘Big Surprise’

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) are one of the biggest narratives and have been a game-changer in the cryptocurrency space in the past two years. With these investment products, people get to participate in the cryptocurrency market without having to directly own the digital assets. Interestingly, one of the biggest winners—that often gets overlooked—has been the issuers, especially as the crypto industry has seen increased institutional adoption since the Bitcoin ETFs launched. According to the firm’s executive, the BTC exchange-traded funds becoming the major source of revenue for BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, was not envisioned. At the Blockchain Conference 2025 in São Paulo on Friday, November 28, BlackRock’s business development director in Brazil, Cristiano Castro, told reporters that the Bitcoin ETFs are the largest revenue source for their company. According to the executive, this development came as a “big surprise” to the asset management firm. Castro said in a statement: We were very optimistic when we launched, but we didn’t believe it would reach such proportions. Just to give you an idea, it [IBIT in the US and IBIT39 in Brazil – the asset’s reference names] came very close to US$100 billion [in allocation]. This feat is notable for the Bitcoin ETFs, especially considering that BlackRock offers more than 1,400 exchange-traded products globally and has a whopping $13.4 trillion in assets under management. The US-based Bitcoin fund (with the IBIT ticker) has over $70.7 billion in net assets, becoming the first ETF to reach the $70-billion mark (doing so in June 2025). While the US Bitcoin ETF market has somewhat slowed down, BlackRock’s IBIT still continues to outpace other ETFs launched in recent years. As earlier reports suggested, IBIT had managed to generate roughly $245 million in annual fees as of October 2025. When asked about the recent outflows from BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF as the market leader’s value fell, the director stated that there are zero surprises in that trend. “ETFs are very liquid and powerful instruments, and they serve precisely to allow people to allocate their capital and manage their cash flow,” Castro noted. The BlackRock director said that the withdrawals are expected, considering that the product is heavily owned by retail investors, who are reactionary in nature to price corrections. On Friday, the iShares Bitcoin Trust saw a net outflow of $113.72 million, bringing the weekly record to a negative $137.01 million and the fund to its fifth-consecutive week of withdrawals.

While the digital asset industry was not his first choice, he has remained absolutely drawn since making a foray into the space over two years.

Opeyemi is a proficient writer and enthusiast in the exciting and unique cryptocurrency realm. While the digital asset industry was not his first choice, he has remained absolutely drawn since making a foray into the space over two years. Now, Opeyemi takes pride in creating unique pieces unraveling the complexities of blockchain technology and sharing insights on the latest trends in the world of cryptocurrencies. Opeyemi savors his attraction to the crypto market, which explains why he spends the better parts of his day looking through different price charts. “Looking” is a rather simple way to describe analyzing and interpreting various price patterns and chart formations. However, it appears that is not Opeyemi’s favorite part - in fact, far from it. Being able to connect what happens on a price chart to on-chain movements and blockchain activities is what keeps Opeyemi ticking. “This emphasizes the intricacies of blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency market,” he would say. Most importantly, Opeyemi thinks of any market insights as the gospel, while recognizing that he is only a messenger. When he is not clicking away at his keyboard, Opeyemi is most definitely listening to music, playing games, reading a book, or scrolling through X. He likes to think he is not loyal to a particular genre of music, which can be true on many days. However, the fast-rising Afrobeats genre is a staple in Opeyemi’s Spotify Daily Mix. Meanwhile, Opeyemi is a voracious reader who enjoys a wide category of books - ranging from science fiction, fantasy, and historical, to even romance. He believes that authors like George R. R. Martin and J. K. Rowling are the greatest of all time when it comes to putting pen to paper. Opeyemi believes his reading of the Harry Potter series twice is proof of that. Indeed, Opeyemi enjoys spending most of his time within the four walls of his home. However, he also sometimes finds solace in the company of his friends at a bar, a restaurant, or even on a stroll. In essence, Opeyemi’s ambivert (haha! been searching for an opportunity to use the word to describe myself) nature makes him a social chameleon who is able to quickly adapt to different settings. Opeyemi recognizes the need to constantly develop oneself in order to stay afloat in a competitive and ever-evolving market like crypto. For this reason, he is always in learning mode, ready to pick up the slightest lesson from every situation. Opeyemi is efficient and likes to deliver all that is required of him in time - he believes that “whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well.” Hence, you will always find him striving to be better. Ultimately, Opeyemi is a good writer and an even better person who is trying to shed light on an exciting world phenomenon - cryptocurrency. He goes to bed every day with a smile of satisfaction on his face, knowing that he has done his bit of the holy assignment - spreading the crypto gospel to the rest of the world.

Title: Ballygunner the undisputed kings of Munster as they see off Éire Óg to claim sixth provincial crown

A few minutes before the final whistle the usual entreaty came over the public address, pleading with patrons to stay off the pitch at the end of the game. Even in the spilling rain, a couple of hundred Ballygunner supporters turned a deaf ear. Once more, Semple Stadium was their playground and their turf. Ballygunner’s place among the greatest club teams of all time rests on their capacity to add more All-Irelands to the one they already have. But they have now risen to the top of the Munster hurling roll of honour, their sixth title knocking Blackrock off a perch they had occupied since the end of the 1970s. They were smooth and laser-focused and in challenging conditions their hurling was outlandishly slick and coherent. In the second half, when the heavens opened, they hit nine points without surrendering a single wide and at one stage their lead had stretched out to double figures. Any reasonable doubt about the outcome perished before half-time. Their captain Peter Hogan is one of seven players to have made an appearance in every Munster final that Ballygunner have won since this glorious run started in 2018. A year ago, Ballygunner were raging-hot favourites too and, for one reason or another, they capsized. In the psyche of a team those defeats are like plastic, they never decompose. “You have to learn from your biggest defeats,” said Hogan. “We were hurting last year and thankfully we learned a lot of hard lessons. I think our work rate has gone up. I think we went into the Munster final a small bit undercooked last year. I think we were 1-4 to a point down last year after 10 minutes. We targeted the start of the game this year.” Ballygunner didn’t make an explosive start, but by the end of the first quarter they had begun to assert themselves and after 20 minutes they were 0-8 to 0-3 in front. Their build-up play and finishing were electric and Dessie Hutchinson was at the heart of it. He finished the game with seven points, five of them in the first half, as he shifted from the inside line to the half-forward line and switched wings as he saw fit, attacking with the dexterity of a drone. With Waterford, in the first half of the year, Hutchinson’s form had been so dull that he was eventually dropped in the championship but with Ballygunner he has recovered his mojo. Alongside him, young Patrick Fitzgerald has assumed a greater leadership role too and once again he was terrific. His point from under the New Stand, 10 minutes before half-time, was fit to grace any final. Éire Óg’s defence was running from one blaze to another with a knot in their hose. “They’re 10 years down the road in terms of their preparation,” said Gerry O’Connor, the Éire Óg manager. “We’ve two years done, some of our lads have a year done. And it was always the fear factor that with an inexperienced team like that that we were going to face a really difficult challenge. “Ultimately, it was just a step too far. Fifteen minutes into that game, the writing was on the wall really. They were exceptional. Their pace from the middle third and their running off the shoulder, we just weren’t able to get to grips with that.” Éire Óg had made an encouraging beginning and were 0-3 to 0-2 in front after eight minutes. One of their points was a delicious piece of improvisation from Darren Moroney, who whipped the ball over the bar after the ball dropped from his hand. But after Danny Russell scored his second point from a free, the Clare champions didn’t score again until Russell’s third free, 13 minutes later. During that scoring lag Ballygunner took over. Éire Óg were being slaughtered on their own puck outs when they went long and came under consistent pressure when they went short. Either way the ball they sent to their attack was originating from too deep. Time and again Éire Óg forwards were outnumbered and outhustled. Shane O’Donnell made a greater contribution as the game wore on but his Clare team-mate David Reidy couldn’t raise a gallop and was replaced in the closing minutes. Russell, who had been hugely influential in the semi-final, couldn’t reprise that performance. For Éire Óg to have any chance, those three players especially needed to catch fire. Ballygunner were 0-12 to 0-4 ahead at the break and absorbed Éire Og’s best spell midway through the second half when the Clare champions brought the deficit down to seven with three unanswered points. But that surge of momentum petered out and before Russell scored a goal from a penalty in the final minute of normal time they had not scored in the final quarter. The game was up. BALLYGUNNER: S O’Keeffe, A O’Neill, I Kenny, T Foley, H Ruddle, Philip Mahony, R Power, C Sheahan (0-1), P Leavey, D Hutchinson (0-7), Pauric Mahony (0-5, 4f), P Hogan (0-3), P Fitzgerald (0-4, 1f), K Mahony, M Mahony (0-1).

Title: November 2025 in Review

The Site The site itself ran on its merry way without much in the way of problems with WP.com. In fact, they even sent me some money. I hit the mark for a WordAds payout so they put money into my PayPal account, bringing my total since I began turning ads on back in 2021 to just shy of $900. I am not going to quit my day job, but that does cover the hosting for both this site, which is on the Premium plan, and my other site, which is on the Personal plan. As always, if you are reading this, I advise you to use an ad blocker. I don’t control the ad content and I want to tax comment bots and random passers by, not any returning guests. Still, that is enough ad revenue to make me consider the Business plan which, among other things, lets you use plugins. It is a limited set of plugins, and some of the better plugins also have a monthly or annual charge, but at least it would be an option. That might get me to blogroll version 10. Also, the business plan gives you a staging version of your site to check out changes before pushing them live. This tempts me as I have mentioned my current blog theme, 2012, has passed its expiration date and it likely to break at some point so I feel like the time is ripe to start trying on new templates. Finally, only semi-related, I was away all last week. It is hard to tell, I know. The quality of my content doesn’t change much whether I write that morning or out several days in advance. I suspect the former has more typos, but not many more. We were down in San Diego for the holiday week, where the weather was warm and pleasant along the beach. Crystal Pier stretching out into the calm Pacific It wasn’t hot, but it was warm enough, getting up into the mid-70s while we were down there. We were down there to escape both the 30+ year tradition of hosting Thanksgiving at our house and to check out the university down there where our daughter may go to grad school. We spent a day wandering the sprawling campus, but for me the highlight was the library. The Theodor Geisel Library, named for Dr. Seuss If there is one thing that makes me wistful for college it is a giant, sprawling university library. Much of this one is below the structure you see above, sunk below ground level. I could wander the stacks of obscure volumes for days, many of which will never move beyond print, not being deemed valuable enough to be gobbled up by the Bezos Kindle machine. I used to spend a lot of idle time at the library at my own alma mater discovering things like bound regimental histories, donated by members, detailing their journeys and assignments back in WWI, competing theories of acting methodologies, a dense tome detailing regional accents of the US getting down to county level variations with pronunciation keys, and budgets for local cities back into the 19th century. This was back when the internet was still getting used to the concept of electronic mail and more than a decade before even Yahoo was a thing. Anyway, that was a nice distraction. Now we’re back home and it is 15 degrees cooler and I can understand why people flock to the southern end of the state. One Year Ago The Stars Reach pre-alpha play tests took us into space for the first time. We then got some new worlds, and some of the fun of the time was bugs like falling through the world. We even got some weekday tests. The team also put out a new trailer and those of us in the pre-alpha were able to buy a special T-shirt. The Legacy of Morgoth expansion landed in Lord of the Rings Online. I reflected on 20 years of EverQuest II. That was much lower key than my EverQuest 25th anniversary posts. There was also the launch of the Scars of Destruction expansion, the 21st for the game. Blizzard put out a roadmap for WoW Classic. That included the quickly launched 20th Anniversary classic servers, a replay of 2019 with some slight changes. A whole legion of players seemed unable to understand that saying The Burning Crusade would be coming to these servers in Winter/Spring 2026 meant it wouldn’t be arriving until Winter/Spring of 2026. Really, some peak “I didn’t read the assignment” levels of reaction. Anyway, I poked my nose in… and it wasn’t crazy like 2019 and original WoW Classic. There was also a roadmap for retail WoW, which included housing… only 20 years late according to some. It was still a year away, but the very idea made a lot of people pin their hopes and dreams on the idea. I also reflected a bit on the 20 years of World of Warcraft on its anniversary. Meanwhile, our time in Cataclysm Classic , where 2019 classic currently sat, was waning as we attempted the Heroic Deadmines. It did not go well. Azeroth nostalgia having been sated, I decided to try out Enshrouded. I quickly reported back to the group and soon had a server up for all of us. We dove right in and started to learn about all the things to do in the game, including how to tame a feral cat. That seemed to be the end of Cataclysm Classic for us. In EVE Online I was reflecting on a rather modest Crimson Harvest event. The October MER certainly indicated that somebody made a lot of ISK off of the event. Then the Revenant expansion arrived. New ships, new SKINNR stuff, new attempts to “fix” null sec from people who never played in null sec. But, hey, free Omega time and login rewards! Out in null sec we were in our fourth week of the great move op to Tenerifis. We were more committed to the bit than you can imagine. The Initiative announced that they would be resetting all standings and going it alone come January 1. I wrote about EVE Galaxy Conquest and how it was not the 4X game you might have been hoping for. I may have referred to it as Clash of Clones. I also deleted it from my iPad shortly thereafter. In my telephone tales series, I was on about how bad Intervoice was as a company and then went on to West Corporation… also a bad company, but a different… or maybe indifferent… sort of bad. I mean, at least they had a plan. I had a Friday bullet points post about financials from Enad Global 7 and Pearl Abyss. Blue Sky seemed to be doing well in the social media wars. It was certainly a better place that whatever Twitter had become and whatever Threads was pretending to be. At least it wasn’t run by immoral billionaires to further the cause of immoral billionaires. Finally, I was wondering how elves in general, and Elrond in particular, could even handle the passage of time as immortals. Five Years Ago EverQuest II celebrated its sweet sixteen with some unexpected downtime. Oops. EverQuest was getting ready for the Claws of Veeshan expansion. World of Warcraft was spinning up for the Shadowlands expansion, and I was getting in a few tasks before it landed. There was also the beta and something about multiboxing software and the fact that BlizzCon Online being free. I was also wondering if anybody really needed a level booster after the big level squish. The ride to 50 was pretty fast. We were still playing around a bit in the level squished Northrend, trying to do a three person with Prince Keleseth. That did not end well. I also started a demon hunter to try the run to 50 in the level squish. It was a quick run, though it got strange because I wasn’t in quite the right timeline. Then there were the pre-events in Northrend… and I always love going to Northrend. There was plenty to do up there. And then there was the pre-launch calm before we were finally let into Shadowlands. It seemed like a pretty smooth launch once you got past the crowd in Stormwind. The zones were quick and fun and I was soon making my debut in the theater of pain. and then off into Ardenweald. Meanwhile, in WoW Classic, we were working out way to the detention block in Blackrock Depths and then Shadowforge City after which we went walking with Marshal Windsor. On the WoW Classic front Blizz was talking about plans and bans. I hit level 40 in Pokemon Go. I was also using Discord to get overseas raid invites to catch special legendaries. There were some more shows to write about in the great pandemic binge watch. And of course there was EVE Online and World War Bee, which I will just sum up in a list of posts: And so it went. Ten Years Ago The launch of Fallout 4 caused a dip in porn viewing on the internet. Nintendo announced they were re-releasing Pokemon Red, Blue, & Yellow on the 3DS Virtual Console. BlizzCon was approaching and I laid out a “need vs greed” list of things I thought would happen at the event. But before BlizzCon there had to be the Q3 quarterly results. The big news was that World of Warcraft held steady and had 5.5 million subscribers. However, Blizzard said they were not going to talk about subscription numbers any more. They would be talking about Candy Crush Saga though, having purchased King for 5.9 billion dollars. Then BlizzCon came and I had to score my list. It also slipped out a bit early that the WoW Legion expansion would not hit until summer 2016, September 21 being the last possible date listed, which seemed a long ways off. I wasn’t yet ready to return to the game. I used gold to grab a WoW Token for 30 days of play time and spend the most of it just earning that money back running missions in my garrison. StarCraft II: Legacy of the Voice, the final part of the trilogy launched. I dipped my toe back in Lord of the Rings Online for a bit. Still playing Minecraft, I finished up the Great Northern Road and highlighted the guardian farm that Aaron built. In New Eden, the Parallax expansion was released, the last named monthly update in Syndicate to be released. From then on names were reserved for big expansions while monthly updates were simply know by their date… or New Eden date… or build number. CCP can’t even hold the line on that naming scheme. There was also the start of the ill-fated Fountain War Kickstarter campaign, which was plagued by hubris, gaffes, bad ideas, and “Grrr Goons” hostility. Not that it didn’t deserve some of the latter as it was a clusterfuck and was not winning fast enough. It was finally cancelled before the clock ran down, but it left a bad taste in everybody’s mouth. There was also a Fountain War video which was better received… but then nobody was asking for $150,000 to produce it. Meanwhile, another member of CSM X got cut. Not a Goon. CCP Quant took his EVE Vegas presentation and made it the first of the monthly EVE Economic reports to be publish. And actually in the game, the Reavers were down in Wicked Creek to spar with TEST. We were not there long, but it was one of those deployments that generated its own legends in the SIG. We were called back because a small war was brewing in Cloud Ring against some foes, old and new. Some had no sov and were hitting us from low sec. We fell on them when we could in what was being dubbed the “Kickstarter War.” Herein lay some of the seeds of what would become the “Casino War.” Over at Daybreak, EverQuest II got the Terrors of Thalumbra of expansion while EverQuest got expansion number 22, The Broken Mirror. There was the Phinigel “true box” progression server coming up for EverQuest. The EverQuest II server consolidation was wrapping up, on Stormhold the Kingdom of Sky expansion was voted down, and the game turned 11, all of which I covered in a single post. Daybreak also shut down Dragon’s Prophet, which lived on in Europe under another publisher. Smed, gone from Daybreak, wanted to stop talking about money when it came to video games. And finally, I had a test… a Star Wars test… for those wishing to date my daughter. Fifteen Years Ago I was talking about group size and roles. That has come up again, especially since SWTOR groups seemed to be limited to four players. On the retro front, I played some Total Annihilation. Still one of the best RTS games ever. I took a look at the soon to be defunct EverQuest II Extended. It seemed quite busy. Of course, I went Station Access so I could peek into EverQuest II (with some issues) and EverQuest as well. The rump instance group was wrapping up another Summer in Middle-earth at the far end of the Lone Lands as well as in and around Ost Guruth. At the same time, Turbine was putting crafting materials in the LOTRO Store. Meanwhile, the OTHER LOTRO store, the real life one, wasn’t doing much for me. CCP announced that they were removing learning skills from EVE Online. I hit 60 million skill points and was going to get to reallocate some of them as part of the skill point refund. The Cataclysm open beta was coming to an end at last. I think part of the problem with the expansion was how long people were freely talking about the expansion… and playing it… before it came out. We all knew what the hot new hunter pet would be and how much the world was going to be changed. Cheap copies of WoW were not going to fix that. Back in pre-Cataclysm Azeroth, I was summing up my Wintergrasp experiences and moaning about missing the damn Hallow’s End mask quest achievement again. On the Pokemon front, I finished the National Pokedex in Pokemon SoulSilver. In your face! And the march to the release of Pokemon Black and White was commencing. The Microsoft Kinect for XBox launched. The news seemed to be confused as to whether or not flying cars had come at last. And, finally, in the completion of a boyhood dream of mine, the San Francisco Giants won the World Series, officially releasing me from caring about major league ball ever again. Twenty Years Ago Guitar Hero launches for the PlayStation 2 and kicks off a series of games (and a competitor) for people who can play air guitar. The New Game Experience, or NGE, hit Star Wars Galaxies, completely changing the character development path. Landing just days after the Trials of Obi-wan expansion launched, players were so enraged that SOE ended up offering refunds to players who bought the expansion. The NGE became a weight around SOE’s neck and studio head John Smedley ends up being asked (and harassed) about the whole thing for many years. Forty Years Ago Origin Systems releases Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar, the last of the Ultima series I ended up playing. I had an Apple II at the time, but by the time Ultima V came along I had a Mac and the Ultima series never went there. Also, I liked Ultima III better… or enjoyed it more.

Given that I was away for the last week of the month, EVE Online is probably under represented… and doubly so when you consider how much time I spend tabbed out while playing. No Man’s Sky was running two expeditions… which didn’t leave much time for Palia or checking out much more than a bit of the new water stuff in Enshrouded. Meanwhile, Palworld managed to get pushed off the list completely. We might be looking for a replacement. Enshrouded We got water in the game, along with more levels, a new zone, and fishing. In another month I might have spent a lot more time exploring all of this. November though… it was more about spaceships really. EVE Online So much time in the Drone regions, so many structures to shoot, and so many trips around the region. That got me on three more Keepstar kills and a host of other smaller structures. It has also opened up a great land rush into the Drone regions that will be an unfolding drama for a while. Then there is the question of what becomes of Pandemic Horde. They remain the fourth largest sov holding alliance in the game, and fifth largest if we expand to all alliances (which may soon be relevant as they may soon not hold any sovereignty) even after shedding nearly 60% of their members. What will become of them? No Man’s Sky It was the kick off of holiday expedition time. That has its ups and downs. On the one hand, I do like being able to go back and run expeditions that I have missed. On the other hand, doing several expeditions in close succession does tend to emphasize the sameness of some of the expeditions and tasks they require. They do have a pattern. Palia I spent two weeks playing just NMS and EVE and now my chickens are all depressed. And, as noted earlier this week, I can’t figure out what to buy in the cash shop. But for a cozy MMO it has managed to carry on for me. Pokemon Go This got over represented in play time if only because it was the only title I played for a week while we were down in San Diego. My wife and I tend to play even more when on vacation. Meanwhile, we have been focusing somewhat on the tasks to get us to level 72. It looks like the stardust task will be the final one for both of us. Coming Up Oh, it is time for all of the end of the year nonsense, isn’t it? So many recaps that I will probably need a meta recap post to sum up all the summing up or something. Also, the holiday season, something reflected in many titles. For EVE Online it will mean the Winter Nexus event. It promises to be an otherwise quiet month, at least in our portion of null sec. The Drone regions will still be in flux. In No Man’s Sky we have three more expeditions on the agenda, though I did two of them earlier this year, so may tap out after the next one. Everybody else will have seasonal events, and there will even be the housing launch in retail WoW, though I will be sitting that one out, my account having lapsed. Then, of course, there is the Steam Winter Sale, the Steam Awards (nominations open now) and all which that entails. And we’ll be down to the wire on Fantasy Critic League. But mostly it will be wrapping up 2025 and getting ready to cast a weather eye on what is approaching in 2026. Whenever I went to the library at my school, I’d almost instantly fall asleep, and I wasn’t alone. There’d be so many students crashed out with their faces pressed against whatever book they were studying… LOL They ran some kind of white noise system to keep it quiet and it was SO peaceful compared to the dorms!

Title: As Energy Needs Grow, So Do New Home Energy Programs
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennifercastenson/2025/11/30/as-energy-needs-grow-so-do-new-home-energy-programs/

ByJennifer Castenson, Contributor. For three years running, the price of electricity has increased at a faster pace than inflation, pushing the home energy costs higher at a time that most Americans cannot afford the additional costs. NEADA, a group that represents state directors of energy aid programs for low-income families, reports that Americans are paying 11% more for electricity than they were in January. That number varies across the country. For instance, in Missouri, costs have gone up 37%, while in some states they have gone down by as much as 13%. Fortunately, solutions are coming online that not only help stabilize the country’s aging grid, but that can also lower prices for consumers. While consumers are feeling the mounting cost pressures for home energy, they also are demanding more from mobile devices, and from AI-powered innovations that require a large energy pull from data centers. All of the increased demand is causing competition for energy, so homeowners are exacerbating the affordability issue. “We are facing two crises in America today—the first is in reliability and the second is in affordability,” said Mark Christie, former U.S. Chairman Federal Energy Regulatory Commission at a recent event hosted by energy technology company Schneider Electric. “From a reliability standpoint, the crisis we face comes down to supply and demand for power. Demand is growing and has been growing much faster than the new generating resources that we are bringing online. That leaves a gap that means reliability issues.” When ChatGPT launched in 2023, investment in building data centers was $15 billion and now it is above $41 billion according to homebuilder association NAHB’s analysis. Utilities are starting to understand that homes can be a resource, yet recognizing that there is a significant amount of complexity to manage all of the energy draw in the home. Marta Asack is the senior vice president of power products in North America for Schneider Electric and recognizes the importance of new energy sources. The energy transmits first from the grid’s connection to the home, then the meter is the entry point to the home, next the panel is the distribution system in the home, and the breakers manage the load for each item in the home. All of that is orchestrated through a home energy management system, which today is only a single information flow, but in the future can be bi-directional. “As we get more smart home technology and want to orchestrate the grid with the home, we need to add a software layer that can make choices to prioritize energy use,” Asack said. “From a cost perspective, we need to first make products very efficient, then we need to work with different providers to have the systems be interoperable.” This is where the work of her colleagues comes into play. “The utility industry now sees the opportunity to operate the home and the elements in the home in the same way we operate a microgrid,” said Scott Harden, the senior vice president and CTO at Schneider Electric, who oversees the company’s connected home platforms. “They are seeing that grid-interactive homes can help solve the AI and data center power crunch, and how they can achieve more resilient housing.” As homes become more intelligent, it opens the opportunity to also be grid interactive. Next year, Schneider Electric will be capturing that opportunity by launching a digital backbone that connects home technologies, such as appliances, batteries and converters, to the grid. The software would provide better visibility on energy use, monitoring the loads in the home as a system of systems to then be coordinated for better energy use. “We believe we are at an interesting inflection point in home energy technology," Harden added. "There are now a high degree of systems in the home that are not only energy related, but connected and intelligent and in many cases interactive. These systems would benefit from some level of orchestration.” To create an efficient interactive home in its diverse ecosystem, standards and protocols are critical. There are three that dictate this environment. Matter is for device to device in the home, OCPP connects chargers and Modbus talks inverters. “Five years ago this wasn’t a thing, now most are starting to adopt the same protocols,” Harden said. IEEE 2030.5 is a communication standard to manage distributed energy resources in a smart grid, not a microgrid itself, but it is critical for microgrid-like functionality where energy resources like solar panels, batteries, and EVs work together. It provides a standardized, secure, and interoperable way for the devices to communicate with each other and with the grid to facilitate smart charging, demand response, and grid support. Bridging technology is connecting that community level to the three home protocols, so the standardization is important. Harden envisions more benefits for homeowners, such as subsidies from the utilities to participate in the programs along with programs for revenue generation. Schneider Electric’s digital backbone will be able to monitor energy use in the home, providing access to usage data that can then inform the system with the ways to optimize performance. The vendor agnostic platform will be a goldmine of data that will be available to the homeowner and to others that are building products and services around the segment. The learning will inform future direction and strategy as well, including the performance and reliability of renewables as they become available. James Lee, partner at Blackrock Global Infrastructure Partners says that energy demands from data centers will push us into nuclear and geothermal. “Small nuclear reactors are growing fast,” he said. “Storage and batteries and cleantech didn’t get killed in the One Big Beautiful Bill.” Asack also talks about the importance of investing in skilled labor to support a more electrified world. “We need more efficient systems along with more electricians," she said. "We need to train them and get them to scale up. As we move into more AI and more connected systems and move away from more mechanical solutions, we have to upscale, and now it’s about software-based systems.” The electricians have to work at multiple levels and will now need to understand increasingly sophisticated protocols, technology and where it’s all headed. In the future, Asack believes there will be advanced partnerships with data enters, buildings, offices, homes, and across different industries sand segments. In the Energy & Environmental Building Alliance session, Transforming our communities into grid assets, Matt Brost, vice president of new home sales at​ Sunrun​ discussed the ways to design communities that can store and share energy with rooftop solar, batteries and flexible load management to help stabilize local power systems. His company is developing solar and storage as a service by enrolling communities into virtual power plant programs and already has more than ​​106,000​ ​​customers with an ​​output of ​​416,​​​​200​​ megawatts​ in the past year​, comparable to a medium-sized gas power plant. Through this program, homeowners have lower utility costs, better resilience, and reliable power during outages. He shares that entire communities could be retrofitted, depending on the integrity of the existing utility infrastructure. His focus on new construction is delivering cost benefits from coupling solar and storage in the form of a power purchase agreement that is priced less than what the utility would charge, and by providing an additional revenue stream to the customer for participating in a virtual power plant. “What’s even better is that these customers also end up with resilient homes that provide power to essential loads during outages,” he added. “It’s a trifecta for the homeowner--lower energy costs, locked in rates, and the ability to keep the lights on in an outage.” Sunrun is seeing more demand for virtual power plants as demand continues to increase on the country’s aging grid. Harden did quick math on the homeowner upgrades that provide this grid reciprocity, which adds up to about $30,000 with solar, storage, EV charging, along with a smart thermostat. Utilities may offer some sort of rebate because it will give them access to the infrastructure provided by the homeowner. The future holds a lot of possibility, but will take careful preparation and collaboration. With the future promise of a software-based program, it would not be bound by geography. “The control point is software so homes can be connected digitally and managing end points that can be distributed,” Harden said. “Think of the home as the end point, preferences on the systems can be part of a capacity agreement with the homeowner such that they can pull five KwH at any time and could pull it from a temperature adjustment or taking from the battery and the end point in the home could help orchestrate that.” This all means growing complexity because aggregating 500 batteries across a territory, would mean running multiple programs across all those homes. It’s easy to see the possibilities and the opportunities, but also the multi-layered complexity. But there is promise for a big pay off where home energy becomes more affordable.

Cyber Monday 2025 Absolute Best Deals Deals Under $100 Laptop Deals Kindle Deals Apple Deals Tech Deals Headphone Deals Sleep Deals Phone Deals Coffee Deals Smart Birdfeeder Deals If you're a Costco member, you're no stranger to a nice discount, it's one of the things that makes that $65 per year worth the cost. Even so, Costco tends to go all out for Cyber Monday, luring members into the warehouse with the sweet smell of discounts on game consoles, kitchen gadgets, and computers, not to mention $1.50 hot dogs. I've scoured the ads and circled some of the WIRED gear team's favorite stuff for you, leading you straight to savings that would make even the biggest Kirkland doubter jealous. The discounts below are available now, though availability between online delivery and in-warehouse sales may be a little different depending on your location. For more great discounts, check out our Best Cyber Monday Deals roundup and all of our deals coverage here. KitchenAid KitchenAid Amazon Shop at Crate & Barrel You're likely to find a Kitchen-Aid Stand Mixer on the counter of almost any serious home chef, and for good reason. The renowned reliability and consistency has earned it a spot on our list of products you can buy for life, and mine has earned a permanent spot on on my counter, despite limited space. You can pick up the mixer, a 6-quart bowl, four attachments, and a pouring shield, for just $320, a $100 break off of Costco's usual price. Costco frequently discounts the heftier bowl-lift version, which I find useful for squeezing under my low cabinets, but this Cyber Monday deal is particularly juicy. There are three colors available, and while mine at home is the classic silver, if I had to do it again I'd go with the matte black. Ninja Amazon Crate & Barrel WIRED writer Matthew Korfhage is a big fan of the Ninja Slushi, a delightful drink maker for stirring up smoothies and margaritas at home. Just a few days ago, he spotted it on sale for $270, and it's not a competition, but Costco members can save an additional $20 on a special 96-oz version that includes two insulated cups with bubble tops. This compact machine makes drinks, keeps them frozen for 12 hours, and has easy machine-washable parts so nothing gets too sticky in between parties. Dyson Best Buy Amazon (V15 Detect) Amazon (V15 Detect Plus) Dyson The excellent Dyson V15 Detect is one of our favorite stick vacuums, and it's deeply discounted to just $500 at Costco, beating both Amazon and Best Buy by $50 while still including a suite of 10 accessories. The Detect naming comes from this vacuum's special trick, which analyzes the dust in front of it and adjusts your power to suit the mess. Is that a bit over-engineered for a stick vacuum? Maybe. But the results are hard to argue with, and it's one of our favorite Dyson vacuums for good reason. Apple Amazon (15-inch) Best Buy (13-inch) Apple Amazon (13-inch) If you're feeling more portable, you can also snag an Apple MacBook Air from Costco for just $750. It features similar specs to the Mac Mini above, with a 10-core M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. Reviewer Brenda Stolyar really liked this version of the machine, which pairs snappy performance with a smart screen and great battery life, and it's really only held back by limited ports and some heat management issues. Unlike the other sales, this one is only available until it sells out. Apple Amazon Best Buy Apple The compact Mac Mini from 2024 may be slightly dated, but it's still an excellent buy, especially with the Cyber Monday discount Costco has running, which brings the price down to just $480. It's fairly well equipped for its generation, with 16GB of memory, 256GB of SSD storage, and the 10-core Apple M4 processor, making it one of the least expensive devices with support for Apple Intelligence features. Sony Best Buy Walmart Amazon If you've been looking to upgrade your gaming setup ahead of those cold winter months, Costco has the Sony PlayStation 5 and an extra DualSense wireless controller for just $480. Considering the controllers run anywhere from $50-75 on their own, you're getting a noticeable discount on the console on top of being able to play with a friend. Bose Amazon B&H Bose They may be fresh on the market, but that won't stop Costco from knocking $50 off the Bose QuietComfort Ultra 2. WIRED writer Ryan Waniata recently got to spend some time with the sequel to one of our favorite noise-canceling headphones, and despite only minor upgrades, they still manage to improve the formula with new convenience features and the same great comfort and sound. Sonos Amazon Walmart The Sonos Arc Ultra is our favorite sound bar for standalone Dolby Atmos support, and Costco has it marked down to $880, just a dollar higher than Amazon's current price. Our reviewer Ryan Waniata was extremely impressed with the expansive soundstage, profound bass, and excellent clarity. It's also helped along by the updated mobile app, which has improved drastically over the last few iterations, and is particularly smart if you're already in the Sonos ecosystem.

Title: AIL Division 1A round-up: Clontarf hold off Terenure revival to secure nervy win

Clontarf moved above Terenure into second place in Division 1A with an entertaining, hard-earned and ultimately nervy 29-24 win in the ‘Jordan Coghlan Derby’ at Castle Avenue on Saturday. Due to the recent rain, this repeat of the 2022 and 2023 finals was moved to the all-weather pitch and was a better spectacle as a result. Dylan Donnelan opened the scoring from a trademark ‘Tarf power play and after an impudent grubber and finish by Chris Cosgrave, James Ryan’s brother, Mark, restored the lead on his debut. After a well-taken try by Terenure’s Connacht centre John Devine, Tarf halfbacks Sam Owens and Conor Kelly put Alex O’Grady over in the corner, Kelly adding a penalty for a 22-12 interval lead. Two big scrums led to Donnellan finished superbly for his seventh try this season and 83rd in less than four and a half campaigns. But Terenure, helped by the interval arrival of outhalf Caspar Gabriel – one of four Leinster travelling reserves released to their clubs – responded with tries by Harrison Brewer and winger Pa Ryan. And after Kelly’s penalty hit the upright, ‘Tarf had to snuff out one final sustained attack by ‘Nure. “It was a good contest, two good sides going at it,” said Clontarf’s coach Andy Wood. “I’m happy out to be honest. Any time you play Terenure and come away with a win it’s a good result. They play with a lot of ambition and it’s great to watch.” Terenure earned two bonus points and coach Carlos Spencer said: “We let in a couple of soft tries in the first half but we were still in the fight. Our set-piece was poor and our discipline probably cost us in the second half. We still gave ourselves an opportunity at the end but we couldn’t execute.” Lansdowne are a point further back in fourth after opening up a five-point gap on Ballynahinch with an 18-10 win at home. First-half tries by number eight Hardus van Eeden and scrumhalf Jack Matthews, to one by Aaron Sexton, had them 12-7 ahead at the break and two penalties by James Tarrant in a tryless second half sealed the win. Young Munster roared into a 26-17 lead 55 minutes into a fluctuating Munster derby at home to Cork Con after tries by Bailey Faloon and a third of the game by winger Hubert Gilvarry. But Con capitalised upon the binning of David Begley with tries by Aidan Moynihan and in-form centre Eoghan Smyth, before two late turnovers by Jack Kelleher completed an entertaining 29-26 win which arrested a run of three defeats. St Mary’s remained top with a 49-15 win at home to Nenagh, winger Aaron O’Sullivan and Myles Carey each scoring twice and Mick O’Gara converting all seven tries, while Old Belvedere climbed two places to seventh with a 36-12 win at home to UCD. Old Wesley stayed top in Division 1B with a 21-17 win at Highfield, while MU Barnhall and Galwegians maintained their unbeaten records atop 2A and 2B with 41-20 and 41-24 home wins over Ballymena and Enniscorthy respectively. Connacht winger Finn Treacy, playing at outside centre, scored three of ‘Wegians six tries, and inside centre Rob Deacy scored two.

RTÉ Sport contributor Ballygunner (Waterford) 0-21 Éire Óg Inis (Clare) 1-09 Ballygunner went clear atop the Munster hurling roll of honour after a damp-squib nine-point victory over Éire Óg Inis in front of 3,065 fans at Semple Stadium. The Waterford kingpins' sixth title pushes them one clear of Blackrock, while providing a fifth medal in seven seasons for many of their players. Dessie Hutchinson put in a man-of-the-match performance with 0-07 from play as the Gunners cruised to an All-Ireland semi-final against either Ballyhale Shamrocks or St Martin’s. Éire Óg got off to a decent start to lead 0-03 to 0-02 after eight minutes. Danny Russell picked off a couple of frees either side of Darren Moroney’s drop-shot point. That would prove their only score from play of the half. Darragh Stack saved from Kevin Mahony to maintain that lead a few moments longer. But it would be overwhelmed as the Gunners reeled off 10 of the final 11 points in the run-in to half-time. Philip Mahony mopped up everything Éire Óg hit long, and when the Clare champions tried to run the ball out, they got turned over. Hutchinson quickly emerged as the dominant figure as he floated in and out of the right corner-forward berth. His first point arrived in the fifth minute. His next pair, created by Michael Mahony, sparked a six-point surge, which included another from the stutter-stepping Déise captain. Patrick Fitzgerald scored a brilliant pair to complete the set. His dummy shot left Aaron Fitzgerald for dust for the first before nailing an outrageous second from the New Stand sideline. After a Russell free, the Gunners tagged on four more through Pauric Mahony (free), Peter Hogan, Conor Sheahan, and Hutchinson. They led 0-12 to 0-04 at half-time. That gap grew to 10 with points from Patrick Fitzgerald and a Pauric Mahony free. Éire Óg offered one last kick with three points in a row. Oran Cahill landed the first before Shane O’Donnell won back-to-back frees for Russell. They wouldn’t add another point beyond the 43rd minute as the Gunners reeled off four in a row, including a pair from the pacy Hutchinson. Éire Óg went goal hunting and they eventually found one on the hour. O’Donnell was pulled back by Ian Kenny for a penalty, which Russell dispatched. The 2024 Hurler of the Year O'Donnell led their resistance, being fouled for 1-04 plus two more frees which were dropped in. Russell ended with 1-06 all from placed balls.

Title: PagerDuty Falls to ~$1B Market Cap on $500M ARR. Just 2x ARR. Profitable Isn’t Enough. You Have to Grow.

by Jason Lemkin | 5 Interesting Things, Blog Posts, Scale PagerDuty just reported earnings, and the numbers tell a sobering story. The Captain Obvious lesson and reminder: Growth Remains King. Even if you are profitable. You just have to grow. And for now at least — PagerDuty just isn’t growing anymore. Here’s where they are today: And yet the stock is down 75%+ from its 2021 highs. Down nearly 50% from its IPO price of $38.25 back in 2019. Profitable isn’t enough. You have to grow. PagerDuty has built something real. Almost $500M in ARR. Over 15,000 paying customers. One-third of the Fortune 500. Customers like Cisco, Zoom, Fox, Shopify, and the NYSE. A 28.5% non-GAAP operating margin. Nearly $550M in cash on the balance sheet. 83%+ gross margins. This is a real business. A profitable business. A business that serves mission-critical use cases — when systems go down at 2am, PagerDuty is the one waking up the right engineer. And the market values it at 2x ARR. Meanwhile, companies still growing 30%+ trade at 10-15x ARR or more or higher. That’s a 5-7x difference in multiple. The lesson: A dollar of ARR growing 30%+ is worth 5-7x more than a dollar of ARR growing 4%. PagerDuty was once a rocketship. At IPO in 2019, they had 139% NRR — truly elite expansion. In 2022, it was still 124-126%. Customers were landing and expanding aggressively. Today? 100% NRR. That single metric tells the whole story. At 100% NRR: Here’s what the metrics trajectory looks like: When your NRR drops from 130%+ to 100%, your growth engine fundamentally breaks. You go from a flywheel to a treadmill. PagerDuty has had roughly 15,000-16,000 paid customers for three years. Essentially flat. Yes, they’ve grown the number of $100K+ customers from 825 to 867. That’s good! But it’s only 5% growth. And the overall customer base isn’t expanding. When your customer count goes flat, it means one of two things: Either way, it signals that finding new customers has gotten very, very hard. Here’s what founders sometimes miss: Profitability is necessary but not sufficient. PagerDuty made all the “right” moves for the 2022-2024 efficiency era: The market shrugged. Why? Because investors aren’t just buying today’s profits — they’re buying future cash flows. And if your ARR is only growing 4%, your future cash flows are capped. The valuation math: The premium multiples go to companies that can compound. 20%+ growth with strong unit economics gets 8-12x ARR. 30%+ gets you 12-18x. 40%+ and you’re looking at 20x+. PagerDuty’s 4% growth puts them in a different category entirely. In July 2025, Reuters reported that PagerDuty is exploring a sale with Qatalyst Partners. This is actually the second time they’ve explored selling — a similar effort in late 2023 didn’t produce an acceptable offer. This tells you everything about where the board’s head is at: The good news? At 2-3x ARR, PagerDuty is actually cheap for what it is. A strategic buyer who could cut costs further, or bundle it with other products, might pay 3-4x+ ARR. That’s a 30-50% premium from here. But for a company that once traded at 15-20x ARR? That’s a painful outcome for long-term shareholders. Here’s what makes PagerDuty’s situation even harder: the competitive landscape has fundamentally shifted against them. Attack from Above: The Platform Giants Are Bundling The biggest threat isn’t another startup — it’s the observability platforms bundling incident management into their offerings. In June 2024, Datadog launched Datadog On-Call, bringing paging and incident management directly into their observability platform. Their pitch is devastating for PagerDuty: why switch between tools when you can have monitoring AND on-call in one platform with shared context? As one analyst noted, Datadog’s On-Call “could directly challenge PagerDuty and Atlassian Opsgenie” by reducing context switching for IT ops teams. ServiceNow is another threat — they generate more than 20x PagerDuty’s revenue and are expected to grow at 21% CAGR. For large enterprises already in the ServiceNow ecosystem for ITSM, adding incident management is a checkbox, not a new vendor decision. Cisco acquired Splunk. Atlassian has OpsGenie. The platform consolidation trend is real, and standalone point solutions like PagerDuty are caught in the squeeze. Attack from Below: Hungry Startups Eating Their Lunch Meanwhile, a new wave of Slack-native incident management startups has emerged: These startups are purpose-built for modern engineering teams. They’re Slack-native (where engineers actually live), more affordable, and laser-focused on the incident response workflow. As one industry survey noted, “PagerDuty and OpsGenie remain the most-used solutions, but young startups like incident.io, Rootly, and FireHydrant are challenging them.” The startups explicitly position against PagerDuty’s complexity and cost. Rootly’s marketing literally says “Migrate from PagerDuty faster than you can write fair pricing.” The Market Has Changed When PagerDuty went public in 2019, they were the clear category leader with 139% NRR. The “incident management” category was theirs. But the market fragmented: PagerDuty tried to expand into AIOps, automation, and business operations to grow the TAM. But as one analyst observed, they “operate in a crowded market filled with bigger competitors like Cisco’s Splunk and ServiceNow.” The result? A category leader that’s being squeezed from above by bundlers and from below by insurgents — while the core market matures. PagerDuty pioneered on-call incident management. They defined the category. And they won it. But here’s the problem: Categories have natural sizes. The “core” incident management market isn’t infinite. Most companies that need sophisticated on-call rotation and alerting already have a solution. PagerDuty got most of the big ones. They tried to expand the TAM with: But these adjacencies haven’t moved the needle enough. The $36B TAM they cite in investor decks isn’t converting to $36B of real demand for PagerDuty specifically. When you dominate a category but the category stops growing, you have three options: 1. NRR is destiny. When NRR drops below 110%, alarm bells should go off. Below 100%, you’re in serious trouble. Monitor this metric religiously. 2. Customer count growth matters. Flat customer counts for 3 years isn’t a plateau — it’s a warning sign that your market may be saturated or your GTM motion is broken. 3. Profitability buys you time, not valuation. Getting to profitability is essential for survival. But don’t expect the market to reward efficiency alone. You still need growth. 4. Category size is a ceiling. If you’re dominating a $500M category, you’re going to be a ~$500M ARR company. Expanding the category is possible but brutally hard. 5. The “rule of 40” isn’t a multiple accelerator at low growth. 4% growth + 28% margins = 32, which is below 40. But even if it were above 40, a 4% grower trades very differently than a 30% grower with similar efficiency. PagerDuty built a great product. They serve real customers with real pain. They’re profitable and have a fortress balance sheet. And the market values them at 2-3x ARR because growth has stalled. This is the new reality of B2B and SaaS. Profitability is table stakes now. Efficiency is expected. What commands premium multiples is durable growth. If you can’t grow, you can still build a great business. But you won’t build a great stock. And you may end up selling for far less than you once dreamed. Profitable is not enough. You have to grow. Digging into PagerDuty’s Q3 FY26 investor presentation reveals a few more fascinating data points: 1. The Quarter-by-Quarter NRR Collapse is Stark The presentation shows the sequential decline in painful detail: Five straight quarters of decline. That’s not noise — that’s a trend. And it’s not bottoming out; it’s hitting the floor. 2. They Slashed Sales & Marketing from 53% to 30% of Revenue This is the real story behind the margin expansion. In FY20, PagerDuty spent 53% of revenue on sales and marketing. Today? Just 30%. That’s 23 percentage points cut from GTM investment. Yes, it helped margins. But it also helps explain why growth collapsed. You can’t cut your way to growth. 3. R&D Spend Dropped from 26% to 16% Similarly, R&D went from 26% of revenue in FY20 to just 16% today. When you’re being attacked by nimble startups and platform giants, cutting R&D by 10 points feels dangerous. PagerDuty is leaner, but is it still innovating fast enough? 4. They Claim a $50B TAM with Only ~1% Penetration The investor deck cites 87 million potential users across developers (30M), infrastructure ops (23M), customer service (28M), and SecOps (6M) — and claims only ~1% penetration. If true, that’s massive upside. But if you’re only penetrating 1% of a $50B market after 15 years and you’re growing 5%… something doesn’t add up. Either the TAM is overstated or the go-to-market isn’t working. 5. They’ve Tried to Buy Growth — Rundeck (2020), Catalytic (2022), Jeli (2023) The innovation timeline reveals a string of acquisitions: Rundeck for automation in 2020, Catalytic for no-code workflows in 2022, and Jeli for post-incident learning in 2023. These were bets on expanding beyond core incident management. But three years later, growth is still stalling. Acquisitions alone can’t fix a slowing core business — they have to be integrated and monetized. The jury is still out.

More Cyber Monday home tech deals: Cyber Monday falls on Dec. 1 this year, which means it is today. The shopping day always lands on the Monday right after Thanksgiving, and as expected, hundreds of price cuts and major online sales are live across the biggest retailers. However, the day is almost over, and deals are already disappearing. If you've got your eye on something, now is the time to shop. Almost all major retailers offer tons of deals and discounts for Cyber Monday. Think of companies like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart and Target, as well as more specialized retailers such as B&H Photo, GameStop and Dell. Keep in mind that physical locations can also run out of stock, so there are pros and cons to shopping in‑store and online. Cyber Monday sales are running right now, but they won't linger much longer. Many retailers launched their deals last week for Black Friday, and although that's now behind us, plenty of fresh discounts have been rolling in for Cyber Monday. But as the day starts winding down, so will the sales. Some CNET readers are concerned about tariffs and how they could affect holiday shopping. It’s possible tariffs could impact pricing, as we’ve seen related hikes in the past, including on Nintendo Switch consoles. But that doesn’t mean you can’t find great deals on tech and other items. The best way to determine if you’re getting a good deal is to track the item’s price history before making a purchase. Tools like CamelCamelCamel and Price Tracker, or the Keepa browser extension can help. We’ve rounded up several useful shopping resources, and we’ll highlight the best deals we find throughout the event. Not necessarily. Cyber Monday focuses largely on tech, home and lifestyle deals that exist both in person and online. While it started as an online alternative to Black Friday, the two events have blended together as more shopping moves online. That doesn’t mean all the deals are identical, but it does mean finding fresh discounts has become more challenging. The term “black” has historically been used to denote distressing or calamitous events. The earliest known use of Black Friday for the Friday after Thanksgiving was to describe workers calling in sick the day after Thanksgiving in the early 1950s. Around that same time, US police adopted the term to describe the traffic conditions during the first major holiday shopping date. After attempts to rebrand it as “Big Friday” failed, merchants reframed Black Friday as a positive -- the profits generated put stores “back in the black” financially. Then, in 2005, the National Retail Federation coined the term “Cyber Monday” after noticing a spike in online traffic the Monday following Thanksgiving. At the time, it was believed shoppers were making online purchases at work to hide gifts from kids and take advantage of faster internet connections. Other names like “Black Monday” or “Blue Monday” were floated, but “Cyber Monday” stuck. By 2014, Cyber Monday had become the biggest online shopping day in the US.

Title: Bitcoin’s bull market: A slowdown, not a breakdown

Time Published: 2025-11-30T13:04:02Z

ETF flows, stablecoins, and leverage have all cooled at once, forcing Bitcoin to run without its usual turbo boost. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin’s big buyers seem to have stepped off the gas. For the better part of the last year or so, it felt like there was a constant tailwind behind Bitcoin’s price. ETFs vacuumed up coins, stablecoin balances kept climbing, and traders were willing to go to insane levels of leverage to bet on more upside. NYDIG called these the “demand engines” of the cycle in its latest report. The company argued that several of those engines have reversed course: ETFs are seeing net outflows, the stablecoin base has stalled, and futures markets look cautious. That sounds rather ominous if you only read the headline. Unfortunately, as always, the truth is always somewhere in the middle. We will walk through each of those engines, keep the focus on dollars in and out, and end with the practical question everyone cares about: if the big machines are really slowing, does it break the bull market or slow it down? The simplest engine to understand is the ETF pipe. Since their launch in January 2024, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have brought in tens of billions of dollars in net inflows. That money came from advisers, hedge funds, family offices, and retail investors who chose a brokerage ticker as their preferred method of Bitcoin exposure. The crucial detail is that they were net buyers almost every week for most of the year. But that pattern broke over the past month. On several days in November, the ETF complex logged heavy redemptions, including some of the largest outflows since launch. A few of the funds that had been reliable buyers (think BlackRock) flipped to net sellers. For anyone looking at a single day of data, it sure could have felt like the entire ETF market blew up. The longer view is, of course, less dramatic but important nevertheless. Cumulative flows are still deeply positive, and all funds still hold a huge pool of Bitcoin. What changed is the direction of marginal money: instead of new cash flowing steadily in, some investors are taking profits, cutting exposure or moving into other trades. That means spot price no longer has a constant mechanical buyer sitting underneath it. A lot of that behavior is tied to how investors now hedge and manage risk. Once regulators allowed much higher position limits on ETF options (from 25,000 to 250,000 contracts), institutions could run covered-call strategies and other overlays on top of their ETF holdings. That gave them more ways to adjust risk without dumping shares, but also drained some of the pure “buy and hold at any price” energy. When price surged toward the top, some investors capped their upside for income. When price rolled over, others used the same options market to hedge instead of adding more spot. The second engine sits in stablecoins. If ETFs are the Wall Street-friendly funnel into Bitcoin, stablecoins are the crypto-native cash pile that lives inside the system. When USDT, USDC, and peers grow, it usually means more fresh dollars are arriving or at least being parked on exchanges ready to deploy. For much of the last year, Bitcoin’s big legs higher lined up with a growing stablecoin base. That pattern is wobbling, as the total stablecoin supply has stopped growing and even shrunk a little in the past month. Different trackers disagree on the exact amount, but the drop is clear enough. Some of that can be put down to simple risk reduction: traders pulling money out of exchanges, funds rotating into Treasuries, and smaller tokens losing market share. But some of it is real withdrawal of capital from the market. The takeaway here is straightforward: the pool of digital dollars that can chase Bitcoin higher is no longer expanding. That doesn’t automatically push price down, but it does mean every rally has to be funded out of a more or less fixed pot. There’s less “new money” sloshing around on exchanges that can instantly flood into BTC when sentiment turns. The third engine lives in derivatives. Funding rates on perpetual futures are a fee that traders pay to keep those contracts in line with spot price. When funding is strongly positive, it usually means many traders are long with leverage and are paying to stay that way. When funding goes negative, shorts are paying longs and the market is skewed toward bets on downside. The “basis” on regulated futures like CME is simply the gap between futures and spot. A big positive basis usually shows strong demand to be long with leverage. NYDIG points out that both of these gauges have cooled. Funding on offshore perpetuals has flipped negative at times. CME futures premia have compressed. Open interest is lower than it was at the peak. This tells us a lot of leveraged longs were washed out in the recent drawdown and haven’t rushed back. Traders are more cautious, and in some pockets they’re now willing to pay for downside protection instead of upside exposure. This matters for two reasons. First, leveraged buyers are often the marginal force that takes a move from a healthy uptrend to a vertical blow-off. If they’re nursing losses or sitting on the sidelines, moves tend to be slower, choppier and significantly less fun for anyone hoping for instant all-time highs. Second, when leverage builds in one direction, it can amplify both gains and crashes. A market with less leverage can still move a lot, but it’s less prone to sudden air pockets triggered by liquidations. So if ETFs are leaking, stablecoins are flat, and derivatives traders are cautious, who’s on the other side of this selloff? Here is where the picture becomes more subtle. On-chain data and exchange metrics suggest that some long-term holders have used the recent volatility to take profits. Coins that sat dormant for long periods have started to move again. At the same time, there are signs that newer wallets and smaller buyers are quietly accumulating. Some address clusters that rarely spend have also added to their balances. And some retail flows on large exchanges still lean toward net buying on the worst days. That is the core of NYDIG’s “reversal, not doom” framing. The most visible, headline-friendly demand engines have shifted into reverse just as price cooled. Underneath that, there’s still a slow transfer from older, richer cohorts to newer ones. The flow of this money is choppier and less mechanical than the ETF boom period, which makes the market feel harsher for anyone who arrived late. But it isn’t the same thing as capital vanishing altogether. First, the easy mode is more or less gone for now. For much of the year, ETF inflows and growing stablecoin balances acted like a one-way escalator. You didn’t need to know much about futures funding or options limits to understand why price kept grinding higher, because new money kept arriving. That background bid has faded and, in some weeks, flipped into net selling, making drawdowns feel heavier and rallies harder to sustain. Second, a slowdown in demand engines does’t automatically kill a cycle. Bitcoin’s long-run case still revolves around fixed supply, growing institutional rails and a steady expansion of places where it can sit on balance sheets, and those structures are still in place. What changes is the path between here and the next high. Instead of a straight line driven by one giant narrative, the market will start trading more on positioning and pockets of liquidity. ETF flows may swing between red and green, stablecoins may bounce around a plateau instead of sprinting higher, and derivatives markets may spend more time in neutral. That kind of environment rewards patience more than bravado. Finally, if you zoom out, reversals in the demand engines are part of how every cycle breathes. Heavy inflows set the stage for overextension, but then outflows and cooling leverage force a reset. New buyers arrive at lower prices, usually quieter and with less fanfare. NYDIG’s argument is that Bitcoin is somewhere in that reset phase, and the data supports that view. The engines that drove the first leg of the bull run are running slower, some in reverse, but it doesn’t mean the machine is broken. It means the next leg will depend less on automatic pipes and more on whether investors still want to own this thing once the easy part has passed.

Title: Advisors Are Watching These Tax Law Changes in 2026

New tax laws including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act present novel risks and opportunities when filing next year’s tax returns. Jeff Benjamin Guest Contributor to The Daily Upside The holiday season is full of traditions: travel, turkey and occasionally too much eggnog. But for advisors, there’s another (arguably less fun) annual ritual: year-end tax management. Even with about a month left in the calendar year, financial advisors say there are plenty of ways clients can and should prepare for the end of 2025 and the start of 2026. From new guidelines and tax laws related to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed into law in July, to standard tax-loss harvesting strategies, advisors say there is a lot to focus on during the final weeks of the year. “There are some new limitations … going into effect in 2026, which should be considered carefully before yearend,” said Kathy Buchs, Senior Tax Advisor at MAI Capital Management. The One Big Beautiful Bill, which comprehensively reshaped tax legislation and government spending, “created some additional complexities surrounding itemized deductions for 2025 and 2026,” Buchs said. For example, the law reduced deductible charitable contributions by 0.5% of adjusted gross income and reduced the charitable deduction of high-income taxpayers to 35 cents of tax benefit per dollar donated from 37 cents. “Because of these limitations, which go into effect in 2026, many clients are choosing to accelerate their charitable contributions into 2025 to fully benefit from their charitable giving,” Buchs said. “Many of them are also utilizing donor-advised funds to preserve flexibility for future grant-making.” Donor-advised funds act like a personal tax-advantaged investment account dedicated to supporting qualified charities. Patrick Sabol, Senior Lead Planner at Facet, describes charitable contributions as one of the most effective ways to reduce your tax liability. “You can do this by donating cash or appreciated securities directly to your charity of choice or potentially by using a Donor-Advised Fund,” he added. Sabol said one area that can sometimes be overlooked when focusing on more sophisticated strategies is simply maxing out contributions to pre-tax 401(k) and Health Savings Account plans. While charitable deductions will be capped starting next year at a 35% rate, taxpayers are getting some new relief in the area of state and local tax deductions, commonly referred to as SALT. In 2024, the SALT deduction was capped at $10,000, but that has been increased to $40,000 for the tax years 2025 through 2029. The full $40,000 deduction starts phasing out at modified adjusted gross incomes of $500,000 for joint filers, and the SALT deduction drops back to $10,000 when adjusted gross income reaches $600,000, according to John Patterson, Wealth Management Advisor at OnePoint BFG Wealth Partners. “When it comes to year-end planning, there are several key dos and don’ts to keep in mind,” Patterson said. “Any charitable gifts should be finalized before December 31, and if your income has changed significantly this year, review your withholding or make estimated payments now to prevent penalties or surprises at tax time.” Other tax deductions introduced in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act include up to $12,500 for qualified overtime pay, up to $6,000 for those 65 and older even if they are taking the standard deduction, and up to $10,000 for interest paid on auto loans for qualified vehicles purchased in 2025. Gabriel Shahin, founder and chief executive of Falcon Wealth, said tax-loss harvesting is among the areas he never overlooks this time of year. “Those losses should be used to offset your ordinary income, not just your capital gains,” he said. “Selling gains to offset losses defeats the whole point of tax-loss harvesting.” Shahin said one mistake he sometimes sees is investors ignoring their taxable brokerage accounts. “That’s where you’re getting hit with taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains,” he explained. “With strategic withdrawals and coordinated Roth contributions, you can shift money into tax-free growth instead of bleeding taxes every year for no reason.” Lance Elrod, co-owner of Next Step Financial Transitions, said tax-loss harvesting should be a focus throughout the year, but always revisited at yearend. “In years like 2025, when there has been strong market performance, especially in certain sectors like tech and international stocks, it’s worth revisiting your overall allocation to make sure you haven’t drifted too far away from where you want your allocation to be,” he said. Feeling Crypto. With a growing focus on cryptocurrency investing, Elrod said that can also be a good place to find tax management opportunities. “The crypto space has had a rough two-month stretch and if you purchased any cryptocurrencies recently, you are likely at a loss,” he said. “Since cryptocurrencies are seen as property in the US, you do not have to worry about the wash-sale rule like you would for other investments.” In essence, Elrod explained, “if you feel strongly about your crypto position, you can sell today to capture the loss for tax purposes and repurchase the same position five minutes later and not have to worry about the sale being disallowed for tax purposes.” Make It a Roth. Virtually across the board, advisors say consideration should be given to Roth conversions. “Failing to factor in potential tax-bracket shifts may also cause you to miss valuable opportunities for Roth conversions,” said Patterson of OnePoint BFG Wealth Partners. “Consider Roth conversions to lock in future tax-free growth, but carefully manage conversion amounts to avoid tax-bracket creep,” he added. Sabol of Facet said a Roth conversion is not necessarily a tax minimization strategy in the short term, but it can be a major year-end opportunity that is often overlooked. “Towards the end of the year, we can better estimate what tax bracket we will end up in,” he added. “This is a great time to maximize the lower brackets and fill them up with a conversion if available.” Shahin of Falcon Wealth described Roth conversions as one of the best tools for people in their 70s. “You’re essentially prepaying taxes at today’s lower rates to avoid massive required minimum distributions later when rates go up,” he said. “With tax brackets scheduled to increase in 2026 and SALT relief expiring, real tax planning becomes essential, because you want to shrink that pre-tax balance now, not when your RMDs force the issue.” PE will continue to dominate, but medium-sized sellers may fill in the gaps. Client risk aversion shifts constantly, and advisors must navigate those changes while technology becomes more prominent in investment management. Financial advisors learn to love the turnkey solutions with customizable options. The most significant benefits went to savers with bigger balances and higher contribution rates. Crypto’s exclusion further highlights the complete 180 Paul Atkins’s SEC has done on multiple issues from the previous administration. Thin margins are one reason, but the shutdowns don’t necessarily spell the end of automated advice. The recordkeeper said third-party fintech platforms used by advisors to access clients’ 401(k)s create security risks. Outside of some high-net-worth clients’ portfolios, tokenized assets are not yet the norm among advisors. Clients are utilizing, on average, less than half of the average services their firms offer. The company’s chief investment strategist warned policy moves can take months or years to ripple through the broader economy. Portfolios with a mix of domestic and foreign stocks could be a more optimal way of diversifying than holding bonds, regardless of age, research suggests. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Have you ever wondered how Amazon manages to deliver billions of packages a day across the globe? One center in the UK is already gearing up for the Christmas season, with a highly synchronized operation of moving robots, conveyor belts and storage towers. (AP Video: Mustakim Hasnath) Amazon’s generative AI-powered shopping assistant, Rufus, appears on a computer monitor, Dec. 1, 2024, in New York. (AP Photo/Peter Morgan, File) The OpenAI logo is seen displayed on a cell phone in front of an image on a computer screen generated by ChatGPT’s Dall-E text-to-image model, Friday, Dec. 8, 2023, in Boston. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, file) NEW YORK (AP) — Major retail chains and tech companies are offering new or updated artificial intelligence tools in time for the holiday shopping season, hoping to give consumers an easier gift-buying experience and themselves an augmented share of online spending. Although AI-powered purchases are in early stages, the shopping assistants and agents rolled out by the likes of Walmart, Amazon and Google can do more than the chatbots of holidays past. The latest versions were designed to provide personalized product recommendations, track prices and to place some orders through unscripted “conversations” with customers. Those features are on top of shopping updates from AI platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google Gemini. In one of the season’s most talked-about launches, Google this month introduced an AI agent that can be instructed to call local stores to ask if a desired product is in stock. San Francisco software company Salesforce estimated that AI would influence $73 billion, or 22%, of all global sales in one way or another from the Tuesday before Thanksgiving through Monday after the holiday, according to Caila Schwartz, Salesforce’s director of consumer insights. The figure, which stood at $60 billion a year ago, encompasses everything from a ChatGPT query to AI-supplied gift suggestions on a retailer’s website, Schwartz said. Despite the advancements, AI’s impact on holiday shopping will be “relatively limited” this year since not every shopping site has useful tools and not every shopper is willing to try them, said Brad Jashinsky, a senior retail industry analyst at information technology research and consulting firm Gartner. “The more retailers that launch these tools, the better they get, and the more that consumers get comfortable and start to seek them out,” Jashinsky said. “But customer behavior takes a long time to change.” Here are three ways the technology is poised to influence holiday shopping habits in 2025: AI’s potential to simplify the search for the perfect present is most apparent so far in tools that promise to give shoppers faster and more detailed results than a web browser with a lot fewer clicks. OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT with a shopping research feature that provides personalized buyers’ guides. The information comes from product pages, reviews. prices and a user’s previous interactions with the chatbot. The tool works best for complicated products like electronics and appliances, or for “detail-heavy” items like beauty or sporting goods, OpenAI said. Then there’s Rufus, the shopping assistant that Amazon rolled out last year. It now remembers information customers previously fed it, like having four children that all like board games, for example. A user’s browsing and purchase history and reviews are used to personalize recommendations. Google upgraded its AI Mode search tool to provide answers to detailed questions composed in natural language. For example, users can tell the agent they want to buy a casual sweater to wear with skirt or jeans in New York in January that goes with a skirt or jeans, Responses are pulled from Google’s 50 billion product listings. The tool can also produce charts with side-by-side comparisons of prices, features, reviews and other factors. Previously, shoppers had to use keywords, filters and product links to find the information they needed. “This is an expansionary moment, I think, for all of technology and for commerce,” Lilian Rincon, vice president of product, consumer shopping at Google, recently told The Associated Press. Meanwhile, Walmart’s AI shopping assistant, Sparky, offers occasion-based recommendations and synthesizes reviews. An AI-powered gift finder on Target’s app exclusively for the holidays responds to prompts such as the age and special hobbies of the recipient. Tools for tracking online prices have been around for years, including CamelCamelCamel, a third-party service for Amazon prices, as well as Paypal’s Honey browser extension for monitoring thousands of online shops. This holiday season, shoppers have new options. Amazon launched a 90-day pricing history tracker this month for virtually everything it sells. Shoppers also now can set up alerts to receive notifications when prices on specific items fall within their budgets. Google, which for years had a basic price tracker, launched a more advanced version that lets users refine their requests with details like a garment’s size and color. Microsoft’s Copilot also launched a price tracker this year. Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at Publicis Groupe, said he thinks the new pricing tools will add more pressure on retailers to make sure their prices are competitive. “A lot of consumers that weren’t even looking for price alerts are going to discover price alerts for the first time,” Goldberg predicted. Amazon, OpenAI and Google are racing to create tools that would allow for seamless AI-powered shopping by taking consumers from browsing to buying within the same program instead of having to go to a retailer’s website to complete a purchase. OpenAI launched a new instant checkout feature that lets users buy products suggested by ChatGPT without leaving the app. Users can order merchandise from Etsy sellers and from some brands that use Shopify, including Glossier, Skims and Spanx. OpenAI and Walmart announced a similar deal in October, saying the partnership would allow ChatGPT members to use the instant checkout feature to shop for nearly everything available on Walmart’s website except for fresh food. For now, however, the feature only supports buying one item at a time. A different deal Target struck with OpenAI lets shoppers put multiple items in a cart on ChatGPT, including fresh food products. But when customers are ready to pay for their orders, they are directed away from the chatbot to the Target app. New tools from Amazon and Google will give shoppers a taste of having autonomous AI assistants do the buying for them. While the services still are limited, “agentic AI” is intended to be more independent and advanced than the generative AI chatbots that excel at research and writing, experts say. Amazon is now letting Rufus automatically purchase items for customers who click an “auto buy” button while setting up price alerts. Once a product’s price drops to the desired level, customers receive notice of their completed orders and have a limited window to cancel, the company said. The e-commerce giant also started allowing shoppers to use Rufus searches for brand-name products on the Amazon app as a gateway to other retailers. If Amazon doesn’t carry a desired item in its store, a “Shop Direct” button will take them to the website of a place that does. Google’s AI Mode price tracker also includes a “buy for me” option that automatically makes a customer’s purchase through Google Pay when the price is right. The feature is available for products sold by Wayfair, Chewy, Quince and some Shopify merchants, and Google expects to keep adding more stores, the company said. sellers. Google also expanded its web browser with an automated AI call feature that phones local businesses on behalf of customers looking for information or specific products. Google’s program discloses to the store that it’s an AI caller, and stores can choose not to participate, the company said. Google said it’s applying the feature initially to specific product categories: toys, health and beauty, and electronics. Target and Walmart declined to comment on whether this type of service would be part of their future plans. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs Are Now BlackRock’s Biggest Revenue Drivers, Surpassing Older ETFs

BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become the asset manager’s top revenue source, according to Cristiano Castro, the director of business development at BlackRock Brazil, surpassing products that have been generating revenue for over two decades. This is a huge feat for BTC, given the company manages more than 1,400 exchange-traded funds globally and is the world’s largest asset manager with over $13.4 trillion in assets under management. Speaking at the Blockchain Conference 2025 in São Paulo, Castro called their growth “a big surprise” and said that allocations in BlackRock’s Bitcoin funds, including the U.S.-based iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Brazil’s IBIT39, had surged to $100 billion this year. IBIT, which began trading in January of last year alongside roughly a dozen Bitcoin ETFs, currently has around $70.73 billion in assets under management, according to data source SoSoValue, making it by far the most popular exchange-traded fund to track the BTC price. “When we launched, we were optimistic,” Castro said, “but we didn’t expect this scale.” IBIT’s net inflows surpassed $52 billion in its first year, far outshining all other ETFs that debuted over the past decade. The Bitcoin fund is also estimated to have generated approximately $245 million in annual fees by October 2025. A wave of institutional demand following the U.S. regulatory approval of spot BTC funds has largely driven IBIT’s strong growth. BlackRock now owns around 3.9% of Bitcoin’s 21 million supply. Castro’s remarks come on the heels of a rollercoaster month for BlackRock’s US-listed IBIT, which witnessed a staggering $2.34 billion in withdrawals this November. The biggest capital exits occurred mid-month, with the fund shedding approximately $463 million on Nov. 14 and around $523 million exiting on Nov. 18 — extending their outflow streak. According to Castro, such brutal outflows are expected given how retail investors react to price drawdowns. “ETFs are very liquid and powerful instruments,” Castro reportedly told local media at the Blockchain Conference. “They exist to let people allocate capital and manage cash flow. What we’ve been seeing is perfectly normal; any asset that starts to experience compression usually has this effect, especially in an instrument that is heavily controlled by retail investors.” Bitcoin has retreated sharply from its October $126,080 all-time high, trading around $91,331 at press time and testing the conviction of newer ETF entrants who purchased near the highs.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Cyber Monday is here, and there are lots of deals to choose from, including these excellent discounts on the Apple products we recommend: Today’s best Apple deals: U.S. Today’s best Apple deals: U.K. Updated December 1: We have reviewed the best prices and found more price drops and changes. We will be regularly monitoring the best prices and will update this article throughout Cyber Monday. ‘Tis the season for savings! Whether you’re looking for a deal on an iPad, Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods, or anything else Apple sells, there’s no better time to get one for cheap than Black Friday. The annual shopping extravaganza officially kicked off on Friday, but many of the best deals will last until today, AKA Cyber Monday on December 1. Every retailer that sells Apple gear gets in on the fun, and we are rounding up only the best deals we find right here. We regularly check prices using various tools to get a view of the very best prices right now, compared to what they were over the past days, weeks, and months, so we know an excellent deal when we see it. We’re checking and updating these prices all weekend, so mark this page and return often so you don’t miss a good deal, some of which are short-lived. Even Apple runs its own Black Friday shopping event, where it offers gift cards on certain purchases, including $50 with AirPods Pro 3, $100 for iPad Air, and $250 with a MacBook Pro. The bottom line is that there are lots of deals to be found right now, so no matter what Apple device you’re looking for, you will be able to make a saving. So take a look at the deals on all of Apple’s products below. Also, check our Best Picks round-ups, where you can find reviews of all the products we recommend. At Macworld we’ve been covering and reviewing Apple and Apple devices for more than 40 years, from the original Macintosh to the most recent M5 MacBook Pro and iPhone 17 lineup. We use Apple products every day and purchase them with our own money, so we know a good deal when we see one. More importantly, we also know how to spot a bad deal. With a working knowledge of everything Apple sells and decades of experience, we know when stores are inflating prices or pushing “normal” sales as limited Black Friday deals, so the listings you see here will only be for discounts that are at or near all-time low prices. Macworld Cyber Monday tip: While shopping during the Black Friday sales, we’ve noticed that on Amazon, if you delay your delivery date, there are additional 2-3% savings to be had. This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart, then it can add up to decent savings. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than last Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $150 off it’s a good saving (but it was $200 earlier in the Black Friday sale). We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 did dip as low as $139 at Walmart, but that deal seems to have ended now, the next best option is $189 on Amazon. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 was superb, but stock seems to have run out now (check to see if the model is user). You can still get AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation for less than $100, which is an excellent deal. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that AirPods deals sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers can save money on the AirPods Pro 2, currently at £169 with Argos, but we’ve also seen them at that price on Amazon (but they go out of stock quickly!). Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’ve seen $150 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. The standard entry-level iPad A16 is an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $275, but stock is dwindling, so if you want one act fast. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) (which has run out now) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Cyber Monday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or £74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 off/£20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats. You might also find some deals among our best earbuds for iPhones and Best over-ear headphones. U.S. U.K. Apple holds a shopping event every Black Friday, but it doesn’t offer actual discounts. Instead, Apple gives away gift cards when you buy certain products, which can be used on a future purchase. In 2025, Apple is offering the following gift card values over Black Friday weekend: This years deal is better than last year’s, with a maximum of $250/£200 being given away in the form of gift vouchers, and in some cases, such as the iPhones, we are seeing better savings via Apple than elsewhere.

Title: Ethereum Leverage Reset Complete – Time For Market Re-Accumulation?
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-leverage-reset-complete-time-for-market-re-accumulation/
Time Published: 2025-11-30T09:00:56Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum presently trades around $3,000 following a broader crypto market rebound in the last week. During this time, the market’s largest altcoin gained by 7.22%, providing a much-needed relief after an extended correction that dominated the majority of the last two months. As price stabilizes, crypto analytics platform XWIN Research Japan shares a forward-looking assessment of Ethereum’s outlook, especially considering developments in the futures market. Amid the widespread correction of the crypto market in Q4 2025, Ethereum’s prices crashed from $4,700 to as low as $2,900, representing a 38% price decline. XWIN Research Japan reports this price fall coincided with certain relevant developments in the futures market. In particular, Ethereum’s open interest across all exchanges dropped from $21 billion to around $17 billion in late November, as overleveraged long positions were closed down, forcing traders to open new positions with moderate leverage size. Meanwhile, funding rates stayed positive but declined to around 0.002, meaning that the dominant bullish sentiment from mid-2025 greatly reduced. Looking at on-chain data, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) is at 1.27, while Binance data shows it to be around 1.0, both values indicating Ethereum is in a neutral to fair value zone, suggesting a period of stability before the next major trend emerges. Meanwhile, the recent market recovery kick-started after ETH retested the realized price of whale addresses, indicating that large market players are bolstering their holdings. XWIN Research Japan supports this theory, noting that Ethereum Treasury BitMine has boosted its market holdings to 3.63 million ETH. Additionally, a BlackRock client recently acquired tens of millions of dollars’ worth of ETH, further reinforcing the strength of current market demand. However, despite this robust market demand, ETH Spot ETF net outflows for November hit $1.42 billion, indicating there is significant selling pressure in the market. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,003, reflecting a 0.22% loss in the past day. Despite its gains in the last week, the altcoin is still down by 22.34% over the last month, suggesting the majority of short-term holders are in losses. XWIN Research Japan explains that although the overleveraged position has been cleared out with market whales now ramping up their holding, Ethereum remains in a “bottom-building phase”. Therefore, investors should still anticipate a “choppy, sell-on-rally” price action in the short term. The analysts predict a major trend reversal with time as the current price area becomes increasingly attractive to investors for massive accumulation opportunities.

Title: BlackRock exec says ‘perfectly normal’ as IBIT sees $2.3B outflows in Nov
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-ibit-november-outflows-perfectly-normal-castro
Time Published: 2025-11-30T07:13:25Z
Full Content:
BlackRock says $2.34 billion in November outflows from IBIT are normal as demand once pushed the ETF near $100 billion. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) closed November under pressure after experiencing heavy withdrawals, but the asset manager remains confident in its long-term outlook for the product. Speaking in São Paulo, BlackRock business development director Cristiano Castro said the company’s Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs had become one of its biggest revenue drivers, calling their growth “a big surprise” given how fast allocations surged this year. Castro’s comments followed a rough month for BlackRock’s US-listed IBIT, which logged an estimated $2.34 billion in net outflows across November. The two largest withdrawals came mid-month, with about $523 million leaving on Nov. 18 and roughly $463 million on Nov. 14. “ETFs are very liquid and powerful instruments,” Castro reportedly said after his panel at the Blockchain Conference 2025. “They exist to let people allocate capital and manage cash flow. What we’ve been seeing is perfectly normal; any asset that starts to experience compression usually has this effect, especially in an instrument that is heavily controlled by retail investors.” Related: Different types of ETFs, explained - Cointelegraph Castro added that demand earlier in the cycle speaks for itself. Combined US and Brazil listings under the IBIT nameplate came “very close to $100 billion” in assets at their peak, he said. As Cointelegraph reported, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF holders returned to profit after Bitcoin climbed back above $90,000 on Thursday. Investors in BlackRock’s IBIT now sit on a cumulative gain of about $3.2 billion, reversing the losses seen during Bitcoin’s recent pullback. IBIT and BlackRock’s Ether ETF holders were up nearly $40 billion at their peak in early October before profits collapsed to just $630 million last week, meaning most positions were close to break-even until the latest rebound. Related: Why XRP ETF proposals are increasing and what is keeping other issuers on the sidelines Spot Bitcoin ETFs ended four weeks of heavy withdrawals with a $70 million weekly inflow, reversing part of the $4.35 billion that left the sector during November. Spot Ether (ETH) ETFs also rebounded, logging $312.6 million in weekly inflows after losing $1.74 billion over the previous three weeks.

Title: Overheard: ‘Gary took no prisoners’: man who egged bankers during depths of crash dies
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2025/11/30/gary-took-no-prisoners-man-who-egged-bankers-during-depths-of-crash-dies/
Time Published: 2025-11-30T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
Some people just capture the spirit of the age. Gary Keogh, the AIB shareholder who pelted the bank’s higher-ups with eggs in 2009 as all about him lost their heads, was one of them. He died last week. “I feel happier about the whole thing than I have done for months,” Keogh told The Irish Times in May 2009, in the immediate aftermath of the incident. He had lost €18,000 on his investment in AIB during the course of the crash and, at the age of 65, decided to make his displeasure known. He showed up to the emergency general meeting of the stressed bank and, amid very heated exchanges, targeted the then chief executive Eugene Sheehy and chairman Dermot Gleeson. Sheehy emerged clean, but Gleeson’s suit “sustained a direct eggy hit”, according to contemporary reporting. The bank was outlining a €3.5 billion government bailout at a time when shares had dropped from highs of €23.95 a share to 87 cent on the day – and had further to go before hitting rock bottom. A lot of people, including many at or near retirement age, lost a lot of money. Keogh, a former retail worker, had been buoyed by a kidney transplant, which freed him from dialysis and left him ready for action. “I think I got Che Guevara’s kidney,” he said. [ From the archive: Shareholder who threw eggs 'feels happier'Opens in new window ] It was a splatter heard around the world. International outlets such as the BBC and The Guardian included the colour amid global tales of financial woe, as an example of the reality beneath the eye-watering debt numbers. “Gary took no prisoners,” his wife Thelma told Overheard this week. Equipped with a dry sense of humour and a strong sense of fairness, the egg incident was absolutely within character. “That’s why he did it – because of the unfairness of it. He was a principled person. He didn’t want to see people being deceived.” Memories of the crash have slowly faded, but Gary’s legend lived on in Blackrock, south Dublin, where he was from, and where the egging was “one of the first things mentioned” at his funeral. The bankers and the national media found out about the plan before Thelma. “He didn’t even tell me. I knew nothing about these eggs, they were sitting in the garage for about a month. He had them in his pocket,” she said. “Afterwards he told me: ‘Turn on the radio.’ That’s how I found out.” After the incident, he told The Irish Times it was “the first” but wouldn’t be the last. True to his word, he took his protest to Bank of Ireland in 2011, firing at Pat Molloy and Richie Boucher – though on that occasion, he missed. Not every prominent Irish person abroad is necessarily as famous in their host country as they are at home – Ryan Tubridy and Evan Ferguson are good examples – but designer Paul Costelloe certainly made his mark. The Dubliner was a household name in certain British households because of his association with Princess Diana, whom he dressed on several occasions.

[ Easygoing but disciplined - descriptions of Paul Costelloe’s clothes also applied to the manOpens in new window ] “The tenor sang, the heavens opened and Princess Diana was soaked, her blonde hair streaming down both sides of her face,” the piece began, going on to note some of the most chic Costelloe clobber in her archive. Some other details were fuzzier, however. At one point, Costelloe was described as “6ft, only a couple of inches taller than his royal client”, while later he was referred to as spending much of his time in “Monkstown, in southeast Dublin, where he could often be found sketching and doodling at Kehoe’s pub”. The Times, mostly hidden behind the paywall, still allows readers to comment online, and they rushed to make corrections. Gavin Costelloe, Paul’s son, commented: “Paul was 6’ 4”. Not 6’.” That would make him half a foot taller than the former Lady Spencer. Another commenter also weighed in: “ ... and Kehoe’s is not in Monkstown!” The pub, one of Dublin’s most storied, is of course on South Anne Street, metres from Grafton Street. Best wishes to the Parma farmers as Parmigiano Reggiano, the grateable hard cheese, signs up to a Hollywood agent with hopes of becoming a superstar. Europe’s favourite umami dust will go to work for the United Talent Agency, which reps the likes of Angelina Jolie, Channing Tatum and Mariah Carey. The plan is product placement, in order to “introduce Parmigiano Reggiano to a wide pool of partners, to further its message of gastronomical excellence”. Overheard, still chewing a lump of Durrus as we found this out, wondered why Irish cheeses aren’t out there furthering their own message of gastronomical excellence in superhero movies and so on. We asked Cáis, the Association of Irish Farmhouse Cheesemakers. “Most makers are small, family-run businesses focused on local markets,” said Eimear Cuddy, secretary of Cáis. “Many don’t export at all, so the logistics, cost and time involved in pursuing international product placement would outweigh any potential return.” But Ireland’s hardworking culture industry sometimes name-drops a cheese without some slick-haired Hollywood dealmaker taking their percentage. “There are occasional organic moments of exposure,” says Cuddy. “For example, Cashel Blue has been named in a Cecelia Ahern novel, in poetry and also on a quizshow without them ever seeking it – but nothing that would resemble a Hollywood placement strategy.” Busáras, the nation’s foremost coach station, divides opinion between those (Sinn Féin housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin) who consider it “Dublin’s most iconic mid-century modernist masterpiece” and those (authentic mid-century modernist Myles na gCopaleen) who consider it a “bust station”. Hoping to heal this rift, Bus Éireann is in the process of trying to renovate it sympathetically, modernising access and facilities while polishing up the original features.

Early stages, you’d have to conclude. What might they find? It’s well known that there’s a 225-seat theatre in the basement, with the Eblana having played host to the likes of John B Keane and Brian Friel over the years before shutting down in 1995. It won’t be back – the space will become a training centre for elite bus operatives – but who knows, there could be a museum or a funfair down there too. These modernists were utopian.

Google is winning the AI race – isn’t it? Recent headlines – “Why Google is winning the AI race”, “5 reasons Google has never looked stronger”, “Google is suddenly beating its magnificent seven peers in the AI race” – suggest as much. So does the share price of Google parent Alphabet: the stock is now up some 70 per cent this year, more than twice as big as Nvidia’s gains. Indeed, Alphabet’s market capitalisation recently came within touching distance of $4 trillion (€3.45 trillion), not far behind Nvidia and Apple. Google’s reputation has shifted from playing catch-up in AI to the possibility that it’s now setting the pace. How quickly market narratives can change. In July, Nvidia was worth almost twice as much as Alphabet, which at that point sat below Amazon in the rankings and only narrowly ahead of Facebook parent Meta. Just last month, Nvidia was valued at $5 trillion, $2 trillion more than Alphabet. By late November, the gap had shrunk to “just” $300 billion. Meanwhile, Alphabet’s near doubling over the last six months means it’s now worth more than twice as much as Meta. We see a similar dynamic with Apple. A year ago, it was the most valuable firm in the world and was the heavy favourite to become the world’s first $4 trillion company. The narrative changed abruptly; dismissed as an AI laggard, it was overtaken by Microsoft and then swept aside by Nvidia’s surge. [ No matter what AI tells today’s nostalgic teens, life in the 1990s wasn’t all betterOpens in new window ] Now the pendulum has swung again, with Apple recently climbing back to the point where it was within reach of Nvidia’s valuation. What looked like timidity and under-investment in AI now reads like capital discipline – for now anyway.

The two best models in the world, Anthropic’s Claude 4.5 Opus and Google’s Gemini 3 have the majority of their training and inference infrastructure on Google’s TPUs and Amazon’s Trainium. Now Google is selling TPUs physically to multiple firms. Is this the end of Nvidia’s dominance? The dawn of the AI era is here, and it is crucial to understand that the cost structure of AI-driven software deviates considerably from traditional software. Chip microarchitecture and system architecture play a vital role in the development and scalability of these innovative new forms of software. The hardware infrastructure on which AI software runs has a notably larger impact on Capex and Opex, and subsequently the gross margins, in contrast to earlier generations of software, where developer costs were relatively larger. Consequently, it is even more crucial to devote considerable attention to optimizing your AI infrastructure to be able to deploy AI software. Firms that have an advantage in infrastructure will also have an advantage in the ability to deploy and scale applications with AI. Google had peddled the idea of building AI-specific infrastructure as far back as 2006, but the problem came to a boiling point in 2013. They realized they needed to double the number of datacenters they had if they wanted to deploy AI at any scale. As such, they started laying the groundwork for their TPU chips which were put into production in 2016. It’s interesting to compare this to Amazon, who in the same year, realized they needed to build custom silicon too. In 2013, they started the Nitro Program, which was focused on developing silicon to optimize general-purpose CPU computing and storage. Two very different companies optimized their efforts for infrastructure for different eras of computing and software paradigms. We’ve long believed that the TPU is among the world’s best systems for AI training and inference, neck and neck with king of the jungle Nvidia. 2.5 years ago we wrote about TPU supremacy, and this thesis has proven to be very correct. TPU’s results speak for themselves: Gemini 3 is one of the best models in the world and was trained entirely on TPUs. In this report, we will talk about the huge changes in Google’s strategy to properly commercialize the TPU for external customers, becoming the newest and most threatening merchant silicon challenger to Nvidia. We plan to: (Re-)Educate our clients and new readers about the rapidly growing commercial success of external TPU customers, starting with Anthropic and extending to Meta, SSI, xAI and even potentially OpenAI... Show that: The more (TPU) you buy, the more (NVIDIA GPU capex) you save! OpenAI hasn’t even deployed TPU yet and already increased perf per TCO by getting ~30% off their compute fleet due to competitive threats Explain the circular economy deals for AI Infrastructure. Revisit our original TPU deep dive with a refresher on the TPU hardware stack from silicon down to the software layer. Cover the positive developments on the open software ecosystem front as well as the critical missing ingredient for Google to make the TPU ecosystem a viable challenger to the CUDA moat: open source their XLA:TPU compiler, runtime, and multi-pod “MegaScaler” code. In the paywall, we will discuss the implications for Nvidia’s moat and compare Vera Rubin to the next gen TPUv8AX/8X (aka Sunfish/Zebrafish) Also cover the long term threat to Nvidia. First, let’s talk about the impact this news has had on the ecosystem. TPU performance has clearly caught the attention of its rivals. Sam Altman has acknowledged “rough vibes” ahead for OpenAI as Gemini has stolen the thunder from OpenAI. Nvidia even put out a reassuring PR telling everyone to keep calm and carry on — we are well ahead of the competition. We understand why. These past few months have been win after win for the Google Deepmind, GCP, and TPU complex. The huge upwards revisions to TPU production volumes, Anthropic’s >1GW TPU buildout, SOTA models Gemini 3 and Opus 4.5 trained on TPU, and now an expanding list of clients being targeted (Meta, SSI, xAI, OAI) lining up for TPUs. This has driven a huge re-rating of the Google and TPU supply chain at the expense of the Nvidia GPU-focused supply chain. While the “sudden” emergence of Google and the TPU supply chain has caught many by surprise, SemiAnalysis institutional product subscribers have been anticipating this for the last year. Another reason Nvidia has been on the defensive is a growing chorus of skeptics who argue the company is propping up a “circular economy” by funding cash-burning AI startups, essentially moving money from one pocket to another with extra steps. We think this view is misplaced, but it has clearly struck a nerve inside Nvidia. The finance team issued a detailed response, reproduced below. We think a more realistic explanation is that Nvidia aims to protect its dominant position at the foundation labs by offering equity investment rather than cutting prices, which would lower Gross margins and cause widespread investor panic. Below, we outline the OpenAI and Anthropic arrangements to show how frontier labs can lower GPU TCO by buying, or threatening to buy TPUs. OpenAI hasn’t even deployed TPUs yet and they’ve already saved ~30% on their entire lab wide NVIDIA fleet. This demonstrates how the perf per TCO advantage of TPUs is so strong that you already get the gains from adopting TPUs even before turning one on. Our Accelerator Industry Model, Datacenter Industry Model and Core Research subscribers saw the industry implications well before this was announced and became market consensus. In early August, we shared with our Accelerator Model clients that we saw massive upward revisions for Broadcom / Google TPU orders in the supply chain for 2026. We also revealed that the reason for these order increases was the fact that Google would begin selling systems externally to multiple customers. In early September, we revealed that one of the big external customers will be Anthropic, with demand of at least 1 million TPUs. This was officially confirmed by Anthropic and Google in October. We also called out Meta as a big TPU customer on the 7th of November, weeks before others. In addition we have discussed other customers as well. As a result, our institutional clients have had plenty of heads up on one of the largest performance dispersions in the AI Trade to date. SemiAnalysis was the first to break all these insights because no other research firm can connect the dots from the fabs to supply chain through the datacenters to the labs. To get access to these insights as and stay ahead of the curve: sales@semianalysis.com Onto the deal. The TPU stack has long rivaled Nvidia’s AI hardware, yet it has mostly supported Google’s internal workloads. In typical Google fashion, it never fully commercialized the TPU even after making it available to GCP customers in 2018. That is starting to change. Over the past few months, Google has mobilized efforts across the whole stack to bring TPUs to external customers through GCP or by selling complete TPU systems as a merchant vendor. The search giant is leveraging its strong in-house silicon design capabilities to become a truly differentiated cloud provider. Furthermore, it aligns with marquis customer Anthropic’s continued push to diversify away from its dependence on NVDA. The Anthropic deal marks a major milestone in this push. We understand that GCP CEO Thomas Kurian played a central role in the negotiations. Google committed early by investing aggressively in Anthropic’s funding rounds, even agreeing to no voting rights and a 15% cap on their ownership to expand the use of TPUs beyond internal Google. This strategy was eased by the presence of former DeepMind TPU talent within the foundation lab, resulting in Anthropic training Sonnet and Opus 4.5 on multiple types of hardware including TPUs. Google has already built a substantial facility for Anthropic, as shown below as part of our building-by-building tracker of AI labs. Beyond renting capacity in Google datacenters through GCP, Anthropic will deploy TPUs in its own facilities, positioning Google to compete directly with Nvidia as a true merchant hardware vendor. In terms of the split of the 1M TPUs: The first phase of the deal covers 400k TPUv7 Ironwoods, worth ~$10 billion in finished racks that Broadcom will sell directly to Anthropic. Anthropic is the fourth customer referenced in Broadcom’s most recent earnings call. Fluidstack, a gold-rated ClusterMax Neocloud provider, will handle on-site setup, cabling, burn-in, acceptance testing, and remote hands work as Anthropic offloads managing physical servers. DC infrastructure will be supplied by TeraWulf (WULF) and Cipher Mining (CIFR). The remaining 600k TPUv7 units will be rented through GCP in a deal we estimate at $42 billion of RPO, accounting for most of the $49 billion increase in GCP’s backlog reported in the third quarter. We believe additional deals with Meta, OAI, SSI, and xAI could provide additional RPO + direct hardware sales for GCP in coming quarters. Despite heavy internal and external demand, Google has not been able to deploy TPUs at the pace it wants. Even though it has more control over its hardware supply than other hyperscalers that still need curry favor with Jensen, Google’s main bottleneck is power. While other hyperscalers have expanded their own sites and secured significant colocation capacity, Google has moved more slowly. We believe the core issue is contractual and administrative. Each new datacenter vendor requires a Master Services Agreement, and these are multibillion-dollar, multiyear commitments that naturally involve some bureaucracy. Yet Google’s process is especially slow, often taking up to three years from initial discussions to a signed MSA. Google’s workaround carries major implications for Neocloud providers and cryptominers looking to pivot to AI DC infrastructure. Instead of leasing directly, Google offers a credit backstop, an off-balance-sheet “IOU” to step in if Fluidstack cannot pay its datacenter rent. Neoclouds like Fluidstack are nimble and flexible, making it easier for them to deal with new datacenter vendors like reformed cryptominers. This mechanic has been key to our bullish views on the cryptomining industry – notably we were calling out numerous including IREN and Applied Digital at the beginning of the year when stock prices were materially lower. The opportunity for miners rests on a simple dynamic: the datacenter industry faces acute power constraints power, and cryptominers already control capacity through their PPAs and existing electrical infrastructure. We expect many more agreements to follow in the coming weeks and quarters. Prior to the Google/Fluidstack/TeraWulf deal, we had not seen any deal with a mere off-balance-sheet “IOU” in the Neocloud market. After the deal, we believe it has become the new de-facto standard financing template. This solves a key headache for Neoclouds looking to secure datacenter capacity and grow their business: A GPU cluster has a useful and economic life of 4-5years A large datacenter lease is typically 15+ years, with a typical payback period of ~8 years. This duration mismatch has made it very complicated for both Neoclouds and Datacenter vendors to secure financing for projects. But with the rise of the “hyperscaler backstop”, we believe the financing issues are solved. We expect a new wave of growth for the NeoCloud industry. Check out our Accelerator and Datacenter models to understand the key beneficiaries. These are the how’s and why’s behind the Anthropic deal, now let’s get into the hardware. Furthermore, Neoclouds who count Jensen as an investor such as CoreWeave, Nebius, Crusoe, Together, Lambda, Firmus, and Nscale all have a notable incentive to not adopt any competing technology in their datacenter: TPUs, AMD GPUs, or even Arista switches are off limits! This leaves a gaping hole in the market for TPU hosting that is currently filled by a combination of crypto miners + Fluidstack. In the coming months, we expect to see more Neoclouds make the tough decision between pursuing a growing TPU hosting opportunity and securing allocations of the latest and greatest Nvidia Rubin systems. The answer is simple. It is a strong chip inside an excellent system, and that combination offers compelling performance and TCO for Anthropic. 2.5 years ago, we wrote about Google’s compute infrastructure advantage. Even with silicon that lagged Nvidia’s on paper, Google’s system-level engineering allowed the TPU stack to match Nvidia in both performance and cost efficiency. We argued then that “systems matter more than microarchitecture,” and the past two years have reinforced that view. Anthropic’s massive TPU orders are a direct validation of the platform’s technical strength. The GPU ecosystem has shifted forward as well. Nvidia’s GB200 represents a major leap forward, pushing Nvidia toward becoming a true systems company that designs full servers rather than only the chip package inside. While we are on the topic of the GB200’s huge innovation in rack-scale interconnect, one underappreciated point is that Google has been scaling up TPUs within and across racks since TPU v2 back in 2017! Further down in the report, we feature a deep dive on Google’s ICI scale-up networking, the only real rival to Nvidia’s NVLink. Google’s recent Gemini 3 model is now viewed as the state of the art frontier LLM. Like all earlier versions of Gemini, it was trained entirely on TPUs. That result offers concrete proof of both TPU capability and Google’s broader infrastructure advantage. Today’s attention often centers on hardware for inference and post-training, yet pre-training a frontier model remains the hardest and most resource-intensive challenge in AI hardware. The TPU platform has passed that test decisively. This stands in sharp contrast to rivals: OpenAI’s leading researchers have not completed a successful full-scale pre-training run that was broadly deployed for a new frontier model since GPT-4o in May 2024, highlighting the significant technical hurdle that Google’s TPU fleet has managed to overcome. One of the key highlights of the new model include noticeable gains in tool calling and agentic capability, especially on longer-horizon tasks for economically valuable tasks. Vending Bench is an evaluation that aims to measure how well models would run a business over a long period of time by placing them as the owner of a simulated vending machine business and Gemini 3 destroyed the competition. This launch brought not just improved capabilities but new products. Antigravity, a product born from the acqui-hire of former Windsurf CEO Varun Mohan and team, is Google’s answer to OpenAI’s Codex, officially entering Gemini into the vibe coding token guzzling wars. For Google to quietly muscle in and establish a performance lead in one of the most challenging hardware problems is a truly impressive feat for a company whose core business isn’t, or should we say, wasn’t in hardware business. The corollary to “Systems matter more than Microarchitecture”, is that while Google has been pushing the boundary on system and networking design, TPU silicon itself wasn’t too ground-breaking. Since then, TPU silicon has made massive strides with the latest generations. From the outset, Google’s design philosophy has been more conservative on silicon relative to Nvidia. Historically, TPUs have shipped with significantly fewer peak theoretical FLOPs, and lower memory specs than corresponding Nvidia GPUs. There are 3 reasons for this. First, Google places a high internal emphasis on ‘RAS’ (Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability) for their infrastructure. Google prefers to sacrifice absolute performance in exchange for greater hardware uptime. Running things to the limit means higher instances of hardware mortality which has a real TCO impact in terms of system downtime and hot spares. After all, the hardware you cannot use has infinite TCO relative to performance. The second reason is that up until 2023, Google’s primary AI workload was recommendation system models to power their core Search and Ad properties. RecSys workloads carry much lower arithmetic intensity compared to LLM workloads which means fewer FLOPs are required relative to every bit of data that is transferred. The third comes down to the utility of “peak theoretical FLOPs” numbers that are marketed and how they can be manipulated. Merchant GPU providers like Nvidia and AMD want to market the best performance specifications possible for their chips. This incentivizes them to stretch marketed FLOPs to the highest number possible. In practice, these numbers are unable to be sustained. On the other hand, the TPU has primarily been internal facing, with much less pressure to inflate these specifications externally. This has important implications that we’ll discuss further. The generous way to look at it would be Nvidia is better at DVFS therefore happy to report peak specs only. After we ushered in the LLM era, there has been a clear shift in Google’s TPU design philosophy. We can see that with the 2 most recent TPU generations that were designed-post LLM: TPUv6 Trillium (Ghostlite) and TPUv7 Ironwood (Ghostfish) reflect that change. We can see in the chart below that for TPUv4 and v5, compute throughput was much lower than the Nvidia flagship at the time. TPUv6 came very close to the H100/H200 on FLOPs, but it came 2 years later than the H100. With TPU v7, the gap narrows further with servers available only a few quarters later, while delivering almost the same level of peak theoretical FLOPs. What drove these performance gains? Partially it’s that Google started announcing TPUs as they ramp into production rather then after the next generation was being deployed. Furthermore, TPU v6 Trillium is manufactured on the same N5 node as TPU v5p with similar silicon area but was able to deliver a whopping 2x increase in peak theoretical FLOPs with significantly less power! For Trillium, Google quadrupled the size of each systolic array to 256 x 256 tiles from 128 x 128, and this increase in array size is what has delivered the increase in compute. Trillium was also the last of the “E” (lite) SKUs which meant it was equipped with only 2 sites of HBM3. While Trillium closed the gap to Hopper on compute, it fell far short of the H100/H200 on memory capacity and bandwidth, with only 2 stacks of HBM3 vs 5 and 6 stacks of HBM3 and HBM3E respectively. This made it painful to use for novices, but the performance TCO achieved for Trillium is unbeatable if you get shard your model properly and utilize all those cheap FLOPS. TPU v7 Ironwood is the next iteration where Google nearly completely closes the gap to the corresponding Nvidia flagship GPU on FLOPs, memory, and bandwidth albeit with general availability 1 year later than Blackwell. Compared to the GB200, FLOPs and memory bandwidth only have a slight shortfall, with capacity being the same with 8-Hi HBM3E, which is of course a significant shortfall to GB300 which has 288GB of 12-Hi HBM3E. Theoretical absolute performance is one thing but what matters is real world performance per Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). While Google procures TPUs through Broadcom and pays a hefty margin, it is significantly less than the margin Nvidia earns on not only the GPUs they sell but entire the whole system including CPUs, Switches, NICs, system memory, cabling and connectors. From Google’s perspective this results in the all-in TCO per Ironwood chip for the full 3D Torus configuration being ~44% lower than the TCO of a GB200 server. This more than makes up for the ~10% shortfall on peak FLOPs and peak memory bandwidth. This is from the perspective of Google and the price they procure TPU servers at. What about Google’s external customers when Google adds their margin on top? We assume that in the case where Google earns a margin on leasing TPU 7 to external customers that the TCO per hour can still be up to ~30% lower than the cost of the GB200 and ~41% lower than the cost of the GB300. This is what we believe is reflective of Anthropic’s pricing via GCP. Comparing theoretical FLOPs tells only part of the story. What matters is effective FLOPs, since peak numbers are almost never reached in real-world workloads. In practice, Nvidia GPUs typically achieve only about a small portion of their theoretical peak once communication overhead, memory stalls, power limits, and other system effects are factored in. A good rule of thumb for training is 30%, but utilization also varies heavily by workload. A large share of the gap comes down to software and compiler efficiency. Nvidia’s advantage here stems from the CUDA moat and the wide set of open source libraries that come out of the box, helping workloads run efficiently with high realized FLOPs and memory bandwidth. The TPU software stack is not as easy to use, though this is beginning to change. Inside Google, TPUs benefit from excellent internal tooling that is not exposed to external customers, which makes out of the box performance weaker. However, this only applies to small and/or lazy users, and Anthropic is neither of those. Anthropic has strong engineering resources and ex-Google compiler experts who know both the TPU stack and understand their own model architecture well. They can invest in custom kernels to drive high TPU efficiency. As a result, they can reach substantially higher MFU and much better $/PFLOP performance. We believe that despite lower marketed peak FLOPs, TPUs can reach higher realized Model FLOP Utilization (MFU) than Blackwell, which translates into higher effective FLOPs for Ironwood. A major reason is that marketed GPU FLOPs from Nvidia and AMD are significantly inflated. Even in tests designed to maximize throughput through GEMMs shaped far from real workloads, Hopper only reached about ~80% of peak, Blackwell landed in the 70s, and AMD’s MI300 series in the 50s-60s. The limiting factor is power delivery. These chips cannot sustain the clock speeds used in the peak math. Nvidia and AMD implement Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling which means that the chip’s clock frequency is dynamically adjusted based on power consumption and thermals rather than a stable clock frequency that can actually be sustained. Nvidia and AMD then select the highest clock frequency that could possibly be delivered, even if very intermittently, to be used in the calculation of peak theoretical FLOPs (operations per cycle per ALU x number of ALUs x cycles per second i.e. clock frequency). There are other tricks that are employed, like running GEMMs on tensors filled with zeroes, as 0x0=0, the transistors don’t need to switch state from 0 to 1, therefore reducing the power draw of each operation. Of course, in the real world, zero-filled tensors are not multiplied together. When we put together much lower TCO and higher effective FLOPs utilization, from the perspective of Google the $ per effective FLOP becomes much cheaper, with ~15% MFU being the breakeven with GB300 at 30% MFU. This means if Google (or Anthropic) manages to hit half the FLOPs utilization of GB300, they still come out even. Of course, with Google’s elite compiler engineer team and deep understanding of their own models, the MFU they can realize on TPUs could be 40% potentially. That would be a whopping ~62% reduction in cost per effective training FLOP! However, when looking at the 600K rented TPUs, when we incorporate the higher TCO that Anthropic pays (ie inclusive of Google’s margin stacking) into this analysis, we estimate the cost to Anthropic to be $1.60 per TPU-hour from GCP, narrowing the TCO advantage. We believe that Anthropic can realize 40% MFU on TPUs due to both their focus on performance optimization as well as the TPU’s marketed FLOPs inherently being more realistic. This provides Anthropic with a staggering ~52% lower TCO per effective PFLOP compared to GB300 NVL72. The equilibrium where TCO per effective FLOP compared to the GB300 baseline is the same is at a much lower 19% extracted MFU for Anthropic. This means that Anthropic can suffer a sizeable performance shortfall relative to the baseline GB300 and the perf/TCO for training FLOPs still ends up being the same as the baseline Nvidia system. FLOPs are not the end all and be all for performance, memory bandwidth is super important for inference, especially on the bandwidth intensive decode step. It should be no surprise that $ per memory bandwidth for the TPU also ends up being much cheaper than GB300. There is significant evidence that at small message sizes such as 16MB to 64MB (loading an expert of a single layer), TPU’s even achieve higher memory bandwidth utilization then GPUs. All of this translates into more efficient compute to train and serve a model. Anthropic’s release of Opus 4.5 continued the usual focus on coding, setting a new SWE-Bench record. The main surprise was a ~67% price cut on the API. This price cut paired with the lower verbosity and higher token efficiency of the model compared to Sonnet (76% fewer tokens to match Sonnet’s best score, and 45% fewer to exceed it by 4 points) means Opus 4.5 is the best model for coding use cases and could effectively raise Anthropic’s realized token pricing as Sonnet is over 90% of token mix today. When it comes to pricing for external customers, Google needs to thread the needle to balance their own profitability whilst offering customers a competitive proposition. Our estimate for Anthropic pricing is on the lower end of ranges we’ve heard for external pricing. For a flagship customer such as Anthropic, who will provide valuable input into both the software and hardware roadmap whilst ordering a huge amount of volumes, we’d expect sweetheart pricing. While Nvidia’s eye-watering 4x markup (~75% gross margin) offers a lot of room for pricing flexibility, a good amount of oxygen is sucked away by Broadcom. Broadcom, as the TPU’s co-designer, earns a high margin on the silicon which is the largest component of system BOM. Still, this leaves a lot of room for Google to earn very good acceptable margins. We can see this from comparing the GCP Anthropic deal to other large GPU-based cloud deals. Note that this is looking at the 600k TPUs that is being rented with the remaining 400k TPU v7 chips being bought upfront by Anthropic. Under these assumptions, the TPU v7 economics show superior EBIT margins than the other large GPU-based cloud deals we have observed, with only OCI-OpenAI coming close. Even with Broadcom’s margin stack on the chip-level BOM, Google can still eke out far superior margins and returns than much more commoditized GPU deals. This is where the TPU stack allows GCP to be a truly differentiated CSP. Meanwhile someone like Microsoft Azure, whose ASIC program is struggling, is confined to earning more mediocre returns in the mere business of leasing merchant hardware. We’ve so far discussed how TPUs compare to Nvidia GPUs, focusing on per chip specs and the shortcomings. Now, let’s get back to the system discussion which is where TPU’s capabilities really start to diverge. One of the most distinctive features of the TPU is its extremely large scale up world size through the ICI protocol. The world size of a TPU pod reaches 9216 Ironwood TPUs, with large pod sizes being a feature of TPUs as early as TPUv2 back in 2017 scaling up to a full 256 1024-chip cluster size. Let’s start at the rack level, the basic building block of each TPU superpod. The TPU rack has a similar design over the last couple of generations. Each rack consists of 16 TPU Trays, 16 or 8 Host CPU Trays depending on the cooling configuration, a ToR Switch, power supply units, and BBUs. Each TPU tray consists of 1 TPU board with 4 TPU chip packages mounted. Each Ironwood TPU will have 4 OSFP cages for ICI connections and 1 CDFP PCIe cage for the connection to the Host CPU. Google has been implementing liquid cooled TPU racks since TPU v3 in 2018, but there are still some TPU generations in between that were designed to be air-cooled. The main difference between the liquid cooled and the air-cooled rack is that the air-cooled rack has 2 TPU trays to 1 host CPU tray ratio while the liquid cooled rack has a 1 to 1 ratio instead. An innovative design of TPU’s liquid cooling is that the flow rate of the coolant is actively controlled by the valves. This enables much more efficient cooling as the flow can be adjusted depending on the amount of workload that each chip has at any given time. Google’s TPU has also long adopted vertical power delivery, in which the VRM modules of the TPUs are on the other side of the PCB board. These VRM modules also require a cold plate for cooling. Overall, the TPU rack design is much simpler than that of the Nvidia Oberon NVL72 design, which has a much higher density and utilizes a backplane to connect GPUs to scale up switches. The scale up connections between the TPU trays are all over external copper cables or optics, which will be explained in the ICI section below. The connection between the TPU tray and the CPU tray is also over PCIe DAC cable. The building block of Google’s ICI scale-up network for TPUv7 is a 4x4x4 3D torus consisting of 64 TPUs. Each 4x4x4 cube of 64 TPUs maps to one physical rack of 64 TPUs. This is an ideal dimension as all 64 TPUs can be connected electrically to each other and still fit in a physical rack. The TPUs are connected to each other in a 3D torus configuration, with each TPU connecting to 6 neighbors total – 2 logically adjacent neighboring TPUs for each of the X, Y and Z axes. Each TPU is always connected to 2 other TPUs via PCB traces within the compute tray but depending on where the TPU is located within the 4x4x4 cube, it will connect to 4 other neighbors either via Direct Attach Copper (DAC) cables or via an Optical Transceiver. Connections within the interior of the 4x4x4 cube happen over copper, while connections outside of the 4x4x4 cube (including wrap-around connections back to the other side of the cube as well as connections to neighboring 4x4x4 cubes) will use optical transceivers and OCSs. In the below diagram, we see that as this is a 3D Torus network: TPU 2,3,4 (on the Z+ face) has a wraparound connection back to the opposite Z-axis face to TPU 2,3,1 (on the Z- face) using an 800G optical transceiver and routing through an OCS. As mentioned above, in addition to the 2 neighboring TPUs that are always connected via PCB traces, TPUs will connect to 4 other neighbors using DACs, transceivers or a mix of both depending on where in the 4x4x4 cube they are. TPUs in the interior of the 4x4x4 cube will connect to the 4 other neighbors exclusively using DACs, TPUs on the face of the cube will connect via 3 DACs and 1 optical transceiver, TPUs on the edge of the cube will connect via 2 optical transceivers and 2 DACs, while TPUs on the corners will connect via 1 DAC and 3 optical transceivers. You can remember how many transceivers a given TPU will use by looking at how many of the TPU’s sides are facing the “outside” of the cube. The diagram above, as well as the table below, summarizes the number of respective location types for TPUs and can be used to derive the attach ratio of 1.5 Optical Transceivers per TPU v7. These transceivers connect to Optical Circuit Switches (OCSs) which enable connections between 4x4x4 cubes – more on that in the next section. Google adopts a software-defined networking approach to manage network routes through Optical Circuit Switches (OCSs). An NxN OCS is basically a massive train station with N tracks in and N tracks out. Any train coming in can be transferred to any train coming out, but this has to be reconfigured at the station. Trains cannot be “looped back” or sent back on another N track in, they must be routed only to one of the N tracks out. The benefit of this approach is that the network can assemble smaller logical TPU slices – for different workloads from the theoretical maximum of 9,216 chips in the ICI network layer. By rerouting ICI paths around faults in the network through slicing a larger cluster, cluster availability improves. Unlike Electronic Packet Switching (EPS) switches such as an Arista Tomahawk 5 where there is a fixed total bandwidth that is further split into several ports of smaller bandwidth sizes, OCSs allow any bandwidth of optical fiber to be connected to its ports. OCSs is also low latency compared to EPSs because optical signals entering an OCS simply bounce from the input port to the output port. For EPSs, optical signals must be converted to electrical signals when entering the switch – one key reason why an OCS is typically more power efficient than an EPS. An EPS also allows routing of packets from any port to any port, while an OCS only allows you to route an “in” port to any other “out” port only. OCS ports only route individual fiber strands. This becomes a challenge for standard duplex transceivers because bandwidth is transmitted over multiple fiber strands, which reduces the effective radix and bandwidth of the OCS. To solve this problem, an FR optical transceiver is used to consolidate all wavelengths onto a single fiber strand to be connected to 1 OCS port. The Apollo Project innovatively achieved this in two steps. First, the 8 wavelengths – 1 wavelength for each 100G lane – are multiplexed through Coarse Wave Division Multiplexing (CWDM8) to transmit 800G over a single fiber pair, instead of 8 fiber pairs. Second, an optical circulator is integrated on the wave division multiplexing (WDM) transceiver to enable full duplex data flow, reducing requirements from 1 fiber pair to only 1 fiber strand. The circulator forms a bi-directional link by combining the Tx and Rx fiber strands at the transceiver onto a single fiber strand that is sent to the OCS switch. Google’s ICI scale-up network is unique in that it allows the connection of multiple 64 TPU 4x4x4 Cubes together in a 3D torus configuration to create massive world sizes. The TPUv7 has a stated maximum world size of 9,216 TPUs but today, Google supports the configuration of TPUs into multiple different slice sizes of between 4 TPUs all the way up to 2,048 TPUs. While Google can innovatively achieve an impressive scale-up cluster of 9,216 TPUs, the benefit of running training workloads on incrementally larger block sizes of up to approximately 8,000 TPUs at any point in time decreases. This is because larger block sizes are more prone to failures and disruption, therefore decreasing slice availability, which is defined by the fraction of time in which the ICI cluster is able to form a contiguous 3D torus slice. For slices that can fit entirely within a 4x4x4 Cube, we can simply carve these slices out of that cube using the copper interconnects within the rack as well as the optical transceivers on the face/edge/corner of the cube to wrap around and complete the 3D Torus if needed.To see how wraparound and inter-cube connections are made, let’s start by looking at how we would create a 64 TPU slice in a 4x4x4 topography. We can use the unit 4x4x4 cube of 64 TPUs corresponding to one physical 64 TPU rack to build up this topography. All 8 TPUs in the interior of the 4x4x4 cube can fully connect to all 6 neighbors using copper. If a TPU does not have an interior neighbor along a given axis, it will wrap around and connect to a TPU on the opposite side of the cube. For example, TPU 4,1,4 has no interior neighbor in the Z+ direction, so it will use one 800G optical transceiver to connect to an OCS assigned to the Z-axis, with the OCS configured to direct this connection to the Z- side of the cube, connecting to TPU 4,1,1. In the Y- direction, TPU 1,1,1 will use an optical transceiver to connect to a Y-axis OCS to link to the Y+ side of TPU 1,4,1 and so on. Each face of the 4x4x4 cube will connect via 16 different OCSs – one OCS for each TPU on each face. For example, in the diagram below, on the X+ face, TPU 4,3,2 connects to the input side of OCS X,3,2. OCS X,3,2’s input side will also connect to the same TPU Index (4,3,2) on the X+ face of all 144 4x4x4 Cubes in the 9,216 TPU cluster. OCS X,3,2’s output side will then connect to the same TPU Index for every single cube in the cluster except this time on the X- face – so it will connect to TPU 1,3,2 on all 144 cubes of the cluster. The diagram below illustrates how all 16 TPUs on the X+ face of Cube A connect via 16 OCSs to 16 TPUs on the X- of Cube B. These connections allow any “+” face of any cube to connect to the “-“ face of any other cube, enabling complete fungibility of cubes when forming slices. There are two constraints to briefly point out. First, TPUs of one Index on a given face can never connect directly to a different index – so TPU 4,3,2 could never be configured to connect to TPU 1,2,3. Second, as the OCS essentially acts as a patch panel – TPUs connected on the input side cannot “loop back” to connect to any other TPU that is also connected on the input side of the OCS - as an example, TPU 4,3,2 can never connect to TPU 4,3,3. So – any TPU on the “+” face can never connect to the “+” face of any other cube, and any TPU on the “-” face can never connect to the “-” face of any other cube. Let’s go larger and see how a 4x4x8 Topography could be set up. In this configuration, we extend the slice by connecting two 64 TPU 4x4x4 cubes along the Z-axis. In this case, the OCS will reconfigure the optical port that TPU 4,1,4 is connected to so that it now connects to TPU 4,1,5 instead of wrapping around back to TPU 4,1,1 as was the case for a standalone 4x4x4 topography. Extending this, we will have 16 optical connections extending from the Z- and Z+ faces of each of the two 4x4x4 TPU cubes, for a total of 64 Fiber strands connected into 16 Z-Axis OCSs. It is important to remind readers that Cube A and Cube B depicted below are not necessarily physically located next to each other. Instead, they are connected via OCSs and they could each be in completely different locations in the datacenter. We will now move to a much larger topology – the 16x16x16 topology, which brings us up to 4,096 TPUs. In this topology, we use a total of 48 OCSs to connect 64 Cubes of 64 TPUs each. In the diagram below, each multi-colored cube represents one 64 TPU 4x4x4 cube. Taking the bottom right 4x4x4 cube as an example – this cube is connected to adjacent cubes along the Y-axis via OCSs. The maximum world size of 9,216 TPUs is built up using 144 4x4x4 cubes requiring 96 optical connections each amounting to a total requirement of 13,824 ports. Dividing this total port requirement by 288 (144 input and 144 output ports on each OCS) means we need 48 144x144 OCSs to support this maximum world size. But what is so great about Google’s unique ICI scale-up network – other than all the fancy cube diagrams one can spend countless hours drawing? World Size: The most obvious benefit is the very large 9,216 TPU maximum world size that the TPUv7 Ironwood supports. Even though the maximum slice size of 9,216 may rarely be used due to the drawback of diminished goodput, slices of thousands of TPUs can and are commonly used. This is far larger than the 64 or 72 GPU world size that is common in the merchant accelerator market and for other custom silicon providers. Reconfigurable and Fungibility: The use of OCSs mean that the network topology inherently supports the reconfiguration of network connections to support a high number of different topologies – in theory thousands of topologies. Google’s documentation site lists out 10 different combinations (image earlier in this section), but these are only the most common 3D slice shapes – there are many more available. Even slices of the same size can be reconfigured differently. In the simple example of a Twisted 2D Torus diagrammed below, we see how looping across to an index of a different X coordinate instead of an index of the same X coordinate can reduce the worst-case number of hops and the worst-case bisection bandwidth. This can help improve all to all collective throughput. A TPUv7 cluster will twist at the 4x4x4 cube level. Reconfigurability also opens the door to a broad diversity of parallelisms. In a 64 or 72 GPU world size, different parallelism combinations are generally limited to the factors of 64. When it comes to the ICI scale-up network, the possibilities for implementing topologies to precisely match the combination of data parallelism, tensor parallelism and pipeline parallelism desired are plentiful. The fact that OCSs allow one to connect any “+” face of any cube to the “-“ face of any other cube means that there is complete fungibility of cubes. Slices can be formed out of any set of cubes. So if there are any faults or change in user demands or usage, this will not obstruct the formation of new topology slices. Lower Cost: Google’s ICI network has a lower cost than most switched scale-up networks. Though the FR optics used can be slightly expensive due to the use of circulators, the mesh network reduces the overall number of switches and ports that are needed and eliminates cost arising from connections between switches. Low Latency and Better Locality: The use of direct links between TPUs means that it is possible to achieve much lower latency for TPUs that are physically located close to one another or are reconfigured to connect directly to each other. TPUs that are close to each other also have better data locality. The Datacenter Network (DCN) is a network separate to ICI that serves the role of both a typical backend and front-end network. It connects across an even larger domain – 147k TPUs in the case of TPUv7 clusters. As discussed in our earlier post on Mission Apollo, where Google proposed replacing the Electronic Packet Switch (EPS)-containing spine layer of the traditional “Clos” architecture with Paloma Optical Circuit Switches (OCS), Google’s DCN consists of an optically switched Datacenter Network Interconnect (DCNI) layer that combines several aggregation blocks, each of which connects several 9,216 TPU ICI clusters. In 2022, Google’s Apollo project proposed a DCN architecture that described using 136x136 OCS switches for TPUv4 pods with a pod size of 4,096 TPUs. OCS switches at the DCNI layer were organized into 4 Apollo zones, each containing a maximum of 8 racks of 8 OCS switches for a total of 256 OCS switches. When it comes to Ironwood, to support up to 147k TPUv7s on the same network, we hypothesize that the number of ports on the OCS will nearly double as opposed to increasing the maximum number of OCS switches.The diagram below illustrates what an Ironwood DCN network using 32 racks holding 256 300x300 OCS switches could look like. Assuming that there is no oversubscription between the spine layers of each aggregation block, a maximum of 16 ICI pods can be connected in the DCN with 4 aggregation blocks connecting 4 ICI pods each – a total of 147,456 TPUs. The DCNI layer connects the 4 aggregation blocks – depicted as the top layer in the diagram below. As with ICI, FR Optics are used to connect to the OCSs in order to maximize bandwidth per port on each OCS. While existing Ironwood clusters may only have 1 or 2 aggregation blocks, Google DCN’s unique architecture allows for new aggregation blocks of TPUs to be added to the network without significant rewiring. By using OCSs for the DCNI layer, the size of the DCN fabric can be incrementally expanded and the network can be re-striped to support new aggregation blocks. Furthermore, the bandwidth of aggregation blocks can be upgraded without having to change the make-up of the DCN layer. This allows the link speeds of existing aggregation blocks to be refreshed without changing the fundamental architecture of the network itself. The process of fabric expansion cannot go on indefinitely – at significant scale, it becomes unmanageable to rewire the network. Traditionally, TPU software and hardware teams have been internal-facing. This comes with advantages such as the absence of pressure by marketing teams to inflate stated theoretical FLOPs. Another advantage of being only internal facing is that the TPU teams heavily prioritized internal feature requests & optimizing internal workloads. The disadvantage is that they did not care much about external customers or workloads. The number of external developers in the TPU ecosystem is way lower than in the CUDA ecosystem. This is one of the main weaknesses of the TPU as it is with all non-Nvidia accelerators. Google has since revised their software strategy for externally-facing customers and has already made major changes to their TPU team’s KPIs and how they approach contributing to the AI/ML ecosystem. There are 2 major changes that we will discuss: Massive engineering effort on PyTorch TPU “native” support Massive engineering effort on vLLM/SGLang TPU support The externalization strategy is clear to see by looking at the number of contributions from various TPU software repos by Google. We can see a noticeable increase in vLLM contributions starting from March. Then from May, the “tpu-inference” repo was created which is the official vLLM TPU unified back-end, and since then there has been a flurry of activity. Traditionally, Google only had first class support on the Jax/XLA:TPU stack (and TensorFlow/TF-Mesh RIP), but treated PyTorch on TPU as second class citizen. It relied on lazy tensor graph capture through PyTorch/XLA instead of having a first-class eager execution mode. Furthermore, it did not support PyTorch native distributed APIs (torch.distributed.*) or support PyTorch native parallelism APIs (DTensor, FSDP2, DDP, etc), but relied on weird out of tree XLA SPMD APIs (torch_xla.experimental.spmd_fsdp, torch_xla.distributed.spmd, etc.). This has led to a subpar non-native experience for external users that are used to the native PyTorch CUDA backend on GPUs and trying to switch to TPUs. In October, Google’s “Captain Awesome” Robert Hundt quietly announced in the XLA repo that they will be moving away from a non-native lazy tensor backend towards a “native” TPU PyTorch backend that will support eager execution by default & integration with torch.compile & DTensor & torch.distributed APIs, etc. They will be doing this through the use of PrivateUse1 TorchDispatch key. This will mainly be done for Meta who has renewed interest in buying TPUs & does not want to move to JAX. It will also make it for people that enjoy PyTorch and do not like JAX to use TPUs too. Previously from 2020 to 2023, heavily used by a couple of teams at Meta FAIR used PyTorch XLA on TPUs but it was not widely adopted thus Meta leadership ended up cancelling the contracts in 2023. PyTorch XLA on TPUs is not a fun experience. The Meta FAIR GCP TPUs back then were even run using SLURM and not anything typical you would find on TPU stack like GKE/Xmanager/borg/etc. This new PyTorch <> TPU will create a smoother transition for ML scientists that are used to PyTorch on GPUs to switch to PyTorch on TPUs and take advantage of the higher performance per TCO on TPUs. Pallas is the kernel authoring language for writing custom kernels for TPU (similar to cuTile or Triton or CuTe-DSL). Meta & Google have also started work on supporting Pallas kernels as a codegen target for the Torch Dynamo/Inductor compile stack. This will allow for native TPU integration with PyTorch’s native torch.compile API & allow for end users to register custom pallas ops into PyTorch. In addition to the core in tree PyTorch native APIs, there is also work behind the scenes on integrating TPU pallas kernel language as a codegen target for Helion. You can think of Helion as a higher-level language for writing decently performing kernels in a high level language. Users can think about Helion as a low level Aten operators rather than as high level Triton/Pallas due to its similarity matching much closer to the Native PyTorch Aten ops. Another area where the CUDA ecosystem is supreme is for open ecosystem inference. Historically, vLLM & SGLang support CUDA as first class (as ROCm as 2nd class citizen). Now Google wants in to the vLLM & SGlang open inference ecosystem and have announced beta TPU v5p/v6e support for vLLM & SGLang through a very “unique” integration. vLLM& SGLang currently does this by lowering the PyTorch modelling code into JAX and taking advantage of the existing mature JAX TPU compilation flow. In the future once PyTorch XLA RFC #9684 (aka native TPU PyTorch backend) gets implemented, vLLM & SGLang plan on evaluating whether to switch to using that instead of translating modelling from PyTorch to JAX through TorchAX. Google & vLLM claim that this lowering to jax path does not require any changes to the PyTorch modelling code but given how few models vLLM TPU supports so far, we doubt this is true. Furthermore, Google has open-sourced & integrated some of their TPU kernels into vLLM such as a TPU optimized paged attention kernels, compute-comms overlapped GEMM kernels & a couple other quantized matmul kernels. They do not yet have MLA-friendly TPU kernels. It would be interesting to see once Inductor Pallas TPU codegen integration is more mature, whether it is possible to integrate kernel fusion & pattern matching into the existing vLLM PassManager. SGLang is also looking into implementing an torch.compile PassManager to make managing kernel fusions for many models more maintainable. For Ragged Paged Attention v3, TPU handles it quite differently from vLLM GPU. vLLM manages KV cache with a technique similar to virtual memory and paging. However, this technique requires fetching dynamic addresses and performing scatter operations, something TPUs don’t support well. As a result, TPU kernels leverage fine-grained operation pipelining. Specifically, TPU’s page attention kernel prefetches query and KV blocks for the next sequence, so the memory loading is overlapped with computation. In the existing vLLM MoE kernel, we sort tokens by expert ID, dispatch tokens to the devices with the corresponding experts, perform group matrix multiplication, and combine tokens from experts back to original devices. However, the kernel performs poorly for two reasons: TPUs are slow at performing sorting operations, and the kernel is unable to overlap communication with computation. To work around this issue, Google developers designed all-fused MoE. All-fused MoE dispatches tokens for one expert per device at a time while overlapping MoE dispatch & MoE combine communications & avoiding sorting tokens by expert ID. With all-fused MoE, the Google engineer reported 3 - 4x speedup over existing kernels. Furthermore, another hardware unit in TPUs is the SparseCore (SC) used to accelerate embedding lookups and updates. SC comes with a scalar subcore SparseCore Sequencer (SCS) and multiple vector subcores SparseCore Tiles (SCT). SCT supports local and remote direct memory access at a more fine-grained 4-byte or 32-byte granularity, compared to TPU TensorCore’s 512-byte loads. This enables SC to perform gather/scatter operations and ICI communications while overlapping with TensorCore operations. At JAX DevLabs, we learned that programmability of SparseCore is a work in progress. We can expect Mosaic, the TPU custom kernel compiler, to compile in an MPMD fashion, where SCS and SCT executes different kernels, and different SparseCores can run different programs. We suspect once the programmability catches up, TPU MoE kernels would be able to perform dispatch and combine operations in a similar way as GPUs, instead of dispatching by expert IDs. In terms of disaggregated prefill decode, which we described in depth in our AMD 2.0 post, Google has experimental support on vLLM for single host disagg PD, not they do not support multi-host wideEP disagg prefill or MTP yet. These inference optimizations are critical to lower the TCO per million tokens and increase the perf per dollar and perf per watt. Furthermore, they have not yet integrated TPU vLLM inference support into popular RL frameworks like VERL, etc. Google is slowly moving in the correct direction in terms of how they approach the open AI/ML ecosystem especially for their “native” TPU backend. This week, there was an new inference benchmark on TPUv6e that dropped claiming that TPUv6e has 5x worst performance per dollar than NVIDIA GPUs. We disagree mainly due to 2 reasons. First of all, this is benchmark is on vLLM on TPUs which was only released an couple month ago thus does not yet have optimized performance. Google internal Gemini workloads & Anthropic workloads work on an internal custom inference stack that has better perf per TCO than NVIDIA GPUs. Secondly, Aritifical Analysis’s cost per million tokens is using the list price of $2.7/hr/chip for TPUv6e. No major customers of TPUs is paying anywhere close to that much for TPUv6e given the BOM is a tiny fraction of the H100. As everyone knows, most clouds have an high ball list price such that their account sales executives can do “car salesman” tactics and give massive discounts so that the customer thinks they are getting a good deal. The SemiAnalysis AI TCO Model tracks the acutal market rental price of TPUs across all the various contract lengths (1 month, 1 year, 3 years, etc). One part where Google is still approaching their software strategy incorrectly is with their XLA graph compiler & networking libraries & TPU runtime is still not open sourced nor well documented. This has led to frustrated users across the spectrum from advanced users to the average user of not being able to debug what is going wrong with their code. Furthermore their MegaScale codebase for multi-pod training is not open source either. We strongly believe that in order to accelerate the adoption, Google should open source it and the increased user adoption will outweigh all the software IP they will make public & free. Just like how PyTorch or Linux being open sourced rapidly increased adoption, open sourcing XLA:TPU & TPU runtime & networking libs will rapidly accelerated this too. Now that Google has gotten their act together on TPU and is selling them externally for people to put in their own datacenters, what are the implications on Nvidia’s business? Does Nvidia finally have a legitimate competitor that will put its market share and margins at threat? Behind the paywall, we will share our thoughts on what this means for Nvidia as well as reveal more about the TPU roadmap.

The two best models in the world, Anthropic’s Claude 4.5 Opus and Google’s Gemini 3 have the majority of their training and inference infrastructure on Google’s TPUs and Amazon’s Trainium. Now Google is selling TPUs physically to multiple firms. Is this the end of Nvidia’s dominance? The dawn of the AI era is here, and it is crucial to understand that the cost structure of AI-driven software deviates considerably from traditional software. Chip microarchitecture and system architecture play a vital role in the development and scalability of these innovative new forms of software. The hardware infrastructure on which AI software runs has a notably larger impact on Capex and Opex, and subsequently the gross margins, in contrast to earlier generations of software, where developer costs were relatively larger. Consequently, it is even more crucial to devote considerable attention to optimizing your AI infrastructure to be able to deploy AI software. Firms that have an advantage in infrastructure will also have an advantage in the ability to deploy and scale applications with AI. Google had peddled the idea of building AI-specific infrastructure as far back as 2006, but the problem came to a boiling point in 2013. They realized they needed to double the number of datacenters they had if they wanted to deploy AI at any scale. As such, they started laying the groundwork for their TPU chips which were put into production in 2016. It’s interesting to compare this to Amazon, who in the same year, realized they needed to build custom silicon too. In 2013, they started the Nitro Program, which was focused on developing silicon to optimize general-purpose CPU computing and storage. Two very different companies optimized their efforts for infrastructure for different eras of computing and software paradigms. We’ve long believed that the TPU is among the world’s best systems for AI training and inference, neck and neck with king of the jungle Nvidia. 2.5 years ago we wrote about TPU supremacy, and this thesis has proven to be very correct. TPU’s results speak for themselves: Gemini 3 is one of the best models in the world and was trained entirely on TPUs. In this report, we will talk about the huge changes in Google’s strategy to properly commercialize the TPU for external customers, becoming the newest and most threatening merchant silicon challenger to Nvidia. We plan to: (Re-)Educate our clients and new readers about the rapidly growing commercial success of external TPU customers, starting with Anthropic and extending to Meta, SSI, xAI and even potentially OpenAI... Show that: The more (TPU) you buy, the more (NVIDIA GPU capex) you save! OpenAI hasn’t even deployed TPU yet and already increased perf per TCO by getting ~30% off their compute fleet due to competitive threats Explain the circular economy deals for AI Infrastructure. Revisit our original TPU deep dive with a refresher on the TPU hardware stack from silicon down to the software layer. Cover the positive developments on the open software ecosystem front as well as the critical missing ingredient for Google to make the TPU ecosystem a viable challenger to the CUDA moat: open source their XLA:TPU compiler, runtime, and multi-pod “MegaScaler” code. In the paywall, we will discuss the implications for Nvidia’s moat and compare Vera Rubin to the next gen TPUv8AX/8X (aka Sunfish/Zebrafish) Also cover the long term threat to Nvidia. First, let’s talk about the impact this news has had on the ecosystem. TPU performance has clearly caught the attention of its rivals. Sam Altman has acknowledged “rough vibes” ahead for OpenAI as Gemini has stolen the thunder from OpenAI. Nvidia even put out a reassuring PR telling everyone to keep calm and carry on — we are well ahead of the competition. We understand why. These past few months have been win after win for the Google Deepmind, GCP, and TPU complex. The huge upwards revisions to TPU production volumes, Anthropic’s >1GW TPU buildout, SOTA models Gemini 3 and Opus 4.5 trained on TPU, and now an expanding list of clients being targeted (Meta, SSI, xAI, OAI) lining up for TPUs. This has driven a huge re-rating of the Google and TPU supply chain at the expense of the Nvidia GPU-focused supply chain. While the “sudden” emergence of Google and the TPU supply chain has caught many by surprise, SemiAnalysis institutional product subscribers have been anticipating this for the last year. Another reason Nvidia has been on the defensive is a growing chorus of skeptics who argue the company is propping up a “circular economy” by funding cash-burning AI startups, essentially moving money from one pocket to another with extra steps. We think this view is misplaced, but it has clearly struck a nerve inside Nvidia. The finance team issued a detailed response, reproduced below. We think a more realistic explanation is that Nvidia aims to protect its dominant position at the foundation labs by offering equity investment rather than cutting prices, which would lower Gross margins and cause widespread investor panic. Below, we outline the OpenAI and Anthropic arrangements to show how frontier labs can lower GPU TCO by buying, or threatening to buy TPUs. OpenAI hasn’t even deployed TPUs yet and they’ve already saved ~30% on their entire lab wide NVIDIA fleet. This demonstrates how the perf per TCO advantage of TPUs is so strong that you already get the gains from adopting TPUs even before turning one on. Our Accelerator Industry Model, Datacenter Industry Model and Core Research subscribers saw the industry implications well before this was announced and became market consensus. In early August, we shared with our Accelerator Model clients that we saw massive upward revisions for Broadcom / Google TPU orders in the supply chain for 2026. We also revealed that the reason for these order increases was the fact that Google would begin selling systems externally to multiple customers. In early September, we revealed that one of the big external customers will be Anthropic, with demand of at least 1 million TPUs. This was officially confirmed by Anthropic and Google in October. We also called out Meta as a big TPU customer on the 7th of November, weeks before others. In addition we have discussed other customers as well. As a result, our institutional clients have had plenty of heads up on one of the largest performance dispersions in the AI Trade to date. SemiAnalysis was the first to break all these insights because no other research firm can connect the dots from the fabs to supply chain through the datacenters to the labs. To get access to these insights as and stay ahead of the curve: sales@semianalysis.com Onto the deal. The TPU stack has long rivaled Nvidia’s AI hardware, yet it has mostly supported Google’s internal workloads. In typical Google fashion, it never fully commercialized the TPU even after making it available to GCP customers in 2018. That is starting to change. Over the past few months, Google has mobilized efforts across the whole stack to bring TPUs to external customers through GCP or by selling complete TPU systems as a merchant vendor. The search giant is leveraging its strong in-house silicon design capabilities to become a truly differentiated cloud provider. Furthermore, it aligns with marquis customer Anthropic’s continued push to diversify away from its dependence on NVDA. The Anthropic deal marks a major milestone in this push. We understand that GCP CEO Thomas Kurian played a central role in the negotiations. Google committed early by investing aggressively in Anthropic’s funding rounds, even agreeing to no voting rights and a 15% cap on their ownership to expand the use of TPUs beyond internal Google. This strategy was eased by the presence of former DeepMind TPU talent within the foundation lab, resulting in Anthropic training Sonnet and Opus 4.5 on multiple types of hardware including TPUs. Google has already built a substantial facility for Anthropic, as shown below as part of our building-by-building tracker of AI labs. Beyond renting capacity in Google datacenters through GCP, Anthropic will deploy TPUs in its own facilities, positioning Google to compete directly with Nvidia as a true merchant hardware vendor. In terms of the split of the 1M TPUs: The first phase of the deal covers 400k TPUv7 Ironwoods, worth ~$10 billion in finished racks that Broadcom will sell directly to Anthropic. Anthropic is the fourth customer referenced in Broadcom’s most recent earnings call. Fluidstack, a gold-rated ClusterMax Neocloud provider, will handle on-site setup, cabling, burn-in, acceptance testing, and remote hands work as Anthropic offloads managing physical servers. DC infrastructure will be supplied by TeraWulf (WULF) and Cipher Mining (CIFR). The remaining 600k TPUv7 units will be rented through GCP in a deal we estimate at $42 billion of RPO, accounting for most of the $49 billion increase in GCP’s backlog reported in the third quarter. We believe additional deals with Meta, OAI, SSI, and xAI could provide additional RPO + direct hardware sales for GCP in coming quarters. Despite heavy internal and external demand, Google has not been able to deploy TPUs at the pace it wants. Even though it has more control over its hardware supply than other hyperscalers that still need curry favor with Jensen, Google’s main bottleneck is power. While other hyperscalers have expanded their own sites and secured significant colocation capacity, Google has moved more slowly. We believe the core issue is contractual and administrative. Each new datacenter vendor requires a Master Services Agreement, and these are multibillion-dollar, multiyear commitments that naturally involve some bureaucracy. Yet Google’s process is especially slow, often taking up to three years from initial discussions to a signed MSA. Google’s workaround carries major implications for Neocloud providers and cryptominers looking to pivot to AI DC infrastructure. Instead of leasing directly, Google offers a credit backstop, an off-balance-sheet “IOU” to step in if Fluidstack cannot pay its datacenter rent. Neoclouds like Fluidstack are nimble and flexible, making it easier for them to deal with new datacenter vendors like reformed cryptominers. This mechanic has been key to our bullish views on the cryptomining industry – notably we were calling out numerous including IREN and Applied Digital at the beginning of the year when stock prices were materially lower. The opportunity for miners rests on a simple dynamic: the datacenter industry faces acute power constraints power, and cryptominers already control capacity through their PPAs and existing electrical infrastructure. We expect many more agreements to follow in the coming weeks and quarters. Prior to the Google/Fluidstack/TeraWulf deal, we had not seen any deal with a mere off-balance-sheet “IOU” in the Neocloud market. After the deal, we believe it has become the new de-facto standard financing template. This solves a key headache for Neoclouds looking to secure datacenter capacity and grow their business: A GPU cluster has a useful and economic life of 4-5years A large datacenter lease is typically 15+ years, with a typical payback period of ~8 years. This duration mismatch has made it very complicated for both Neoclouds and Datacenter vendors to secure financing for projects. But with the rise of the “hyperscaler backstop”, we believe the financing issues are solved. We expect a new wave of growth for the NeoCloud industry. Check out our Accelerator and Datacenter models to understand the key beneficiaries. These are the how’s and why’s behind the Anthropic deal, now let’s get into the hardware. Furthermore, Neoclouds who count Jensen as an investor such as CoreWeave, Nebius, Crusoe, Together, Lambda, Firmus, and Nscale all have a notable incentive to not adopt any competing technology in their datacenter: TPUs, AMD GPUs, or even Arista switches are off limits! This leaves a gaping hole in the market for TPU hosting that is currently filled by a combination of crypto miners + Fluidstack. In the coming months, we expect to see more Neoclouds make the tough decision between pursuing a growing TPU hosting opportunity and securing allocations of the latest and greatest Nvidia Rubin systems. The answer is simple. It is a strong chip inside an excellent system, and that combination offers compelling performance and TCO for Anthropic. 2.5 years ago, we wrote about Google’s compute infrastructure advantage. Even with silicon that lagged Nvidia’s on paper, Google’s system-level engineering allowed the TPU stack to match Nvidia in both performance and cost efficiency. We argued then that “systems matter more than microarchitecture,” and the past two years have reinforced that view. Anthropic’s massive TPU orders are a direct validation of the platform’s technical strength. The GPU ecosystem has shifted forward as well. Nvidia’s GB200 represents a major leap forward, pushing Nvidia toward becoming a true systems company that designs full servers rather than only the chip package inside. While we are on the topic of the GB200’s huge innovation in rack-scale interconnect, one underappreciated point is that Google has been scaling up TPUs within and across racks since TPU v2 back in 2017! Further down in the report, we feature a deep dive on Google’s ICI scale-up networking, the only real rival to Nvidia’s NVLink. Google’s recent Gemini 3 model is now viewed as the state of the art frontier LLM. Like all earlier versions of Gemini, it was trained entirely on TPUs. That result offers concrete proof of both TPU capability and Google’s broader infrastructure advantage. Today’s attention often centers on hardware for inference and post-training, yet pre-training a frontier model remains the hardest and most resource-intensive challenge in AI hardware. The TPU platform has passed that test decisively. This stands in sharp contrast to rivals: OpenAI’s leading researchers have not completed a successful full-scale pre-training run that was broadly deployed for a new frontier model since GPT-4o in May 2024, highlighting the significant technical hurdle that Google’s TPU fleet has managed to overcome. One of the key highlights of the new model include noticeable gains in tool calling and agentic capability, especially on longer-horizon tasks for economically valuable tasks. Vending Bench is an evaluation that aims to measure how well models would run a business over a long period of time by placing them as the owner of a simulated vending machine business and Gemini 3 destroyed the competition. This launch brought not just improved capabilities but new products. Antigravity, a product born from the acqui-hire of former Windsurf CEO Varun Mohan and team, is Google’s answer to OpenAI’s Codex, officially entering Gemini into the vibe coding token guzzling wars. For Google to quietly muscle in and establish a performance lead in one of the most challenging hardware problems is a truly impressive feat for a company whose core business isn’t, or should we say, wasn’t in hardware business. The corollary to “Systems matter more than Microarchitecture”, is that while Google has been pushing the boundary on system and networking design, TPU silicon itself wasn’t too ground-breaking. Since then, TPU silicon has made massive strides with the latest generations. From the outset, Google’s design philosophy has been more conservative on silicon relative to Nvidia. Historically, TPUs have shipped with significantly fewer peak theoretical FLOPs, and lower memory specs than corresponding Nvidia GPUs. There are 3 reasons for this. First, Google places a high internal emphasis on ‘RAS’ (Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability) for their infrastructure. Google prefers to sacrifice absolute performance in exchange for greater hardware uptime. Running things to the limit means higher instances of hardware mortality which has a real TCO impact in terms of system downtime and hot spares. After all, the hardware you cannot use has infinite TCO relative to performance. The second reason is that up until 2023, Google’s primary AI workload was recommendation system models to power their core Search and Ad properties. RecSys workloads carry much lower arithmetic intensity compared to LLM workloads which means fewer FLOPs are required relative to every bit of data that is transferred. The third comes down to the utility of “peak theoretical FLOPs” numbers that are marketed and how they can be manipulated. Merchant GPU providers like Nvidia and AMD want to market the best performance specifications possible for their chips. This incentivizes them to stretch marketed FLOPs to the highest number possible. In practice, these numbers are unable to be sustained. On the other hand, the TPU has primarily been internal facing, with much less pressure to inflate these specifications externally. This has important implications that we’ll discuss further. The generous way to look at it would be Nvidia is better at DVFS therefore happy to report peak specs only. After we ushered in the LLM era, there has been a clear shift in Google’s TPU design philosophy. We can see that with the 2 most recent TPU generations that were designed-post LLM: TPUv6 Trillium (Ghostlite) and TPUv7 Ironwood (Ghostfish) reflect that change. We can see in the chart below that for TPUv4 and v5, compute throughput was much lower than the Nvidia flagship at the time. TPUv6 came very close to the H100/H200 on FLOPs, but it came 2 years later than the H100. With TPU v7, the gap narrows further with servers available only a few quarters later, while delivering almost the same level of peak theoretical FLOPs. What drove these performance gains? Partially it’s that Google started announcing TPUs as they ramp into production rather then after the next generation was being deployed. Furthermore, TPU v6 Trillium is manufactured on the same N5 node as TPU v5p with similar silicon area but was able to deliver a whopping 2x increase in peak theoretical FLOPs with significantly less power! For Trillium, Google quadrupled the size of each systolic array to 256 x 256 tiles from 128 x 128, and this increase in array size is what has delivered the increase in compute. Trillium was also the last of the “E” (lite) SKUs which meant it was equipped with only 2 sites of HBM3. While Trillium closed the gap to Hopper on compute, it fell far short of the H100/H200 on memory capacity and bandwidth, with only 2 stacks of HBM3 vs 5 and 6 stacks of HBM3 and HBM3E respectively. This made it painful to use for novices, but the performance TCO achieved for Trillium is unbeatable if you get shard your model properly and utilize all those cheap FLOPS. TPU v7 Ironwood is the next iteration where Google nearly completely closes the gap to the corresponding Nvidia flagship GPU on FLOPs, memory, and bandwidth albeit with general availability 1 year later than Blackwell. Compared to the GB200, FLOPs and memory bandwidth only have a slight shortfall, with capacity being the same with 8-Hi HBM3E, which is of course a significant shortfall to GB300 which has 288GB of 12-Hi HBM3E. Theoretical absolute performance is one thing but what matters is real world performance per Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). While Google procures TPUs through Broadcom and pays a hefty margin, it is significantly less than the margin Nvidia earns on not only the GPUs they sell but entire the whole system including CPUs, Switches, NICs, system memory, cabling and connectors. From Google’s perspective this results in the all-in TCO per Ironwood chip for the full 3D Torus configuration being ~44% lower than the TCO of a GB200 server. This more than makes up for the ~10% shortfall on peak FLOPs and peak memory bandwidth. This is from the perspective of Google and the price they procure TPU servers at. What about Google’s external customers when Google adds their margin on top? We assume that in the case where Google earns a margin on leasing TPU 7 to external customers that the TCO per hour can still be up to ~30% lower than the cost of the GB200 and ~41% lower than the cost of the GB300. This is what we believe is reflective of Anthropic’s pricing via GCP. Comparing theoretical FLOPs tells only part of the story. What matters is effective FLOPs, since peak numbers are almost never reached in real-world workloads. In practice, Nvidia GPUs typically achieve only about a small portion of their theoretical peak once communication overhead, memory stalls, power limits, and other system effects are factored in. A good rule of thumb for training is 30%, but utilization also varies heavily by workload. A large share of the gap comes down to software and compiler efficiency. Nvidia’s advantage here stems from the CUDA moat and the wide set of open source libraries that come out of the box, helping workloads run efficiently with high realized FLOPs and memory bandwidth. The TPU software stack is not as easy to use, though this is beginning to change. Inside Google, TPUs benefit from excellent internal tooling that is not exposed to external customers, which makes out of the box performance weaker. However, this only applies to small and/or lazy users, and Anthropic is neither of those. Anthropic has strong engineering resources and ex-Google compiler experts who know both the TPU stack and understand their own model architecture well. They can invest in custom kernels to drive high TPU efficiency. As a result, they can reach substantially higher MFU and much better $/PFLOP performance. We believe that despite lower marketed peak FLOPs, TPUs can reach higher realized Model FLOP Utilization (MFU) than Blackwell, which translates into higher effective FLOPs for Ironwood. A major reason is that marketed GPU FLOPs from Nvidia and AMD are significantly inflated. Even in tests designed to maximize throughput through GEMMs shaped far from real workloads, Hopper only reached about ~80% of peak, Blackwell landed in the 70s, and AMD’s MI300 series in the 50s-60s. The limiting factor is power delivery. These chips cannot sustain the clock speeds used in the peak math. Nvidia and AMD implement Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling which means that the chip’s clock frequency is dynamically adjusted based on power consumption and thermals rather than a stable clock frequency that can actually be sustained. Nvidia and AMD then select the highest clock frequency that could possibly be delivered, even if very intermittently, to be used in the calculation of peak theoretical FLOPs (operations per cycle per ALU x number of ALUs x cycles per second i.e. clock frequency). There are other tricks that are employed, like running GEMMs on tensors filled with zeroes, as 0x0=0, the transistors don’t need to switch state from 0 to 1, therefore reducing the power draw of each operation. Of course, in the real world, zero-filled tensors are not multiplied together. When we put together much lower TCO and higher effective FLOPs utilization, from the perspective of Google the $ per effective FLOP becomes much cheaper, with ~15% MFU being the breakeven with GB300 at 30% MFU. This means if Google (or Anthropic) manages to hit half the FLOPs utilization of GB300, they still come out even. Of course, with Google’s elite compiler engineer team and deep understanding of their own models, the MFU they can realize on TPUs could be 40% potentially. That would be a whopping ~62% reduction in cost per effective training FLOP! However, when looking at the 600K rented TPUs, when we incorporate the higher TCO that Anthropic pays (ie inclusive of Google’s margin stacking) into this analysis, we estimate the cost to Anthropic to be $1.60 per TPU-hour from GCP, narrowing the TCO advantage. We believe that Anthropic can realize 40% MFU on TPUs due to both their focus on performance optimization as well as the TPU’s marketed FLOPs inherently being more realistic. This provides Anthropic with a staggering ~52% lower TCO per effective PFLOP compared to GB300 NVL72. The equilibrium where TCO per effective FLOP compared to the GB300 baseline is the same is at a much lower 19% extracted MFU for Anthropic. This means that Anthropic can suffer a sizeable performance shortfall relative to the baseline GB300 and the perf/TCO for training FLOPs still ends up being the same as the baseline Nvidia system. FLOPs are not the end all and be all for performance, memory bandwidth is super important for inference, especially on the bandwidth intensive decode step. It should be no surprise that $ per memory bandwidth for the TPU also ends up being much cheaper than GB300. There is significant evidence that at small message sizes such as 16MB to 64MB (loading an expert of a single layer), TPU’s even achieve higher memory bandwidth utilization then GPUs. All of this translates into more efficient compute to train and serve a model. Anthropic’s release of Opus 4.5 continued the usual focus on coding, setting a new SWE-Bench record. The main surprise was a ~67% price cut on the API. This price cut paired with the lower verbosity and higher token efficiency of the model compared to Sonnet (76% fewer tokens to match Sonnet’s best score, and 45% fewer to exceed it by 4 points) means Opus 4.5 is the best model for coding use cases and could effectively raise Anthropic’s realized token pricing as Sonnet is over 90% of token mix today. When it comes to pricing for external customers, Google needs to thread the needle to balance their own profitability whilst offering customers a competitive proposition. Our estimate for Anthropic pricing is on the lower end of ranges we’ve heard for external pricing. For a flagship customer such as Anthropic, who will provide valuable input into both the software and hardware roadmap whilst ordering a huge amount of volumes, we’d expect sweetheart pricing. While Nvidia’s eye-watering 4x markup (~75% gross margin) offers a lot of room for pricing flexibility, a good amount of oxygen is sucked away by Broadcom. Broadcom, as the TPU’s co-designer, earns a high margin on the silicon which is the largest component of system BOM. Still, this leaves a lot of room for Google to earn very good acceptable margins. We can see this from comparing the GCP Anthropic deal to other large GPU-based cloud deals. Note that this is looking at the 600k TPUs that is being rented with the remaining 400k TPU v7 chips being bought upfront by Anthropic. Under these assumptions, the TPU v7 economics show superior EBIT margins than the other large GPU-based cloud deals we have observed, with only OCI-OpenAI coming close. Even with Broadcom’s margin stack on the chip-level BOM, Google can still eke out far superior margins and returns than much more commoditized GPU deals. This is where the TPU stack allows GCP to be a truly differentiated CSP. Meanwhile someone like Microsoft Azure, whose ASIC program is struggling, is confined to earning more mediocre returns in the mere business of leasing merchant hardware. We’ve so far discussed how TPUs compare to Nvidia GPUs, focusing on per chip specs and the shortcomings. Now, let’s get back to the system discussion which is where TPU’s capabilities really start to diverge. One of the most distinctive features of the TPU is its extremely large scale up world size through the ICI protocol. The world size of a TPU pod reaches 9216 Ironwood TPUs, with large pod sizes being a feature of TPUs as early as TPUv2 back in 2017 scaling up to a full 256 1024-chip cluster size. Let’s start at the rack level, the basic building block of each TPU superpod. The TPU rack has a similar design over the last couple of generations. Each rack consists of 16 TPU Trays, 16 or 8 Host CPU Trays depending on the cooling configuration, a ToR Switch, power supply units, and BBUs. Each TPU tray consists of 1 TPU board with 4 TPU chip packages mounted. Each Ironwood TPU will have 4 OSFP cages for ICI connections and 1 CDFP PCIe cage for the connection to the Host CPU. Google has been implementing liquid cooled TPU racks since TPU v3 in 2018, but there are still some TPU generations in between that were designed to be air-cooled. The main difference between the liquid cooled and the air-cooled rack is that the air-cooled rack has 2 TPU trays to 1 host CPU tray ratio while the liquid cooled rack has a 1 to 1 ratio instead. An innovative design of TPU’s liquid cooling is that the flow rate of the coolant is actively controlled by the valves. This enables much more efficient cooling as the flow can be adjusted depending on the amount of workload that each chip has at any given time. Google’s TPU has also long adopted vertical power delivery, in which the VRM modules of the TPUs are on the other side of the PCB board. These VRM modules also require a cold plate for cooling. Overall, the TPU rack design is much simpler than that of the Nvidia Oberon NVL72 design, which has a much higher density and utilizes a backplane to connect GPUs to scale up switches. The scale up connections between the TPU trays are all over external copper cables or optics, which will be explained in the ICI section below. The connection between the TPU tray and the CPU tray is also over PCIe DAC cable. The building block of Google’s ICI scale-up network for TPUv7 is a 4x4x4 3D torus consisting of 64 TPUs. Each 4x4x4 cube of 64 TPUs maps to one physical rack of 64 TPUs. This is an ideal dimension as all 64 TPUs can be connected electrically to each other and still fit in a physical rack. The TPUs are connected to each other in a 3D torus configuration, with each TPU connecting to 6 neighbors total – 2 logically adjacent neighboring TPUs for each of the X, Y and Z axes. Each TPU is always connected to 2 other TPUs via PCB traces within the compute tray but depending on where the TPU is located within the 4x4x4 cube, it will connect to 4 other neighbors either via Direct Attach Copper (DAC) cables or via an Optical Transceiver. Connections within the interior of the 4x4x4 cube happen over copper, while connections outside of the 4x4x4 cube (including wrap-around connections back to the other side of the cube as well as connections to neighboring 4x4x4 cubes) will use optical transceivers and OCSs. In the below diagram, we see that as this is a 3D Torus network: TPU 2,3,4 (on the Z+ face) has a wraparound connection back to the opposite Z-axis face to TPU 2,3,1 (on the Z- face) using an 800G optical transceiver and routing through an OCS. As mentioned above, in addition to the 2 neighboring TPUs that are always connected via PCB traces, TPUs will connect to 4 other neighbors using DACs, transceivers or a mix of both depending on where in the 4x4x4 cube they are. TPUs in the interior of the 4x4x4 cube will connect to the 4 other neighbors exclusively using DACs, TPUs on the face of the cube will connect via 3 DACs and 1 optical transceiver, TPUs on the edge of the cube will connect via 2 optical transceivers and 2 DACs, while TPUs on the corners will connect via 1 DAC and 3 optical transceivers. You can remember how many transceivers a given TPU will use by looking at how many of the TPU’s sides are facing the “outside” of the cube. The diagram above, as well as the table below, summarizes the number of respective location types for TPUs and can be used to derive the attach ratio of 1.5 Optical Transceivers per TPU v7. These transceivers connect to Optical Circuit Switches (OCSs) which enable connections between 4x4x4 cubes – more on that in the next section. Google adopts a software-defined networking approach to manage network routes through Optical Circuit Switches (OCSs). An NxN OCS is basically a massive train station with N tracks in and N tracks out. Any train coming in can be transferred to any train coming out, but this has to be reconfigured at the station. Trains cannot be “looped back” or sent back on another N track in, they must be routed only to one of the N tracks out. The benefit of this approach is that the network can assemble smaller logical TPU slices – for different workloads from the theoretical maximum of 9,216 chips in the ICI network layer. By rerouting ICI paths around faults in the network through slicing a larger cluster, cluster availability improves. Unlike Electronic Packet Switching (EPS) switches such as an Arista Tomahawk 5 where there is a fixed total bandwidth that is further split into several ports of smaller bandwidth sizes, OCSs allow any bandwidth of optical fiber to be connected to its ports. OCSs is also low latency compared to EPSs because optical signals entering an OCS simply bounce from the input port to the output port. For EPSs, optical signals must be converted to electrical signals when entering the switch – one key reason why an OCS is typically more power efficient than an EPS. An EPS also allows routing of packets from any port to any port, while an OCS only allows you to route an “in” port to any other “out” port only. OCS ports only route individual fiber strands. This becomes a challenge for standard duplex transceivers because bandwidth is transmitted over multiple fiber strands, which reduces the effective radix and bandwidth of the OCS. To solve this problem, an FR optical transceiver is used to consolidate all wavelengths onto a single fiber strand to be connected to 1 OCS port. The Apollo Project innovatively achieved this in two steps. First, the 8 wavelengths – 1 wavelength for each 100G lane – are multiplexed through Coarse Wave Division Multiplexing (CWDM8) to transmit 800G over a single fiber pair, instead of 8 fiber pairs. Second, an optical circulator is integrated on the wave division multiplexing (WDM) transceiver to enable full duplex data flow, reducing requirements from 1 fiber pair to only 1 fiber strand. The circulator forms a bi-directional link by combining the Tx and Rx fiber strands at the transceiver onto a single fiber strand that is sent to the OCS switch. Google’s ICI scale-up network is unique in that it allows the connection of multiple 64 TPU 4x4x4 Cubes together in a 3D torus configuration to create massive world sizes. The TPUv7 has a stated maximum world size of 9,216 TPUs but today, Google supports the configuration of TPUs into multiple different slice sizes of between 4 TPUs all the way up to 2,048 TPUs. While Google can innovatively achieve an impressive scale-up cluster of 9,216 TPUs, the benefit of running training workloads on incrementally larger block sizes of up to approximately 8,000 TPUs at any point in time decreases. This is because larger block sizes are more prone to failures and disruption, therefore decreasing slice availability, which is defined by the fraction of time in which the ICI cluster is able to form a contiguous 3D torus slice. For slices that can fit entirely within a 4x4x4 Cube, we can simply carve these slices out of that cube using the copper interconnects within the rack as well as the optical transceivers on the face/edge/corner of the cube to wrap around and complete the 3D Torus if needed.To see how wraparound and inter-cube connections are made, let’s start by looking at how we would create a 64 TPU slice in a 4x4x4 topography. We can use the unit 4x4x4 cube of 64 TPUs corresponding to one physical 64 TPU rack to build up this topography. All 8 TPUs in the interior of the 4x4x4 cube can fully connect to all 6 neighbors using copper. If a TPU does not have an interior neighbor along a given axis, it will wrap around and connect to a TPU on the opposite side of the cube. For example, TPU 4,1,4 has no interior neighbor in the Z+ direction, so it will use one 800G optical transceiver to connect to an OCS assigned to the Z-axis, with the OCS configured to direct this connection to the Z- side of the cube, connecting to TPU 4,1,1. In the Y- direction, TPU 1,1,1 will use an optical transceiver to connect to a Y-axis OCS to link to the Y+ side of TPU 1,4,1 and so on. Each face of the 4x4x4 cube will connect via 16 different OCSs – one OCS for each TPU on each face. For example, in the diagram below, on the X+ face, TPU 4,3,2 connects to the input side of OCS X,3,2. OCS X,3,2’s input side will also connect to the same TPU Index (4,3,2) on the X+ face of all 144 4x4x4 Cubes in the 9,216 TPU cluster. OCS X,3,2’s output side will then connect to the same TPU Index for every single cube in the cluster except this time on the X- face – so it will connect to TPU 1,3,2 on all 144 cubes of the cluster. The diagram below illustrates how all 16 TPUs on the X+ face of Cube A connect via 16 OCSs to 16 TPUs on the X- of Cube B. These connections allow any “+” face of any cube to connect to the “-“ face of any other cube, enabling complete fungibility of cubes when forming slices. There are two constraints to briefly point out. First, TPUs of one Index on a given face can never connect directly to a different index – so TPU 4,3,2 could never be configured to connect to TPU 1,2,3. Second, as the OCS essentially acts as a patch panel – TPUs connected on the input side cannot “loop back” to connect to any other TPU that is also connected on the input side of the OCS - as an example, TPU 4,3,2 can never connect to TPU 4,3,3. So – any TPU on the “+” face can never connect to the “+” face of any other cube, and any TPU on the “-” face can never connect to the “-” face of any other cube. Let’s go larger and see how a 4x4x8 Topography could be set up. In this configuration, we extend the slice by connecting two 64 TPU 4x4x4 cubes along the Z-axis. In this case, the OCS will reconfigure the optical port that TPU 4,1,4 is connected to so that it now connects to TPU 4,1,5 instead of wrapping around back to TPU 4,1,1 as was the case for a standalone 4x4x4 topography. Extending this, we will have 16 optical connections extending from the Z- and Z+ faces of each of the two 4x4x4 TPU cubes, for a total of 64 Fiber strands connected into 16 Z-Axis OCSs. It is important to remind readers that Cube A and Cube B depicted below are not necessarily physically located next to each other. Instead, they are connected via OCSs and they could each be in completely different locations in the datacenter. We will now move to a much larger topology – the 16x16x16 topology, which brings us up to 4,096 TPUs. In this topology, we use a total of 48 OCSs to connect 64 Cubes of 64 TPUs each. In the diagram below, each multi-colored cube represents one 64 TPU 4x4x4 cube. Taking the bottom right 4x4x4 cube as an example – this cube is connected to adjacent cubes along the Y-axis via OCSs. The maximum world size of 9,216 TPUs is built up using 144 4x4x4 cubes requiring 96 optical connections each amounting to a total requirement of 13,824 ports. Dividing this total port requirement by 288 (144 input and 144 output ports on each OCS) means we need 48 144x144 OCSs to support this maximum world size. But what is so great about Google’s unique ICI scale-up network – other than all the fancy cube diagrams one can spend countless hours drawing? World Size: The most obvious benefit is the very large 9,216 TPU maximum world size that the TPUv7 Ironwood supports. Even though the maximum slice size of 9,216 may rarely be used due to the drawback of diminished goodput, slices of thousands of TPUs can and are commonly used. This is far larger than the 64 or 72 GPU world size that is common in the merchant accelerator market and for other custom silicon providers. Reconfigurable and Fungibility: The use of OCSs mean that the network topology inherently supports the reconfiguration of network connections to support a high number of different topologies – in theory thousands of topologies. Google’s documentation site lists out 10 different combinations (image earlier in this section), but these are only the most common 3D slice shapes – there are many more available. Even slices of the same size can be reconfigured differently. In the simple example of a Twisted 2D Torus diagrammed below, we see how looping across to an index of a different X coordinate instead of an index of the same X coordinate can reduce the worst-case number of hops and the worst-case bisection bandwidth. This can help improve all to all collective throughput. A TPUv7 cluster will twist at the 4x4x4 cube level. Reconfigurability also opens the door to a broad diversity of parallelisms. In a 64 or 72 GPU world size, different parallelism combinations are generally limited to the factors of 64. When it comes to the ICI scale-up network, the possibilities for implementing topologies to precisely match the combination of data parallelism, tensor parallelism and pipeline parallelism desired are plentiful. The fact that OCSs allow one to connect any “+” face of any cube to the “-“ face of any other cube means that there is complete fungibility of cubes. Slices can be formed out of any set of cubes. So if there are any faults or change in user demands or usage, this will not obstruct the formation of new topology slices. Lower Cost: Google’s ICI network has a lower cost than most switched scale-up networks. Though the FR optics used can be slightly expensive due to the use of circulators, the mesh network reduces the overall number of switches and ports that are needed and eliminates cost arising from connections between switches. Low Latency and Better Locality: The use of direct links between TPUs means that it is possible to achieve much lower latency for TPUs that are physically located close to one another or are reconfigured to connect directly to each other. TPUs that are close to each other also have better data locality. The Datacenter Network (DCN) is a network separate to ICI that serves the role of both a typical backend and front-end network. It connects across an even larger domain – 147k TPUs in the case of TPUv7 clusters. As discussed in our earlier post on Mission Apollo, where Google proposed replacing the Electronic Packet Switch (EPS)-containing spine layer of the traditional “Clos” architecture with Paloma Optical Circuit Switches (OCS), Google’s DCN consists of an optically switched Datacenter Network Interconnect (DCNI) layer that combines several aggregation blocks, each of which connects several 9,216 TPU ICI clusters. In 2022, Google’s Apollo project proposed a DCN architecture that described using 136x136 OCS switches for TPUv4 pods with a pod size of 4,096 TPUs. OCS switches at the DCNI layer were organized into 4 Apollo zones, each containing a maximum of 8 racks of 8 OCS switches for a total of 256 OCS switches. When it comes to Ironwood, to support up to 147k TPUv7s on the same network, we hypothesize that the number of ports on the OCS will nearly double as opposed to increasing the maximum number of OCS switches.The diagram below illustrates what an Ironwood DCN network using 32 racks holding 256 300x300 OCS switches could look like. Assuming that there is no oversubscription between the spine layers of each aggregation block, a maximum of 16 ICI pods can be connected in the DCN with 4 aggregation blocks connecting 4 ICI pods each – a total of 147,456 TPUs. The DCNI layer connects the 4 aggregation blocks – depicted as the top layer in the diagram below. As with ICI, FR Optics are used to connect to the OCSs in order to maximize bandwidth per port on each OCS. While existing Ironwood clusters may only have 1 or 2 aggregation blocks, Google DCN’s unique architecture allows for new aggregation blocks of TPUs to be added to the network without significant rewiring. By using OCSs for the DCNI layer, the size of the DCN fabric can be incrementally expanded and the network can be re-striped to support new aggregation blocks. Furthermore, the bandwidth of aggregation blocks can be upgraded without having to change the make-up of the DCN layer. This allows the link speeds of existing aggregation blocks to be refreshed without changing the fundamental architecture of the network itself. The process of fabric expansion cannot go on indefinitely – at significant scale, it becomes unmanageable to rewire the network. Traditionally, TPU software and hardware teams have been internal-facing. This comes with advantages such as the absence of pressure by marketing teams to inflate stated theoretical FLOPs. Another advantage of being only internal facing is that the TPU teams heavily prioritized internal feature requests & optimizing internal workloads. The disadvantage is that they did not care much about external customers or workloads. The number of external developers in the TPU ecosystem is way lower than in the CUDA ecosystem. This is one of the main weaknesses of the TPU as it is with all non-Nvidia accelerators. Google has since revised their software strategy for externally-facing customers and has already made major changes to their TPU team’s KPIs and how they approach contributing to the AI/ML ecosystem. There are 2 major changes that we will discuss: Massive engineering effort on PyTorch TPU “native” support Massive engineering effort on vLLM/SGLang TPU support The externalization strategy is clear to see by looking at the number of contributions from various TPU software repos by Google. We can see a noticeable increase in vLLM contributions starting from March. Then from May, the “tpu-inference” repo was created which is the official vLLM TPU unified back-end, and since then there has been a flurry of activity. Traditionally, Google only had first class support on the Jax/XLA:TPU stack (and TensorFlow/TF-Mesh RIP), but treated PyTorch on TPU as second class citizen. It relied on lazy tensor graph capture through PyTorch/XLA instead of having a first-class eager execution mode. Furthermore, it did not support PyTorch native distributed APIs (torch.distributed.*) or support PyTorch native parallelism APIs (DTensor, FSDP2, DDP, etc), but relied on weird out of tree XLA SPMD APIs (torch_xla.experimental.spmd_fsdp, torch_xla.distributed.spmd, etc.). This has led to a subpar non-native experience for external users that are used to the native PyTorch CUDA backend on GPUs and trying to switch to TPUs. In October, Google’s “Captain Awesome” Robert Hundt quietly announced in the XLA repo that they will be moving away from a non-native lazy tensor backend towards a “native” TPU PyTorch backend that will support eager execution by default & integration with torch.compile & DTensor & torch.distributed APIs, etc. They will be doing this through the use of PrivateUse1 TorchDispatch key. This will mainly be done for Meta who has renewed interest in buying TPUs & does not want to move to JAX. It will also make it for people that enjoy PyTorch and do not like JAX to use TPUs too. Previously from 2020 to 2023, heavily used by a couple of teams at Meta FAIR used PyTorch XLA on TPUs but it was not widely adopted thus Meta leadership ended up cancelling the contracts in 2023. PyTorch XLA on TPUs is not a fun experience. The Meta FAIR GCP TPUs back then were even run using SLURM and not anything typical you would find on TPU stack like GKE/Xmanager/borg/etc. This new PyTorch <> TPU will create a smoother transition for ML scientists that are used to PyTorch on GPUs to switch to PyTorch on TPUs and take advantage of the higher performance per TCO on TPUs. Pallas is the kernel authoring language for writing custom kernels for TPU (similar to cuTile or Triton or CuTe-DSL). Meta & Google have also started work on supporting Pallas kernels as a codegen target for the Torch Dynamo/Inductor compile stack. This will allow for native TPU integration with PyTorch’s native torch.compile API & allow for end users to register custom pallas ops into PyTorch. In addition to the core in tree PyTorch native APIs, there is also work behind the scenes on integrating TPU pallas kernel language as a codegen target for Helion. You can think of Helion as a higher-level language for writing decently performing kernels in a high level language. Users can think about Helion as a low level Aten operators rather than as high level Triton/Pallas due to its similarity matching much closer to the Native PyTorch Aten ops. Another area where the CUDA ecosystem is supreme is for open ecosystem inference. Historically, vLLM & SGLang support CUDA as first class (as ROCm as 2nd class citizen). Now Google wants in to the vLLM & SGlang open inference ecosystem and have announced beta TPU v5p/v6e support for vLLM & SGLang through a very “unique” integration. vLLM& SGLang currently does this by lowering the PyTorch modelling code into JAX and taking advantage of the existing mature JAX TPU compilation flow. In the future once PyTorch XLA RFC #9684 (aka native TPU PyTorch backend) gets implemented, vLLM & SGLang plan on evaluating whether to switch to using that instead of translating modelling from PyTorch to JAX through TorchAX. Google & vLLM claim that this lowering to jax path does not require any changes to the PyTorch modelling code but given how few models vLLM TPU supports so far, we doubt this is true. Furthermore, Google has open-sourced & integrated some of their TPU kernels into vLLM such as a TPU optimized paged attention kernels, compute-comms overlapped GEMM kernels & a couple other quantized matmul kernels. They do not yet have MLA-friendly TPU kernels. It would be interesting to see once Inductor Pallas TPU codegen integration is more mature, whether it is possible to integrate kernel fusion & pattern matching into the existing vLLM PassManager. SGLang is also looking into implementing an torch.compile PassManager to make managing kernel fusions for many models more maintainable. For Ragged Paged Attention v3, TPU handles it quite differently from vLLM GPU. vLLM manages KV cache with a technique similar to virtual memory and paging. However, this technique requires fetching dynamic addresses and performing scatter operations, something TPUs don’t support well. As a result, TPU kernels leverage fine-grained operation pipelining. Specifically, TPU’s page attention kernel prefetches query and KV blocks for the next sequence, so the memory loading is overlapped with computation. In the existing vLLM MoE kernel, we sort tokens by expert ID, dispatch tokens to the devices with the corresponding experts, perform group matrix multiplication, and combine tokens from experts back to original devices. However, the kernel performs poorly for two reasons: TPUs are slow at performing sorting operations, and the kernel is unable to overlap communication with computation. To work around this issue, Google developers designed all-fused MoE. All-fused MoE dispatches tokens for one expert per device at a time while overlapping MoE dispatch & MoE combine communications & avoiding sorting tokens by expert ID. With all-fused MoE, the Google engineer reported 3 - 4x speedup over existing kernels. Furthermore, another hardware unit in TPUs is the SparseCore (SC) used to accelerate embedding lookups and updates. SC comes with a scalar subcore SparseCore Sequencer (SCS) and multiple vector subcores SparseCore Tiles (SCT). SCT supports local and remote direct memory access at a more fine-grained 4-byte or 32-byte granularity, compared to TPU TensorCore’s 512-byte loads. This enables SC to perform gather/scatter operations and ICI communications while overlapping with TensorCore operations. At JAX DevLabs, we learned that programmability of SparseCore is a work in progress. We can expect Mosaic, the TPU custom kernel compiler, to compile in an MPMD fashion, where SCS and SCT executes different kernels, and different SparseCores can run different programs. We suspect once the programmability catches up, TPU MoE kernels would be able to perform dispatch and combine operations in a similar way as GPUs, instead of dispatching by expert IDs. In terms of disaggregated prefill decode, which we described in depth in our AMD 2.0 post, Google has experimental support on vLLM for single host disagg PD, not they do not support multi-host wideEP disagg prefill or MTP yet. These inference optimizations are critical to lower the TCO per million tokens and increase the perf per dollar and perf per watt. Furthermore, they have not yet integrated TPU vLLM inference support into popular RL frameworks like VERL, etc. Google is slowly moving in the correct direction in terms of how they approach the open AI/ML ecosystem especially for their “native” TPU backend. This week, there was an new inference benchmark on TPUv6e that dropped claiming that TPUv6e has 5x worst performance per dollar than NVIDIA GPUs. We disagree mainly due to 2 reasons. First of all, this is benchmark is on vLLM on TPUs which was only released an couple month ago thus does not yet have optimized performance. Google internal Gemini workloads & Anthropic workloads work on an internal custom inference stack that has better perf per TCO than NVIDIA GPUs. Secondly, Aritifical Analysis’s cost per million tokens is using the list price of $2.7/hr/chip for TPUv6e. No major customers of TPUs is paying anywhere close to that much for TPUv6e given the BOM is a tiny fraction of the H100. As everyone knows, most clouds have an high ball list price such that their account sales executives can do “car salesman” tactics and give massive discounts so that the customer thinks they are getting a good deal. The SemiAnalysis AI TCO Model tracks the acutal market rental price of TPUs across all the various contract lengths (1 month, 1 year, 3 years, etc). One part where Google is still approaching their software strategy incorrectly is with their XLA graph compiler & networking libraries & TPU runtime is still not open sourced nor well documented. This has led to frustrated users across the spectrum from advanced users to the average user of not being able to debug what is going wrong with their code. Furthermore their MegaScale codebase for multi-pod training is not open source either. We strongly believe that in order to accelerate the adoption, Google should open source it and the increased user adoption will outweigh all the software IP they will make public & free. Just like how PyTorch or Linux being open sourced rapidly increased adoption, open sourcing XLA:TPU & TPU runtime & networking libs will rapidly accelerated this too. Now that Google has gotten their act together on TPU and is selling them externally for people to put in their own datacenters, what are the implications on Nvidia’s business? Does Nvidia finally have a legitimate competitor that will put its market share and margins at threat? Behind the paywall, we will share our thoughts on what this means for Nvidia as well as reveal more about the TPU roadmap.

Donald Trump with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, prime minister of Saudi Arabia, during a meeting in the White House on November 18. Photo: Getty Madam — Peter Vandermeersch is right to refuse to accept moral shrugging as a form of leadership (‘Journalists must always challenge Trump’s cynical shrug in the face of evil’, November 23). When Donald Trump dismissed the murder of Jamal Khashoggi with the phrase “things happen”, he did more than trivialise a brutal assassination. He signalled that truth and human dignity are negotiable when wealth and influence are in play. That is a message the world cannot afford to normalise. Truth is not a luxury of stable societies; it is the foundation that allows them to exist. When leaders treat facts as inconveniences and atrocities as diplomatic embarrassments, they erode the very principles that underpin international order. If a journalist can be murdered and dismembered and the response from a global superpower is a shrug foll­owed by arms deals and photo opportunities, then the world’s moral compass has been deliberately set off course. Power does not absolve responsibility — it multiplies it. World leaders, particularly those who claim to stand for freedom and democratic values, have an obligation to call out wrongdoing, even when it threatens trade, oil or investment. Economic partnerships built on silence are not partnerships at all; they are transactions bought with integrity. When nations choose profit over principle, they teach every autocrat watching that violence carries no cost and that censorship can triumph over accountability. Khashoggi’s death was not a “thing” that “happened”. It was a crime — one aimed at silencing truth itself. To ignore that is to betray not only his memory, but the essential belief that facts matter and human life matters. If democracies will not speak when the powerful commit wrongs, who will? The price of truth may sometimes be economic, but the price of abandoning it is far greater: a world where nothing is sacred, and everything — even life — can be shrugged away. Paul Byrne, Dublin 7 Madam — Eilis O’Hanlon is right to highlight the absurd loop in which the State finds itself with Enoch Burke (‘How do you solve a problem like Enoch? Well, first you need to find him’, November 23). Yet the real scandal is not the institutional paralysis; it is that the education of children has been forced to orbit around one man’s unyielding dogma. Whatever convictions Mr Burke holds, they do not entitle him to turn a school into a theatre for his own absolutes. His insistence on presenting himself at the gates each morning is not an act of witness. It is a refusal to accept that pupils deserve a learning environment free from spectacle. The true innocents in this saga are not the courts or the Government, but the teenagers who now pass security guards and cameras on their way to class, all because he cannot conceive that his conscience might co-exist with their right to be left alone. Faith without humility has a habit of mistaking disruption for duty. O’Hanlon describes a stubborn dance in which the State repeats its mistakes. Burke’s greater failure is that he mistakes his certainties for a licence to disturb the everyday life of children who never sought to be part of his crusade. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran, Co Armagh Madam — In her column on Enoch Burke, Eilis O’Hanlon omits to point out the fact that a boy cannot become a girl or vice versa. This lie is being perpetuated in schools. Enoch Burke needs to be backed by the whole country for his brave stance in protecting children. There are too many families who fell for this and are now faced with the consequences in their child’s life where there has been medical intervention: infertility, inability to have a sex life, early onset of menopause, arthritis and so on. If adults wish to change to appear like the opposite sex, fine; but this should not be off­ered to children who may have underlying issues that are not being properly explored. Hopefully, the country will soon come to its senses and reinstate Mr Burke in his job and restore his money taken from his bank account. Anne Grace, Blackrock, Co Dublin Madam — John Greene’s art­icle (‘When the system fails to deliver’, Sport, November 23) shows all too clearly the damage that can be done to children when grown-ups don’t, or won’t, behave properly. In this case, a young girl was upset to the point where she felt unable to continue playing her sport. Had the gossips been correct in their supposition of the child’s gender, a young trans girl might have suffered the same fate. Either way, a child would have suffered due to the actions of people who are allegedly old enough to know better. Can the so-called adults please behave as such and let children play together in peace? Bernie Linnane, Dromahair, Co Leitrim Madam — Following a recent cancer diagnosis, I spent time in two Dublin hospitals. In one, I experienced outstanding nursing care. In the other, that care and compassion was heartbreakingly absent. In the interest of fairness, I must say that some nursing staff were kind and professional, in particular a specialist nursing team who supported my family and me with great humanity during my time of need. They were a lifeline. But overall, my experience left me shaken. As a retired nurse, I know the pressure hospital staff work under, yet no workload or staff shortage can ever justify neg­lecting a patient’s dignity. Compassion is not a luxury — it is at the core of care. One moment I will never forget: after a sleepless night, I was taken to the bathroom for personal care. The care assistant, clearly overstretched, left the door open to monitor another patient, exposing me to a male ward. My dignity and privacy were dismissed in that instant. I felt demeaned, broken and utterly vulnerable. Later, when I met my consul­tant to discuss my treatment, I felt so humiliated that I forgot all the important questions I intended to raise. That is the unseen damage that such care inflicts. Hospital management must ensure all staff — permanent or agency — be properly trained, supervised and held to the same standard. Basic training in infection control and cross infection prevention is critical.Respect, privacy and humanity are not optional. They are the difference between care and cruelty. I write not from anger, but from a hope that no patient will ever feel as I did — stripped of dignity when they most need compassion. We owe every patient better.I know we can and must do better. Hannah McCarthy, Dundrum, Dublin Madam — Fair play to Seán Ó Fearghaíl for not holding back in his attack on the leadership of Fianna Fáil (‘Fianna Fáil’s problems run much deeper than botched Áras campaign’, November 23). He hopes a new and ­exciting chapter for Fianna Fáil will begin, following his Oireachtas colleagues’ report into the presidential campaign. Really? The only outcome from that report will be to kick-start the exit of Micheál Martin as leader. Renewal or rejuvenation is another matter. Good luck with trying to latch on to young voters — they want solutions to our housing problem and less of the old-guard politics. The three main parties will continue to share the spoils of our PR system for some time. That’s as exciting as it will get for Fianna Fáil. Aidan Roddy, Cabinteely, Dublin 18 Madam — What gives Deputy Malcolm Byrne and Fianna Fáil the right to think they can rename Dublin Airport after one of their own, Seán Lemass? Dublin Airport does not belong to any one political party. Leave it alone. Walter Lacey, Bullock Park, Co Carlow Madam — Reading Sarah Breen’s article about her time as a shop assistant (‘True heroes of the spending season are shopping assistants’, November 23) reminded me of my first real job, when I started as an app­rentice in the men’s outfitting business at 15 years of age. How times have changed in the 60-plus years since. Not a hint of self-service back then. Even a tie required “selling”, laying them out in assorted boxes and making the Windsor knot on your hand for the prospective buyer. My most unusual transaction was when a woman bought a suit from me for her just-deceased husband. Apparently, the poor divil had been saving for a new suit when God issued the call. I had to be careful not to say: “If he doesn’t like it, you can exchange it.” I spent some 30 years in the trade, so in some sense it must have suited me. Tom Gilsenan, Beaumont, Dublin 9 Madam — Twink tells us she “kept The Late Late Show alive” and that the programme has only “boring, stuffed-shirts” as guests (Life, November 23). What an egotistical woman. She should be grateful for her lot — she hit the big time early in life, but things move on and she must accept that her style of entertaining is well past its sell-by date. Tom Kelly, Newbridge, Co Kildare Madam — Justifying a former taoiseach’s expensive tastes, the entertainer Twink commented in her interview with Barry Egan last week: “We had those big fat boozy, pint-drinking thugs of taoiseachs with tomato stains down their front and looking like balubas representing us....” (‘Curtains up!’, Life, November 23). While none of the holders of that office were ever my first choice, I am astounded that such a view was not challenged in the article. The description fits none in my experience. Leaving the comment there unchallenged is unfair to the people themselves and to our country. While politics is a rough and tough business and you take the robust comments on the chin, it does not have to be insulting and offensive. Democratic politics is under enough attack across the world without such puerile commentary. Cllr Dermot Lacey (Labour), Donnybrook, Dublin 4 Madam — Shane Ross last week quoted an unnamed former Fine Gael minister to soften the insult featured in his headline (‘Paschal trots off to pastures new while Fine Gael is led by donkeys’, November 23). This is crass. Here it is important to note that, in this era of declarations of interest, Shane was once a member of Fine Gael. He is used to hyperbole too. He once described Enda Kenny as a corpse, and then went on to serve under him in the Cabinet. Now that Paschal Donohoe is gone and getting praise, I don’t recall Mr Ross garlanding him with many honours while he was finance minister. A very Irish thing. You must be gone or dead to earn the plaudits. Brendan Cafferty, Ballina, Co Mayo Madam — Brendan Sweeney makes many valid points on the recent municipal and regional elections in Denmark (‘What Ireland can learn from Danish election shock’, November 23). Denmark is following in the footsteps of the Netherlands and the parliamentary elections there last month; the 38-year-old centrist liberal leader Rob Jetten is destined to be the youngest prime minister in Dutch history. His D66 party has risen spectacularly, outflanking the far-right leader Geert Wilders. Indeed, there are more similarities with the election of Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York. All of these elections were won by campaigning on what matters most to their constituents — housing, afford­ability and costs of living, instead of immigration. All of which makes it clear that Simon Harris’s foray into the debate on immigration after Fine Gael’s disastrous presidential election was nothing other than an attempt to gaslight the opposition and shift the focus from the Coalition’s very obvious policy failures. Tom McElligott, Tournageehy, Co Kerry Madam — Saoirse Hanley enthuses over President Connolly’s decision “to make Irish the working language of the Áras” and expresses her incredulity that anyone could question that decision (Life, November 23). President Connolly promised to represent each citizen equally. I presume this includes the Gaeilgeoir and the non-Irish-speaker alike. Yet a substantial section of her inaugural address was delivered “as Gaeilge”, rendering it unintelligible to the majority of her audience. There appears to be an almost evangelical push to persuade people to feel guilty for being unable to converse in their native tongue. A headline on a recent column by Naoise Dolan struck me as dogmatic and didactic: ‘We need to create an Ireland where everyone can become fluent in Irish’ (November 9). We also need to create an Ireland that is inclusive, not divisive. I refer to the President’s questionable remarks during the campaign: “Irish does not contain a false distinction between the person and nature, which exists in English. English is the language of colonisation, of extraction, of destruction.” We can surely appreciate Irish culture and language without denigrating others. The President should be more circumspect in her pronouncements or she risks alienating many of us. Personally, just because I cannot speak Irish, I am no less Irish than a fluent Gaeilgeoir. I love Irish culture in all its richness and variety. However, President Connolly, if you wish to communicate with me and with millions like me, please speak mainly in English. Brid Ewing, Newtowncunningham, Co Donegal Madam — Don Byrne (Lett­ers, November 23) tells us that systemic corporal punishment in schools left many students in the 1950s associating the Irish language with pain and humiliation. Why only Irish? Was corporal punishment not part of the reality endured in other subjects as well? The language, and people’s interest and enjoyment of it, should not be held hostage by the experiences of some schoolchildren more than seven decades ago. Daragh Breathnach, Glasnevin, Dublin 11

Title: Brad Lander’s departure as NYC comptroller is good news for Gotham’s $300B pension fund

Brad Lander won’t be New York City comptroller much longer — and that’s good news for Gotham’s rank and file. It’s not just because Lander is a knee-jerk leftist who rivals Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani when it comes to his out-of-touch patter on economic policy. He’s also a dullard seemingly unaware of the core function of the job he’s held for the last four years. Lander, as the city’s chief fiscal officer, is the fiduciary, investment adviser and custodian of the city’s $300 billion pension fund system. He’s supposed to make sure the funds are invested in securities that grow in value so they can “fully fund” the retirement accounts of all the city’s police, firefighters and teachers. Those accounts are not fully funded, and the shortfalls are poised to grow once Mamdani gets into office. Recall the mayor-elect’s pledges to raise taxes and turn the city into Moscow-on-the-Hudson, which will certainly cause more businesses and high earners to leave. Now Lander wants to oust BlackRock from managing city retirement money because it refuses to embrace his weird green energy agenda, which envisions a future of windmills and bicycles along the streets of New York instead of cars — and energy bills that no one can afford. Consider: BlackRock doesn’t suck at money management, it’s actually quite good at it. Its CEO, Larry Fink, is considered among the best risk managers in the business. BlackRock’s big crime is that it doesn’t want to be an accomplice to Lander’s wacky, unrealizable and maybe illegal campaign on the climate — i.e. reducing carbon emissions with brute force. In Lander’s mind, the stocks of companies that drill for oil, frack natural gas, keep our lights on or make sure the AC works in the summer are pure evil. The comptroller, of course, prefers those that embrace green energy — like those useless windmills off the coast of New Jersey that give the state some of the highest electricity bills on the planet. What’s more, Lander literally wants the city to demand that all of BlackRock’s clients’ portfolios — not just the NYC retirement system’s — comply with his whims under threat of NYC yanking its funds. It’s among the most narcissistically dumb ideas to ever come out of a public official. Let’s get real: little Brad Lander ain’t doing nothing to stop global warming; China keeps polluting and adding to carbon emissions every day. So does India and the rest of the ­developing world. Plus, those green stocks often really do really suck (Google “Solyndra”) while companies that invest in good old-fashioned crude like ExxonMobil — with a five-year spike in its shares of nearly 200% far outstripping the S&P — really don’t. BlackRock’s CEO, it should also be noted, is an odd target for Lander. Fink was one of the key proponents of so-called Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing, which took into account carbon emissions of companies in which it invested.

Never miss a story. He got a bad rap from the political right for it, and BlackRock lost business — that is until Fink clarified the company’s position: As Fink told Lander years ago, the NYC comptroller can’t dictate what BlackRock does for the Texas state pension. Plus, if BlackRock sold all of its $225 billion in energy-related stocks — the largest energy slug owned by any money manager — it would probably crash all major stock market indices. How is that good for NYC retirees? It isn’t, of course. It shows how little thought Lander probably put into this attention-grabbing charade as he reportedly gears up to run for a seat representing lower Manhattan and progressive parts of Brooklyn in Congress in the 2026 midterms. It also shows why lefty Manhattan Borough President and former City Councilman Mark Levine, who will replace Lander as comptroller, should just ignore his predecessor’s recommendation. Levine probably won’t, of course, given how progressively cringey NYC politics has become. I should point out that neither Lander nor Levine has the complete final say over where managers of the city’s retirement system invest all that money. That say belongs to the trustees of the funds, of which the comptroller has one vote, while the mayor appoints members as well. That doesn’t mean Lander should be given a pass in the court of public opinion for making this an issue. Nor should he be given a pass when it comes to his legal obligations as city comptroller, i.e. maximizing returns in the retirement system, as opposed to tilting at windmills. A fully functioning government should take action before Lander or whoever replaces him does even more damage to a city that has been losing population and business for years. But our local prosecutors (Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, et al) are too busy jailing citizens defending themselves from criminals to make sure a raging leftist doesn’t defund pension funds that are already underfunded — and bound to get worse as the city goes full-on socialist under our new mayor.

Title: Wildly Violent (and Profitable)

Time Published: 2025-11-29T23:00:03Z

By Adam Sharp PostedNovember 29, 2025 The story of the world’s first IPO is a wild one. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) was founded in Amsterdam in 1602. Over the next hundred years, the VOC would dominate trade with Asia, wage multiple wars, commit genocide, and build monopolies. Along the way they sold gobs of spices, silks, and opium. But before all of that could happen, the VOC’s founders needed to raise money. So in 1602 the Dutch East India Company conducted the first initial public offering, giving all Dutchmen the chance to invest in this new venture. VOC Co-Founder Dirck Van Os | Source: Wikipedia The VOC IPO was unique because it was open to anyone, not just wealthy merchants and royalty. In total, 1,143 investors participated. Co-founder Dirck Van Os’ maid, Neeltgen Cornelis, was the second-to-last investor on the registry, having subscribed 100 guilders, which was likely her life’s savings. If Mrs. Cornelis the maid held onto her shares for the long run, she did quite well. In some years, VOC investors received a dividend equivalent to 75% of the capital they initially committed. Now, that dividend occasionally came in the form of spices (cloves and mace in particular). But hey, profit is profit… Dutch historian Lodewijk Petram has calculated the return of VOC shares (with dividends reinvested), and from its founding in 1602 through 1698, each 100 guilders invested turned into about 65,000. Source: The World’s First Stock Exchange VOC shares were groundbreaking because they were tradable on what would become the world’s first stock exchange. In addition, the Dutch East India Company introduced the concept of limited liability for shareholders. In other words, investors could only lose the amount they invested. They wouldn’t be responsible for the company’s debts or losses if the venture failed. The VOC set a new standard for how companies could raise capital and distribute profits. But the business model was downright diabolical… The VOC quickly became a publicly-traded empire. By 1637 it was worth the equivalent of around $6.9 trillion in today’s money. That’s double the value of the largest modern companies such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA). The Dutch East India Company maintained its own navy with around 40 warships and 200 trading vessels at any given time. It fought wars against Spain, Portugal, Britain, and various Asian powers. These great powers clashed over lucrative trade routes and assets in Asia. They fought over territories such as the Spice Islands and the Philippines, and sold opium to China. In one notorious incident, the VOC invaded the Banda Islands, the world’s only source of nutmeg and mace at the time. Back then these spices were more valuable than gold. Using mercenaries which included Japanese samurai, VOC Governor-General Jan Pieterszoon Coen brutally massacred the Bandanese, publicly executing its leaders. Of around 15,000 natives, only a few hundred are believed to have survived. The VOC brought in slaves and other workers to take over Banda’s nutmeg and mace operations. These newly-acquired plantations were wildly profitable for shareholders. The company now had a total monopoly on two of the most valuable spices, which they sold into European markets at 1,000% markups. The Dutch East India Company was basically a publicly-traded evil empire. But for many years it did succeed in its mission of rewarding shareholders. Over time, however, the company lost its monopoly on spices and trade with Asia. Nutmeg and mace were smuggled out of Banda and cultivated elsewhere. Eventually the price of these once-rare goods collapsed. Artificial monopolies can only last so long. The VOC became increasingly corrupt and bureaucratic. It took on too much debt, and in time it essentially became a ponzi scheme. Ever-increasing debt loads were required to pay dividends. That’s a classic sign of the end approaching. The British East India Company eventually became a fierce competitor and seized many of the VOC’s prime territories. In 1799 the Dutch government dissolved the VOC and absorbed its assets and debts. The company had lasted almost 200 years. Despite the evil deeds committed by the Dutch East India Company, the firm played a critical role in the history of finance. It set a new standard for how companies could raise money and distribute profits to shareholders.

Title: Paschi, Investors Coordinated to Buy Mediobanca, Prosecutors Say
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/paschi-investors-coordinated-to-buy-mediobanca-prosecutors-say-11764453409111.html
Time Published: 2025-11-29T21:56:48Z
Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA Chief Executive Officer Luigi Lovaglio and two prominent Italian investors allegedly coordinated actions to seize control of Mediobanca SpA and tighten their grip on Assicurazioni Generali SpA, according to documents compiled in a probe by Milan prosecutors. Prosecutors describe an alleged multiyear strategy by billionaire Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and Chairman Francesco Milleri of Delfin Sarl, two of the largest investors in Mediobanca and Generali, to take control of the Milan-based investment bank — with the ultimate goal of controlling Generali, Italy’s biggest insurer. A key step in the plan was last year’s purchase of a Monte Paschi stake by Italy’s government, part of a process prosecutors described as orchestrated and lacking transparency. After the purchase, Caltagirone and Milleri built up a deal in coordination with Lovaglio that allowed Monte Paschi to take over Mediobanca, without properly disclosing their alignment to the market to the potential detriment of other investors, according to the 35-page document seen by Bloomberg. Prosecutors allege the project was executed in breach of Italian market rules and through coordinated behavior that was capable of influencing Mediobanca’s share price. Monte Paschi completed the €17 billion ($19.7 billion) acquisition of Mediobanca in September, creating Italy’s third-largest lender by assets in a government-backed deal. Milan prosecutors are investigating alleged market manipulation by Lovaglio, Milleri and Caltagirone and obstruction of regulators tied to Monte Paschi’s takeover of its smaller rival. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s government and the Finance Ministry in Rome aren’t under investigation and none of the individuals or companies have been charged with wrongdoing. Prosecutors allege that concealed coordination meant the participants didn’t have to pool their stakes and allowed them to avoid the obligation to launch a costly mandatory cash takeover bid once their combined stake surpassed the 25% threshold in Mediobanca. Monte Paschi said Thursday the bank “is confident it can provide all the necessary information to clarify the correctness of its actions.” Delfin said its board “always acted in full compliance with market rules and laws.” Caltagirone Group said its representatives “consistently acted in accordance with the rules governing the market.” All declined to comment further when reached by Bloomberg outside business hours on Saturday. The documents trace the origins of the project back almost a decade. Delfin and the Caltagirone group have been significant shareholders since at least 2016. Starting in 2019, they allegedly pursued control through parallel and coordinated investments in both Generali and its main shareholder, Mediobanca. Mediobanca is the largest shareholder in Generali with a 13.2% stake. Delfin — the Del Vecchio family’s holding company — owns 10.1% of the insurer and Caltagirone controls 6.3%, according to Generali’s website. Delfin also holds 17.5% in Monte Paschi and Caltagirone has a 10.3% stake, making them among that bank’s largest shareholders — and both built sizeable positions in Mediobanca before committing their shares to the offer. The overlapping stakes created a dense web of influence linking Italy’s largest insurer, its main shareholder Mediobanca and Monte Paschi — the vehicle used in the takeover. Investigators allege the two camps gradually converged, with stakes in Generali and Mediobanca rising in lockstep and their voting behavior becoming increasingly aligned. Treasury Role The strategy entered its final phase in November 2024, when Italy’s Treasury sold a 15% stake in Monte Paschi through an accelerated bookbuilding, according to the documents, elements of which were reported earlier by Corriere della Sera. Prosecutors say the sale was structured in a way that favored buyers aligned with the Mediobanca takeover plan — namely Caltagirone and Delfin, which offered the same price for the same number of shares within minutes of each other. A rapid closing of the order book shut out other interested investors such as UniCredit SpA and BlackRock Inc. While the Finance Ministry and its representatives aren’t under investigation, the document cites the government’s role, arguing the sale was characterized by “opacity and anomalies.” The sale appeared steered toward predetermined buyers, raising questions over potential conflicts of interest given the Treasury’s dual role as both seller of the stake and late backer of Monte Paschi’s offer, according to the court documents. Italy’s Finance Ministry acted in compliance with rules and procedures, an official told Bloomberg on Saturday when asked to comment on the investigation.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs Are Now BlackRock’s Top Revenue Source, Exec Says
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/11/29/bitcoin-etfs-are-now-blackrock-s-top-revenue-source-exec-says
Time Published: 2025-11-29T20:49:25Z
Full Content:
BlackRock’s bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become the firm’s most profitable product line, according to Cristiano Castro, director of business development at BlackRock Brazil. The figure is notable given that the firm manages over 1,400 ETFs globally and is the world’s largest asset manager with more than $13.4 trillion in assets under management. Speaking at the Blockchain Conference in São Paulo to local media, Castro called the development “a big surprise” and said that allocations in the firm’s bitcoin ETFs, including the U.S.-based IBIT and Brazil’s IBIT39, had come close to $100 billion. “When we launched, we were optimistic,” Castro said, “but we didn’t expect this scale.” The firm’s U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETF IBIT, launched in January 2024, became the fastest in history to reach $70 billion in assets, doing so in 341 days. That momentum has continued despite recent volatility in bitcoin’s price, with the ETF currently sitting at $70.7 billion in net assets according to SoSoValue data. Net inflows exceeded $52 billion in its first year, far outpacing all other ETFs launched in the last decade. IBIT also generated an estimated $245 million in annual fees by October 2025. IBIT’s rapid growth has been fueled by BlackRock’s global distribution network and a wave of institutional interest following U.S. regulatory approval of spot bitcoin ETFs. It now holds over 3% of bitcoin’s total supply, and it was followed by various BTC-linked products from BlackRock, including ETPs overseas. Castro addressed recent outflows from bitcoin funds, saying that such movement is expected given how retail investors tend to react to price drops. “ETFs are a very liquid and powerful tool. They’re meant for people to manage flows,” he said. BlackRock itself has been betting on its bitcoin ETF. Its Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio has recently raised its stake in IBIT by 14%. CoinDesk has reached out to BlackRock but didn't hear back at the time of writing.

Title: Update: Coping With Inflation–Strategies for Investing, Bartering, Dickering, and Survival
URL: https://survivalblog.com/2025/11/30/update-coping-with-inflation-strategies-for-investing-bartering-dickering-and-survival/
Time Published: 2025-11-29T20:00:33Z
Full Content:
JWR’s Introductory Note: This is an update to an article that I wrote for SurvivalBlog back in December, 2007. It is part of a series of SurvivalBlog 20th Anniversary update re-posts, in recognition of the fact that the majority of readers did not join us until recent years. — As of September, 2025, statistics released by the Federal government claim that the current inflation rate is 3.0 percent. That is utter hogwash. Their statistics cunningly omit “volatile” food and energy prices. It is apparent that something is seriously out of whack. Meanwhile, the buying power of the US Dollar has fallen versus most other currencies. Both under Biden’s administration and now under Trump’s second term, economic growth has slowed substantially. Ironically, even though credit squeezes are considered deflationary for assets, the next recession (or perhaps depression) will probably turn out to be inflationary at the consumer level. With out-of-control Federal deficit spending and a massive, compounding National Debt, I expect to see inflation continue and accelerate in the coming years. Here at the Rawles Ranch, our four largest expenses each month are fuel, groceries, livestock feed, and insurance. Our health insurance costs have nearly doubled in the past two years. The average new car now costs $50,000. I’m sure that you have seen what has happened to food and feed prices in the past two years. Driven by higher fuel and fertilizer costs, some food costs have gone up by 25%. Beef prices, for example, recently spiked to near record highs. With all of the preceding in mind, we can realistically conclude that the “real world” consumer price inflation rate is somewhere around 12%. As I’ve written many times before, inflation is a form of robbery, albeit in slow motion. Since there is effectively only one currency in our country, it is the only way to do business. It may prove difficult, but you need to discard your traditional mindset about the currency and realize that we are riding a down escalator. An inflationary environment stands traditional logic on its head, since “Saving” becomes losing, and “Investing” is almost like throwing coins into a pond if the rate of return of any investment is lower than the real world inflation rate. The only noteworthy exception is investing in tangibles, which I’ve discussed at length in many SurvivalBlog articles and columns. Obviously, you can’t invest in anything perishable. But there are lots of practical things–like tools, common caliber ammunition and full capacity magazines–that have storage lives that can span decades or even centuries. With every passing day, your savings are gradually eroded. With an effective inflation rate of 12% per annum, applying the Rule of 72 we can see how much the purchasing power of every “saved” dollar is reduced over time. The following are some of my suggestions on how to protect yourself from the ravages of inflation: A.) Buy in Bulk Buy most of your staple foods and groceries at a discount or “warehouse” type stores such as Costco or Sam’s Club. Don’t overlook the “close-out” and “dented can” stores. (But, of course, avoid buying any bulged cans, or cans with dented rims.) Stock up on non-perishable items whenever they are on sale: thing like light bulbs, paper products, bar soap, house cleaning supplies, laundry detergent, lubricants, and so forth. As long as you protect these supplies from theft, moisture and vermin, they are better than money in the bank. (Again, money in the bank is being eroded by inflation.) These are tangibles bought at today’s prices, that you can use for many years to come. Here at the Rawles Ranch, we recently used up some spices, light bulbs, and aluminum foil that I bought at a military commissary in the 1980s–at what now seem like absurdly low prices. My only regret is that I didn’t buy more of them! This approach to stockpiling was described in the modern-day classic book “The Alpha Strategy” by John Pugsley. (Download this free book and read it!) If your local zoning and fire regulations allow it, buy your own gas and diesel fuel tanks. Also consider installing oversize propane or home heating oil tanks. Always ask about the availability of used tanks or ‘trade-in” tanks. Who cares if they are in some odd color? Re-paint them a nice neutral tan color. Wait and have your extra-large tanks re-filled each time there is a price dip. (Sadly, this only happens rarely, these days.) When getting competitive bids from tank suppliers, be sure to ask them to lock in the price per gallon for the initial fill for each new tank. To win your business, the tank salesman might be willing to commit to a price that is a few pennies per gallon below current market. (This adds up on a 2,000+ gallon tank!) B.) Learn to Barter Barter, by its very nature, shields you from inflation. Instead of using depreciating paper tokens as a means of exchange, you are directly exchanging a tangible for another tangible, or a service for a tangible, or a service for a service. As I’ve written previously in SurvivalBlog on several occasions, I do advocate stocking up on extra items for barter. However, it is with the proviso that you do not embark on buying goods dedicated for barter until after you have your family’s essential beans, bullets and band-aids squared away, following a well-balanced logistics plan. Dickering is a skill that can take years to develop. For some details on dickering skills, dee my updated SurvivalBlog article: The Savvy Barterer: References, Skills, and Tools for TEOTWAWKI Barter. Here in The Un-named Western State (TUWS), there is a lot of bartering that goes on, quite informally. I see it all the time: Cartridge Reloading for Snow Plowing, Eggs for Honey, Firewood for Horse Training, and Zucchini for just a smile and a thank-you. To be useful in barter, choose items that have most or all of the following seven attributes 1.) Have appeal/usefulness to the majority of the citizenry. 2.) Be immediately recognizable. 3.) Have longevity. 4.) Be easily divisible. 5.) Be relatively compact and transportable at reasonable cost. 6.) Have consistent quality. 7.) Have limited availability. Let’s discuss each of those briefly, in turn. 1.) Have appeal/usefulness to the majority of the citizenry. Nearly every family uses soap, but just a few need #7 Singer sewing machine needles. 2.) Be immediately recognizable. Name brands need no introduction. All others are suspect. 3.) Have longevity. Keep shelf lives in mind. If you cannot barter it all away before it goes bad, then you are buying too much. Even coal has a shelf life. 4.) Be easily divisible. Boxes of matches, boxes of cartridges, coils of rope, balls of twine, and cans of kerosene are perfect examples. OBTW, if you plan on dividing a commodity in barter transactions, then be sure to have the containers needed for parceling it out. 5.) Be relatively compact and transportable at a reasonable cost. Toilet paper has great appeal, but just $500 worth would completely fill the JASBORR. 6.) Have consistent quality. (For example, precious metals coins of known purity, or ammunition from a major manufacturer such as Winchester, Remington, or Federal.) 7.) Have limited availability. I mentioned zucchini earlier, for good reason. In North America, jars of freeze-dried instant coffee would be ideal, but in Central America, they would probably be laughed at. For some extensive lists of potential barter items suggested by readers, see the SurvivalBlog Archives for October 2005 and November 2005 (scroll down to November 1st and 2nd.) For a good rationale on selecting barter goods, see this November, 2006 SurvivalBlog article by OSOM. C.) Learn Several Valuable (Barterable) Skills Every family should have at least one home-based business that they can fall back on, on the event of an economic recession or depression. Concentrate on skills rather than goods for barter. The beauty of having skills to barter, is that most of them don’t require much raw material. So, unlike barter goods, you will never “run out”. By extension, it is best to have a skill that requires very little raw material. A profession or skill that also requires a specialized tool set is fine. However, if the skill also requires delivering a factory-made device to complete each transaction, then you might consider doing something else. (For example, installing burglar alarms might be profitable as long as you have a source of resupply, and as long as the power and telephone networks are functioning. But in a grid-down TEOTWAWKI how long could you continue running such a business?) Avoid developing a skill that appeals only to wealthy customers for discretionary spending. Those are the purchases that will be delayed or skipped altogether in an economic depression, Hence, shotgun checkering and engraving are poor choices, but septic tank pumping is a good one. Concentrate on a business that can be operated without the need for grid power. It is notewothy that most of the businesses in this category existed in the 19th Century. Who knows? Maybe buggy whip makers will make a comeback in the Second Great Depression. Ideally, you should have two or even three supplementary income businesses that you can fall back on to pay your mortgage and to buy necessities, if you lose your salaried job. Depending on the severity of the coming recession or depression, some home-based business may thrive, while others won’t. It is hard to predict which businesses will do well (although we have some clues based on the experience of the 1930s,) so there is safety in redundancy. D.) Learn How to Pinch a Penny Here are some suggestions (in no particular order), some of which I’ve borrowed from “The Encyclopedia of Country Living” by Carla Emery. (We highly recommend this book.) Distinguish your needs from your wants. Research and do some comparison pricing before any purchase of more than $10. Do extensive comparison pricing before any purchase of more than $100. Never buy on impulse. Plan your purchases well in advance, do your homework, and be patient. Refer to back issues of Consumer Reports magazine (at your local library) before making a purchase of a major appliance Develop the habit of dropping by thrift stores, second-hand stores, used book stores, and pawn shops. Find out on which days particular items are discounted at thrift stores. (Often by a system of colored price tags.) For big-ticket items, do lots of comparison pricing via the Internet. If you decide to buy locally, then bring the price print-outs with you, to use as “ammunition” when you dicker. Buy off-season. Buy winter clothes in summer, and vice versa. Buy livestock in October and November, when owners are facing expensive hay purchases if they “winter-over” their livestock. Use a clothesline instead of an electric clothes dryer. Use online tools like GasBuddy to find the best local gas and diesel prices. This is particularly important when you re-fill your gasoline and diesel storage cans and drums. Heat with wood. Cut, haul, split, and stack the wood yourself. Buy your guns and ammo at gun shows, not at gun shops. Learn how to dicker for the best prices. Buy at farm auctions, but beware of impulse purchases and run-away bidding. Make a list of your maximum bids during the preview and then stick to it religiously. Never bid emotionally, and never jump in on the bidding for an article unless you planned to bid on it before the auction began. Build/make/sew things for yourself rather than buying them factory-made. If you use any national brands, then clip coupons. Keep your coupons well organized (many folks like to use an accordion folder and they keep it handy in their car), and don’t lose track of coupon expiration dates. Buy most items used, rather than new. Never buy a new “big ticket” item like a car or truck “factory new”. Be sure to refer to Edmunds.com before making any vehicle purchase, to make sure you aren’t getting a “lemon” model or model-year. If you are buying a used vehicle worth $5,000 or more, then get the car’s VIN and pay for a CARFAX vehicle history report. These reports show a car’s crash history and even flood damage history. That research is well worth the expense. Negotiate prices with merchants. It is amazing who is willing to negotiate. (But I’ve had no luck in talking down bridge toll fees. I’ll keep trying.) Spend some of your Saturday mornings at garage sales and yard sales. Dress down when you go, and don’t be afraid to negotiate for better prices. Check Craig’sList, Facebook Marketplace, eBay, and your local “penny” or “nickel” classified ad papers for bargain items or even free items. Avoid fashion trends. Dress and drive modestly. Find out when there is a curb-side “free hauling” day offered by your local waste disposal contractor. If allowable by local law, cruise through the neighborhoods the night before the scheduled collection with your pickup or trailer. This is the way we found the majority of our small livestock cages. When buying things from private parties or small businesses, offer other items or your skills in barter. Watch for free tours at educational places like factories and museums. If your community has a well-established local currency, then utilize it to the utmost. Plant a large vegetable garden. Get plant starts for berries and other perennials from neighbors Cancel your newspaper subscriptions and carefully limit your magazine subscriptions. These days, there is so much news and information available on the Internet free of charge (you are looking at some of it right now) that hardcopy newspapers are now mostly expensive dinosaurs. But there are two notable exceptions: 1.) If you are a consistent and well-organized coupon clipper. If that is the case, then you might want to get a “Sunday paper only” subscription.), and 2.) Subscribing to small-town weekly newspapers in your retreat locale. Reading one of these papers regularly is important for developing local intelligence and for “fitting in” by being knowledgeable about local geography, personalities, events, politics, and lore. Change your own car crankcase oil and make most of your own car repairs. Buy a food dehydrator. It will pay for itself many times over. Home Freeze-Dryers are also now available, but before buying one, carefully consider how much you will use it. It takes a long time for these expensive units to pay for themselves. Learn how to do your own water bath and pressure canning. Once you have, you’ll have no excuse to ever buy another store-bought jar of jam, jelly, or applesauce. Buy a few dairy sheep or a cow. Sell or barter the excess milk, or feed the excess to your chickens and/or hogs Cut out needless expenses. (Like those $4 lattes at Starbucks and $20 trips to the movie theater.) If you have a mortgage at a rate that is more than 1 percent higher than the prevailing rate, then consider refinancing. Just beware of any hidden costs and, of course, avoid Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs.) Swap CDs and DVDs with friends and relatives or check them out from your local library rather than buying new ones. Keep your online video subscriptions to a minimum. Develop a budget, and stick to it. If you have a credit card, then pay it off in full every month. No exceptions! Don’t fall into the easy credit trap. Remember, the card is only in your wallet for convenience, emergency expenses (such as car repairs when travelling), and as a means to gain frequent flier miles or points for programs like gasoline purchase rebates. If you recognize that you don’t have sufficient self-control, then leave your credit card(s) at home–or cut them up. Make detailed lists of all of your expenses, and scrutinize them weekly. Look for ways to reduce expenses. Shop around for the lowest car/health/home/life insurance rates. A few hours of research on the Internet could easily save you $1,000+ per year. Unless you know for certain that you want a book as a permanent reference, then use the public library or try to find it online. Don’t overlook the inter-library loan system. Take advantage of free or low-cost training available from organizations like the American Red Cross and FEMA. (Just beware of any socialist/statist nonsense that they try to feed you along with the training.) Learn how to repair small appliances and engines. Don’t buy store-bought meat. Hunt for or raise your own. Handload your own ammunition. Get out of debt and stay out of debt. Paying interest is throwing money away. Forestall making purchases to avoid indebtedness. Instant gratification creates decades of debt. Proviso #1: Do not attempt to save money by foregoing carrying insurance, or by forestalling any expenses that have an impact on health, hygiene, or safety. For example, if your windshield gets cracked beyond repair, then replace it. If your chimney needs cleaning, then don’t delay cleaning it. (But of course buy your own brush and rod sections and learn how to do the job yourself.) If you have a toothache, don’t delay in seeing your dentist. (But ask about possibly paying in barter when you do!) Proviso# 2: Don’t be “Penny-wise and Pound-foolish.” If you are a highly-paid professional, then take into account the value of your time. For example, if you are an anesthesiologist, you should probably find a few more billable cases rather than taking up cartridge handloading. Proviso# 3: Don’t skimp on education. That is an expense that will make you money in the long run.

In what is being seen as one of the largest internal protest at a tech firm, more than 1,000 employees have signed an open letter warning against the impact of the company's strong AI push. The letter, reviewed by The Guardian, points out AI's triple threat to employment, democracy and climate. Staff from across tech giants like Meta, Google, Apple and Microsoft have backed the letter and engineers, product managers and warehouse workers from Amazon are among the signatories. The letter comes in the backdrop of layoffs made by Amazon as part of its AI expansion plan through scaling up the use of artificial intelligence tools across operations; in turn, prompting questions around crucial topics like job security, workplace surveillance and environmental impact. The layoff announcements in recent period have been seen through the prism of multibillion-dollar commitments for new AI-linked data centres in the US along with rapid AI automations. This is something which has compounded fears of further job cuts, on top of an already mounting pressures related to higher productivity quotas. A senior software engineer was quoted by The Guardian as saying that employees are feeling the pressure to use AI tools for coding and writing, and underscored that management now expects "twice as much work because of AI tools". Another worker highlighted that the use of AI tools is being used as a justification for random productivity quotas despite the tools not bridging the gap. The worker-led initiative also calls upon Amazon to ensure that its data centres run on clean energy so as not to deteriorate the climate situation further. Moreover, it also demands restricting AI products that could encourage and enable "violence, surveillance and mass deportation", and creation of worker-led bodies to oversee how AI is deployed internally. The protest at one of the world’s largest technology companies has become a symbol of growing internal distress among workers along with their resistance to generative AI is reshaping workflows and power dynamics.

Title: Elegant cocktail watches, a Kashmir sapphire ring and a tiara that turns into a necklace

As purchases of jewellery and watches peak at this time of the year, auctioneers have been busy selecting antique pieces for their pre-Christmas auctions. But, before we go there, it’s interesting to note how Courtville Antiques is drawing in potential customers by offering classes in the history of jewellery design. “There are classes on how to make jewellery, or how to grade gemstones, but we are keen to run courses looking at how jewellery styles evolved through historic fashion icons and how jewellery featured in portrait paintings,” explains Matthew Weldon, owner of Courtville Gallery in Dublin’s Powerscourt Townhouse Centre. This columnist was one of the 42 attendees last week at the pilot courses, which Weldon hopes to develop through Courtville Academy in 2026. Each two-hour class offered a whistle-stop tour through the jewellery styles from Victorian to Art Deco and Art Nouveau to Edwardian eras. For instance, did you know that Victorian jewellery often had a secret language coded into the design of the piece? A brooch with consecutive ruby, emerald, garnet, amethyst, ruby and diamond stones spells regard, indicating the esteem the giver held for the recipient. During the suffragette movement, a brooch with stones in green and violet had the hidden meaning “give votes to women”. And did you know that the introduction of platinum in Edwardian times enabled jewellery designers to create more delicate, yet still strong necklaces, brooches and rings? In the classes, Paris-based jewellery historian Véronique Goguen, and Courtville’s jewellery historian, Efthymia Sigkoudi, explained the historical context of jewellery designs, while participants tested their new knowledge to identify brooches, necklaces, rings and bracelets from the different periods. But back to the auctions: Adam’s Fine Jewellery and Ladies’ Watches auction on Tuesday December 2nd has an intriguing collection of watches from the late 1800s through to the 1970s. This single-owner collection offers us another short history lesson in the origins of wristwatches, worn more by women initially than men. From the late 1800s onwards, robust wrist watches became more practical than pocket watches for men at war planning synchronised battle attacks. And it was a Brazilian pilot, Alberto Santos-Dumont, who first commissioned his friend, French watchmaker Louis Cartier, to design a wristwatch for him for use during flying. In contrast, ladies’ watches were first designed as bracelets – often with the watch itself concealed in the design. The 1940s Vacheron & Constantin retro secret bracelet watch (€8,000-€12,000) is one example of this style, as is the Kutchinsky Jaeger-LeCoultre cocktail bracelet with its tiny watch hidden inside a shell-like shield (€6,000-€8,000). The Cartier Art Deco-style pearl, diamond and onyx cocktail watch (€12,000-€18,000) is a more subtly stylish watch, also for sale as part of this single-owner collection. Adam’s director of jewellery, Claire Mestrallet, is also very excited by the inclusion of another Kashmir sapphire in a sapphire and diamond ring (€100,000-€150,000). It is for sale on behalf of a member of the Guerlain family, owners of the famous French perfume house. This will be the fourth Kashmir sapphire for sale at Adam’s in 2025; the first sold for a record €660,000 in May, and another two Kashmir sapphire brooches sold in September for €1.36 million. Kashmir sapphires are particularly valuable, because they were excavated from a small mine in the Indian province for only about five years in the 1880s. Mestrallet says that each Kashmir sapphire has been a “discovery”. When she suspected she had another Kashmir sapphire set in to a ring by French jeweller Boucheron, her fellow directors and even the laboratory technicians doubted her instincts. “When the lady brought me in her jewellery for sale, I thought it was a Kashmir sapphire, but I didn’t say anything. I told the directors we should have it tested and they laughed at me,” explains Mestrallet. However, her instincts were correct and she now expects potential international buyers to arrive in Dublin to view the ring. “I had people flying in from India, Hong Kong and Australia for the earlier auctions with Kashmir sapphires,” she says. A late 19th-century diamond tiara, which converts to a necklace (€5,000-€7,000), is another exquisitely made piece. Adam’s is also holding an auction of men’s watches on December 3rd, with highlights including an extremely rare Longines Sommatore chronograph wristwatch (€40,000-€80,000) and a Rolex Submariner Date (€10,000-€15,000). Meanwhile, Adams of Blackrock is hosting an online jewellery and watches auction, which ends on December 3rd. With a wide variety of rings, pendants, earrings and bracelets, with estimates starting from around €150-€450, this auction has many pieces that would make for more affordable Christmas presents. There is also a good range of antique watches, including a Cartier Panthère de Cartier (€1,200-€1,400), and an 18-carat gold nurse’s brooch/watch (€350-€450). More unusually, the auction also has a kimono-style dress worn by the late Irish singer Sínead O’Connor, designed by Joanne Hayes (€600-€800). Designer handbags also feature, including a black Chanel quilted flap bag (€1,800 – €2,000) and a Louis Vuitton Speedy 30 bag in damier azur canvas (€500-€600). Estimate: €6,000-€9,000 Hammer price: €6,000 Auction house: deVeres Estimate: €200,000-€300,000 Hammer price: €340,000 Auction house: deVeres Estimate: €14,000-€18,000 Hammer price: €26,000 Auction house: deVeres Estimate: €3,000-€5,000 Hammer price: €4,000 Auction house: deVeres Keep up to date with fashion news and trends for you and your home.

More Cyber Monday home tech deals: Cyber Monday falls on Dec. 1 this year, which means it is today. The shopping day always lands on the Monday right after Thanksgiving, and as expected, hundreds of price cuts and major online sales are live across the biggest retailers. However, the day is almost over, and deals are already disappearing. If you've got your eye on something, now is the time to shop. Almost all major retailers offer tons of deals and discounts for Cyber Monday. Think of companies like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart and Target, as well as more specialized retailers such as B&H Photo, GameStop and Dell. Keep in mind that physical locations can also run out of stock, so there are pros and cons to shopping in‑store and online. Cyber Monday sales are running right now, but they won't linger much longer. Many retailers launched their deals last week for Black Friday, and although that's now behind us, plenty of fresh discounts have been rolling in for Cyber Monday. But as the day starts winding down, so will the sales. Some CNET readers are concerned about tariffs and how they could affect holiday shopping. It’s possible tariffs could impact pricing, as we’ve seen related hikes in the past, including on Nintendo Switch consoles. But that doesn’t mean you can’t find great deals on tech and other items. The best way to determine if you’re getting a good deal is to track the item’s price history before making a purchase. Tools like CamelCamelCamel and Price Tracker, or the Keepa browser extension can help. We’ve rounded up several useful shopping resources, and we’ll highlight the best deals we find throughout the event. Not necessarily. Cyber Monday focuses largely on tech, home and lifestyle deals that exist both in person and online. While it started as an online alternative to Black Friday, the two events have blended together as more shopping moves online. That doesn’t mean all the deals are identical, but it does mean finding fresh discounts has become more challenging. The term “black” has historically been used to denote distressing or calamitous events. The earliest known use of Black Friday for the Friday after Thanksgiving was to describe workers calling in sick the day after Thanksgiving in the early 1950s. Around that same time, US police adopted the term to describe the traffic conditions during the first major holiday shopping date. After attempts to rebrand it as “Big Friday” failed, merchants reframed Black Friday as a positive -- the profits generated put stores “back in the black” financially. Then, in 2005, the National Retail Federation coined the term “Cyber Monday” after noticing a spike in online traffic the Monday following Thanksgiving. At the time, it was believed shoppers were making online purchases at work to hide gifts from kids and take advantage of faster internet connections. Other names like “Black Monday” or “Blue Monday” were floated, but “Cyber Monday” stuck. By 2014, Cyber Monday had become the biggest online shopping day in the US.

Title: Will LIC Stand Firm Or Will It Bend Against External Influence?

There is growing noise around LIC’s investments, with some groups targeting it along with groups like Adani and Reliance, calling them “risky.” This is an attempt to influence LIC’s decisions through media and social media pressure. Between 2010 and 2013, similar campaigns targeting India’s coal, energy and power and defence sectors led to a policy paralysis resulting in economic failures and large NPAs in public sector banks. Stocks like Coal India, NTPC, ONGC, BHEL, and Hindustan Aeronautics faced stalled decisions due to external pressure. If LIC hesitates due to public pressure or selective criticism, it could delay vital long-term investments in India’s infrastructure and capital markets, harming the country’s financial stability. Its important that LIC remains firm on its stands so it protects policyholders’ money and supports India’s long-term growth. Facts: LIC is not just another company. It is India’s largest financial institution, managing Rs 55 lakh crore of the nation’s savings. Almost every Indian family has some connection with LIC. That is why any attack on LIC’s credibility does not just affect LIC — it affects India’s trust in its own institutions. Some organised groups are spreading selective information, but they do not tell you that private institutions like SBI Life, HDFC Life, HDFC, ICICI, Kotak, and many mutual funds hold similar or sometimes larger exposures in the same companies. Singling out only LIC creates confusion and unnecessary fear. LIC follows strict rules — no special treatment for anyone LIC cannot invest more than 1% of its total fund in any corporate group. Every investment has to go through: Detailed checks, IRDAI regulations, Board approvals. Reliance on Proxy Advisors No single officer or politician can decide where LIC invests. LIC’s money is spread across the entire economy LIC has investments in 300+ top Indian companies — Adani, Reliance, Tata, Aditya Birla and many more. It does not depend on any one group or one sector. In fact, LIC’s investments have multiplied because of this disciplined approach. Its equity portfolio grew from Rs 1.5 lakh crore in 2014 to Rs 15.5 lakh crore today — a 10x increase. Most of the remaining fund — about Rs 40 lakh crore — is in AAA-rated government debt and in ‘AAA’ rated assets from other companies such as Adanis, Tatas and Reliance--the safest category of investment. But why is LIC being targeted now? A lot of the criticism focuses on LIC’s investment in one or two particular groups such as Adani and Reliance. But look at the facts: Since 2017, LIC invested about Rs 31,000 crore in Adani group. Today, the value is around Rs 65,000 crore. That is not a loss — that is a gain because of proper due diligence. In debt, LIC invested Rs 5,000 crore ‘AAA’ rated bonds from Adani which drew so much attention. Meanwhile, similar or larger investments in the same group have been made since LIC’s investment by US insurers like Athene Life, MetLife ($750 million/Rs 6,700 crore) and by Indian institutions like HDFC Bank (Rs 10,000 crore+), Japan’s largest banks such as MUFG and Mizuho, and some of Europe’s largest Banks such as DZ World (Germany’s largest bank, BNP Paribas, Barclays and Standard Chartered. Blackrock, world’s largest fund has also invested in Adani Group in May 2025. But no one questions them. This selective criticism creates doubt, not clarity. It can lead to decision paralysis, similar to what India faced between 2010 and 2013, when confusion around coal, power and defence halted projects and slowed the economy. Why LIC invests in companies like Adani and Reliance that own infrastructure? To understand this, think simply: If you want stability, you invest in something that gives steady income every year. Infrastructure — power lines, airports, ports, energy distribution, and logistics — gives exactly that. It is predictable and steady, like rent from a house or income from a shop. This is not an Indian idea — this is a global insurance model. Look at Warren Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway Many people admire Warren Buffett. His company controls major infrastructure assets in the North America (US and Canada): Electric generation power plants (Coal, natural gas and hydro) Transmission and distribution assets in North America (US and Canada) and Uk Solar and wind plants Natural Gas storage facilities and pipelines Largest railroads and rail maintenance companies in North America Some of the companies it owns includes Mid American Energy Cmopany, PacifiCorp, NV Energy, Northern Powergrid, BHE Pipeline Group, BHE Renewables, BNSF Railway, Altalinks etc. Berkshire generates near 20% of profits only from infrastructure sector. Interestingly, these are the very infrastructure areas where India’s largest infra player Adani operates with assets that are rated ‘AAA’ or safest by any standards by all rating agencies. Despite that anti-India forces want LIC to not invest in companies like Adani and Reliance. A Rs 5,000 crore (0.1% of LIC’s total AUM) recent investment(May 2025) by LIC in Adani created so much noise, while US insurance companies such as Meta Life, Athene Life invested Rs 6,700 crore (USD 750 Mn) invested more than that (In June 2025). India has only a few groups that operate such large, national-scale infrastructure. Groups like Adani, Reliance, and Tata run: Transmission lines, Renewable Energy, Energy networks, Ports, Logistics Chains, Roads, Airports These assets usually have AAA or high safety ratings from rating agencies. For an insurer like LIC — which needs to think 20, 30, even 40 years ahead — such companies offer stability, security, and steady income. This is exactly why global insurers invest heavily in infrastructure. LIC is doing the same — following the same global best practices. A growing attempt to destabilise the Indian economy by creating systemic risk in the insurance sector. In contrast to large global insurers, many Indian insurers, not just LIC, but SBI Life, and ICICI Prudential, have significant exposure to the IT and banking sectors—industries highly vulnerable to technological disruption and geopolitical shocks. Recent events, such as the US USD 100,000 visa rule, sent immediate tremors through India’s IT sector. Looking ahead, innovations like AI could replace large portions of IT services, affecting companies like TCS, Infosys, and Wipro. The critical question is: if a major natural disaster, pandemic, or economic shock occurs in 2040, will insurers heavily exposed to volatile sectors be able to meet their obligations and pay claims? This underscores the strategic importance of long-term, stable infrastructure investments, which safeguard both policyholders and the broader economy. So the question is not “Why LIC invested here?” The real question is “Why should LIC not invest here, when every global insurer does?” LIC has always protected policyholders — since 1956 Even during earlier periods when LIC had exposure to troubled companies, LIC never defaulted or failed its customers. LIC under the UPA government took a big hit on investments as it made big investments in Mallya companies, DLF, GVK, Gitanjali Gems, Vakrangee etc—but no such cases in the past ten years. Since 2014, there has not been a single major investment failure of the kind seen earlier. As mentioned previously LIC’s equity portfolio has 10-folded from Rs 1.5 lakh crore to Rs 15.5 lakh crore. Investments in companies such as Adani, Tatas and Reliance is a major reason. Disclaimer: NDTV Profit is a subsidiary of AMG Media Networks Limited, an Adani Group Company.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Cyber Monday is here, and there are lots of deals to choose from, including these excellent discounts on the Apple products we recommend: Today’s best Apple deals: U.S. Today’s best Apple deals: U.K. Updated December 1: We have reviewed the best prices and found more price drops and changes. We will be regularly monitoring the best prices and will update this article throughout Cyber Monday. ‘Tis the season for savings! Whether you’re looking for a deal on an iPad, Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods, or anything else Apple sells, there’s no better time to get one for cheap than Black Friday. The annual shopping extravaganza officially kicked off on Friday, but many of the best deals will last until today, AKA Cyber Monday on December 1. Every retailer that sells Apple gear gets in on the fun, and we are rounding up only the best deals we find right here. We regularly check prices using various tools to get a view of the very best prices right now, compared to what they were over the past days, weeks, and months, so we know an excellent deal when we see it. We’re checking and updating these prices all weekend, so mark this page and return often so you don’t miss a good deal, some of which are short-lived. Even Apple runs its own Black Friday shopping event, where it offers gift cards on certain purchases, including $50 with AirPods Pro 3, $100 for iPad Air, and $250 with a MacBook Pro. The bottom line is that there are lots of deals to be found right now, so no matter what Apple device you’re looking for, you will be able to make a saving. So take a look at the deals on all of Apple’s products below. Also, check our Best Picks round-ups, where you can find reviews of all the products we recommend. At Macworld we’ve been covering and reviewing Apple and Apple devices for more than 40 years, from the original Macintosh to the most recent M5 MacBook Pro and iPhone 17 lineup. We use Apple products every day and purchase them with our own money, so we know a good deal when we see one. More importantly, we also know how to spot a bad deal. With a working knowledge of everything Apple sells and decades of experience, we know when stores are inflating prices or pushing “normal” sales as limited Black Friday deals, so the listings you see here will only be for discounts that are at or near all-time low prices. Macworld Cyber Monday tip: While shopping during the Black Friday sales, we’ve noticed that on Amazon, if you delay your delivery date, there are additional 2-3% savings to be had. This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart, then it can add up to decent savings. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than last Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $150 off it’s a good saving (but it was $200 earlier in the Black Friday sale). We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 did dip as low as $139 at Walmart, but that deal seems to have ended now, the next best option is $189 on Amazon. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 was superb, but stock seems to have run out now (check to see if the model is user). You can still get AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation for less than $100, which is an excellent deal. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that AirPods deals sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers can save money on the AirPods Pro 2, currently at £169 with Argos, but we’ve also seen them at that price on Amazon (but they go out of stock quickly!). Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’ve seen $150 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. The standard entry-level iPad A16 is an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $275, but stock is dwindling, so if you want one act fast. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) (which has run out now) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Cyber Monday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or £74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 off/£20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats. You might also find some deals among our best earbuds for iPhones and Best over-ear headphones. U.S. U.K. Apple holds a shopping event every Black Friday, but it doesn’t offer actual discounts. Instead, Apple gives away gift cards when you buy certain products, which can be used on a future purchase. In 2025, Apple is offering the following gift card values over Black Friday weekend: This years deal is better than last year’s, with a maximum of $250/£200 being given away in the form of gift vouchers, and in some cases, such as the iPhones, we are seeing better savings via Apple than elsewhere.

Rehires of people who were laid off could become more popular in a shaky job market. Visier, a people analytics firm, looked at how many people were rehired at their previous employers within 15 months of being terminated. Visier found about 5.3% of laid-off employees were rehired, based on global data from 2018 to 2024 covering 142 large organizations with over 2 million employee records. Andrea Derler, principal researcher at Visier, expects boomerang hires of people who were previously laid off to increase as companies figure out how to handle "AI-induced pressures" and economic uncertainty. "In times of extreme turmoil, where workforce planning is made even more difficult due to rapid, unexpected, and unpredictable changes, layoff boomerangs seem to be more prevalent," Derler said. Separately, ADP Research found that the share of new hires who were boomerang employees increased from 26% in March 2022 to 35% this past March. "In an era where the outlook on the jobs market is fuzzy or uncertain, it makes sense for both employers and employees to stick with what they know," Nela Richardson, ADP's chief economist, previously told Business Insider. The US is in a mostly frozen job market marked by low layoffs, but also low hiring. Job growth slowed from a monthly average of 111,000 between January and March to about 62,000 between July and September. Layoffs in the US are low, but announcements are adding up. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that there have been over 1 million job cuts announced from US-based employers this year as of October. Verizon, Amazon, government agencies, and others have made headlines for their decisions. Derler said Visier's data doesn't show a surge in manager layoffs, but they are also more likely to be rehired. "Organizations realize that it's really hard to find a good manager because the manager is responsible for a lot of things: performance, productivity, but also engagement of other employees," she said. Among the handful of industries Visier looked at, finance and retail had the highest rates of laid-off employees that were rehired at 7.5% each. Derler said retail has a lot of turnover, so it makes sense that workers may go back and forth. She suspects the rate for the finance industry is because the work duties involve certain skills and expertise. Instead of tapping into a new talent pool, businesses may turn to people previously on their payroll and who have already demonstrated their capabilities. Meanwhile, Derler said tech's rate of 4.3%, below the average rate and the lowest among the five industries looked at, could be because desired skills and knowledge quickly evolve. So, unlike finance, firms may want to look at a new talent pool. "Prompt engineers a year ago was the big job — nobody talks about prompt engineering anymore," Derler said. "Skills are changing so fast, so that's why I can assume that they'll be looking for new people with new skills rather than those who they know." Derler said all parties need to have good "layoff hygiene," where both sides are respectful. She said workers should also try not to internalize their layoff or think it's something they did wrong. She also emphasized the importance of always keeping up your skills, so that if you are laid off, you can confidently add your knowledge to your résumé or talk about it in an interview. Derler also suggested staying connected with people you worked well with in case you do rejoin — not just so it's pleasant to return, but because they might know about an opening. Derler said she interviewed some boomerangs and found some were still in touch with their old boss. "When their manager then realized they actually needed somebody again, they would be the first that they would call," she said. "Makes sense, right? Because you know the person, you get on well with them." Have you gone back to your previous job? Are you a hiring manager who has made boomerang hires?

Share this article BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw approximately $114 million in net inflows on November 28 amid ongoing crypto market volatility. The substantial outflow comes as many investors continue reducing their digital asset exposure. The selloff reflects investor sentiment across US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have experienced notable outflows in recent weeks. BlackRock has observed clients pulling back from Bitcoin positions during the current crypto market downturn. In recent weeks, major funds have reported significant Bitcoin sell-offs as the crypto market faces heightened volatility. The trend aligns with institutional investors’ broader strategy of reducing exposure to digital assets during periods of market uncertainty. Despite outflows from IBIT, US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs still finished Friday in the green, buoyed by fresh inflows into funds run by Fidelity, ARK Invest, and Grayscale. The group collectively pulled in around $71 million. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account? Create one Create your account Already have an account? Sign In Forgot your password? Sign In

Title: Want to work from home? Here's how 7 people got their managers on board — or secured flexibility themselves

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After months of battling LA traffic, Leslie Snipes decided it was time to talk to her manager. For the first few months of her job as a director of marketing at a Los Angeles-based creative agency, she drove 60 to 90 minutes to the office a few days a week — but the commute eventually began to take a toll. "I was wasting hours just sitting in traffic," said the 34-year-old. In April of last year, Snipes decided to ask her manager whether she could work remotely almost exclusively. She explained that she'd be more productive working from home and that her team's strongest bonding often happened during business trips and off-site projects. Snipes said she received verbal approval in less than a day — and that she now typically works from the office once or twice a month to "show face" and connect with colleagues. "I feel less stressed, since I'm not spending hours sitting in traffic," she said. "It's a setup I wouldn't have unless I asked." While some workers are more than happy to return to the office for camaraderie and a change of scenery, Business Insider spoke to seven people who have found ways to secure flexible work arrangements — whether or not they're officially sanctioned. Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who studies remote work, said work-from-home rates have remained fairly stable in recent years, despite companies' implementing stricter return-to-office mandates. He believes that's offset by other employers — many of them smaller companies and startups — offering more flexibility. He also hypothesizes that employees are securing exceptions that allow them to work from home more frequently than their company's official policy permits. Bloom pointed out a possible motivating factor for allowing these exceptions: Managers are generally judged on how their teams perform, and they don't want to risk their best talent quitting or becoming less productive if they're forced back to the office. For this reason, some managers may choose not to enforce office attendance policies too strictly. "Managers ultimately care about their team performance," he said. Business Insider has spoken with dozens of workers about how they've responded to corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and return-to-office mandates.

Read more on the topic: Childcare responsibilities are a common factor pushing workers to secure work-from-home flexibility. In November 2024, Georg Loewen began working as a senior director of digital marketing at a public relations agency with a three-day-a-week in-office policy, which required him to make a roughly one-hour commute from New Jersey to Manhattan. But that commute proved challenging. Loewen was responsible for dropping off his one-year-old daughter at day care most mornings, and the 8 a.m. drop-off often made it difficult to catch the ideal 8:20 train that would get him to the office just before 9 — the next one wouldn't get him in until after 10. Even when he was on time, finding a parking spot at the station wasn't guaranteed. Early this year, Loewen's manager initiated a conversation about his challenges getting into the office. Eventually, they came to an agreement. "If drop-off ran long or parking didn't work out, I'd just work from home," said the 34-year-old. Loewen said he typically works from the office once or twice a week. His current routine involves dropping off his daughter, heading home to park his car, and then riding a foldable bike 1.5 miles to the station, which allows him to avoid the hassle of finding a parking spot. He said he sometimes worries about how his arrangement might be perceived by coworkers who don't have the same flexibility, but added that he's consistently felt supported. He may need to work from the office more frequently as his team grows, he said, but for now, he's grateful for the leeway he's been given. A Wisconsin-based mother of three is similarly thankful for the flexible understanding she came to with her manager. In 2023, she'd considered leaving her corporate manufacturing role after the company announced a five-day-a-week office policy. She worried she couldn't meet her childcare responsibilities with a two-hour round-trip commute. Instead, she had an "off the record" conversation with her manager about how much remote work she could get away with. She said they told her to "be here as much as you can." As long as she was in the office a few days a week — especially on days with key in-person meetings — they wouldn't stand in her way. "If I need to work from home for whatever reason, whether it's work or personal reasons, then that's OK," she said. Some workers have found creative ways to spend less time at the office. When Elysa Ellis began looking for a new role last year, she was hesitant to give up the remote work flexibility she'd grown used to. After landing an interview with a local nonprofit that required employees to work from the office five days a week, she came with a prepared request: a 9-to-3 schedule, instead of the typical 9-to-5. Ellis said it was important for her to be able to pick up her two children from school around 3 p.m. and spend time with them until her husband finished work. "My children are young, so I knew that stepping into an in-office role would impact them a lot," she said, adding, "I felt like I had nothing to lose." By the time Ellis was offered the job, her request had been granted. She would work from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. — and still receive her full salary. In 2022, when a millennial IT professional heard rumors that his employer might implement a stricter return-to-office policy, he began searching for a new role. Shortly after, he landed an offer for a remote position similar to his current role. However, he was hesitant to resign while his company's official policy still allowed remote work, so he decided to secretly juggle both roles — earning $250,000 annually, roughly double his previous income. And if his initial employer ever adopted a stricter in-office policy, he figured he had a backup plan. "I ultimately decided to try it since I could easily just drop one if it was too much," he said. For a millennial finance manager at Amazon, maximizing his work-from-home time meant doing the bare minimum at the office. When Amazon announced in 2023 that it would require corporate employees to work from the office three days a week, he began going in the required number of days — but only worked between nine and 12 hours total across all three days. He said it was feasible because he was the only member of his team based at that office. "I would go into the office for a few hours, avoid rush hour, and fulfill my badging requirement," he said. For some, the simplest way to secure work-from-home flexibility is to find a job that offers it from day one. After being laid off from a remote job, a New Jersey-based e-commerce professional landed an offer last year for a role at JPMorgan — one that would require him to commute to a Manhattan office three days a week. As he considered the offer, he estimated that commuting would take nine hours a week and cost him more than $7,000 a year. Around the same time, he received another offer — this one for a remote role with a salary about $5,000 lower than the JPMorgan position. When he compared the two jobs in terms of what he'd earn for every hour he'd have to "invest" in them — factoring in both commuting time and related costs — he said the decision was easy. "JPMorgan just could not compete," he said, adding: "A 40-hour week plus nine commute hours is basically a 50-hour week for the salary that they were offering." Jump to

Title: Analysis: OpenAI is a loss-making machine, with estimates that it has no road to profitability by 2030 — and will need a further $207 billion in funding even if it gets there

Don't call it a bubble! Loss-making monster OpenAI is on the hook for $1.4 trillion (with a T) in compute commitments, as companies start turning to debt to fund the AI craze.

Make sure to set Windows Central as a preferred source in Google Search, and find out why you should so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more. Don't call it a bubble, friends! You can't move five pixels on the internet without being hit with something AI related these days (my apologies for contributing there). Whether it's bad memes on your Instagram feed or AI-powered bots flooding X, or even nation states turning to AI to write government policy — AI has become the tech craze du jour and will likely remain that way for the foreseeable. Microsoft has bet heavily on OpenAI to fuel its own AI efforts, spearheaded by Microsoft Copilot. So far, Copilot has been something of a dud for any serious real-world use case, requiring constant human intervention to fact check and correct errors. Much the same is true for Google Gemini, Grok, and other artificial intelligence platforms, which so far seem to have found a niche as expensive meme creation tools — nowhere near providing the promised productivity boost. That isn't stopping the speculation, though. The assumption is that one day large language models (LLMs) and other related AI technologies fostered by Google Gemini and OpenAI ChatGPT actually will be a great and infallible productivity tool for genuine work. It already is decent for providing basic overviews of highly-covered, well-sourced topics, even as hallucinations and sycophancy continue to dog the tech, particularly in situations where accountability is more critical. Despite today's downsides, many companies are salivating at the idea of cheap virtual humans replacing real humans who need money to eat and time to sleep. Big Tech is racing to meet this possibility with panicked fervour, and recent analyses from FT and HSBC (via Fortune) suggest that things are potentially getting a bit ... irrational. Recent data shows that companies are increasingly relying on debt, rather than real revenue and cashflow to fund commitments to OpenAI and vice-versa. OpenAI has made a truly staggering $1.4 trillion (with a T) in commitments for compute to meet its projected needs, despite posting a "paltry" $20 billion in revenues this annum. To put it into context, $20 billion represents just 1.43~% of that $1.4 trillion commitment. It's a truly insane gap. OpenAI is exploring a range of revenue-generating initiatives to change its fortunes, including in-line ads within ChatGPT. Although a lot of it revolves around replacing human workers with AI, particularly in hospitality and customer service sectors. It would be theoretically far cheaper for very large companies to replace their human workers with ChatGPT, even if those contracts cost millions. That is, if it can provide customers with a satisfactory experience. Gartner previously projected that many companies turning to AI to replace workers are already reversing course. But I digress. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. HSBC projects that even if OpenAI is making $200 billion by 2030, it would still need a staggering $207 billion in funding to stay afloat. As OpenAI scales, so does its costs. Its expensive frontier models like Sora 2 and GPT-5 cost millions of dollars a day to run, requiring enormous amounts of compute. These models are given away at cost in attempts to drive adoption, create lock-in, and essentially alter human behavior. You can think of it similarly to Spotify, which spent well over a decade completely unprofitable until it had basically re-written the way humans consume music and how labels distribute music. OpenAI is trying to achieve a similar result on a far, far larger, and potentially far more damaging scale. Spotify collapsing wouldn't have had any impact on the global economy. But, if we get to a point where it seems the economics of "AI" and LLMs simply don't work — it could have a similar impact on markets to the dot com bubble or the credit crunch. There's simply so much invested in these companies and initiatives right now, that inability to service the debt would trigger a wave of instability. Whether it's power constraints, model inbreeding damaging long-term viability of data quality, or simply because it actually sucks and is nothing more than a novelty — it could be the case that AI is simply not destined to make real money. This is one reason why Microsoft has been focusing on efficiency and low-power consumption in its home-grown MAI models. Microsoft has focused its efforts on the constraints of global compute and energy markets as the tech's biggest bottleneck. But, like others, it's betting the bulk of its AI future on OpenAI, and that bet is exactly that. A gamble. The fragility of this whole ecosystem is increasingly coming to light. FT reports that of the $1.4 trillion compute commitments OpenAI has made, its partners are actually turning to debt themselves to meet those demands. Softbank, Oracle, CoreWeave, Blue Owl Capital, Crusoe, Vantage, and other venture capital firms and cloud providers have taken on a staggering $96 billion in debt in 2025 to give OpenAI the compute it's asking for. OpenAI is reportedly on the hook to meet these commitments whether or not demand materializes, too. The commitments are spread across the next eight years, and could trigger a cash flow crisis if OpenAI fails to find the funding to pay up. HSBC's most optimistic estimates suggest that OpenAI will hit 3 billion weekly active users by 2030, with 300 million of those paying a subscription. Even with this scale, Microsoft and other OpenAI partners could be on the hook to plough hundreds of billions more into OpenAI to keep it cash flow positive. OpenAI recently restructured its deal with Microsoft to that end, to help it find other sources of revenue and compute. Some of this analysis likely excludes fresh constraints, too, like the DRAM price crisis AI has triggered. Compute is going to get more expensive, not less expensive, with wafer and silicon capacity fully constrained. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently explained how the company is leaving compute on the literal shelf because it physically can't source the electricity it needs to meet demand. Will Microsoft et al. need to become energy suppliers on top of server companies? There's also no guarantee that energy costs in general will remain stable either, as global politics and climate change also continue to play a role. OpenAI and other AI companies have been lobbying to make LLMs a matter of national security to that end, seeking full-blown government backing and guarantees. The delicate balance of debt and speculation threatens to wipe out billions if connected companies default and become insolvent, which will drive a wave of corrections hitting the biggest players like NVIDIA and Microsoft. All of this falls apart if humans don't adopt the tech. This is why you've seen Meta cram its lame chatbots into WhatsApp and Instagram. This is why Notepad and Paint now have useless Copilot buttons on Windows. This is why Google Gemini wants to "help you" read and reply to your emails. They're trying to change our habits, because all of the projections rely on people becoming truly dependent on the technology. Whether or not it's actually a good thing for society isn't considered to be a factor. They're forcing it on us because if we don't use it, if we don't subscribe to it, buy products through it, or click on ads through it — the debt structure will inevitably implode. It will wipe out billions in unpaid loans. And as usual, the banks will be bailed out, and the tax payer will have to foot the bill. Higher costs, decreased employment opportunities, higher interest rates, and likely another round of sticky inflation. But hey, I'm sure all the big players will have cashed out their stocks way before any of that happens. In reality, LLM technology is here to stay, but the constraints are becoming untenable. The efficacy and efficiency of the models at hyperscales has become the real bottleneck. Electricity and water requirements are impacting tax payers. Crucially, will people ever want to pay for this stuff? It's not ideal that OpenAI's success may depend on big companies using it to replace human workers at huge scales. How will people pay for OpenAI if nobody has a job? Where will OpenAI get its training data if the human-led information economy falls apart? The business model seems like a bit of a negative feedback loop, at least on the face of it. Costs will have to come down rapidly in my view for any of this to actually work. It probably won't be LLM research alone that fuels the next wave of innovation as a result, but energy and server technology breakthroughs. But that's an exploration for another article. Will OpenAI and others hit the profitability before the debt bubble bursts? It'll be interesting to see what the next five years brings.

Title: BlackRock shifts 4,044 BTC and 80,121 ETH – But it’s NOT fresh buying!

ETF redemptions moved $354M BTC and $235M ETH, signaling capital exiting rather than fresh buying. The crypto market remains in a tense holding pattern, with Bitcoin struggling to stay above the key $91,000 level. This persistent volatility often signals weakness, suggesting bulls are finding it difficult to gain control. However, the moves by Wall Street’s largest players stand in sharp contrast to these concerns. Reports show BlackRock moved a massive $589 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum, with Arkham data confirming it received $354 million in BTC and $235 million in ETH from Coinbase. At first, this seems like a major accumulation, but it actually reflects a deeper structural shift. Despite Bitcoin [BTC] trading near $90,898 and Ethereum [ETH] remaining above $3,000, at press time, these inflows into BlackRock’s wallets are not new purchases. Many assume this activity is triggering a market “flush,” but that misses the real story. The current volatility isn’t a sign of weakness; it’s part of crypto’s transition into a more mature, institutional system. The transfers reveal how ETF redemptions work and highlight the widening gap between what on-chain data shows and what’s actually happening in the market. Under the cash creation process, market makers manage ETF withdrawals by repurchasing ETF shares and selling an equivalent amount of Bitcoin or Ethereum to remain hedged. Once this sale is complete, they redeem the ETF shares with BlackRock and receive the actual BTC or ETH. This step triggers large on-chain transfers from Coinbase Prime to their wallets. In the past three days alone, these redemptions have moved 4,044 BTC worth $354 million and 80,121 ETH worth $235 million on-chain. Importantly, these transfers do not represent new buying activity. Instead, they mark the final handoff of crypto following earlier sell pressure from investor exits. In short, this reflects capital leaving the ETF system rather than entering it. Overall, BlackRock’s strategy highlights a sharp divide between speculative enthusiasm and institutional discipline. By dismissing most altcoins as “worthless” and concentrating solely on Bitcoin and Ethereum, the firm is anchoring itself to assets it views as durable, liquid, and more likely to meet regulatory standards Combined, all these factors point to the fact that the future of institutional crypto will be built on select assets and scalable financial infrastructure and not on chasing the ever-expanding altcoin universe.

Title: Binance, Polymarket lead as VCs deploy $25bn into crypto companies

About us Copy link Investors have deployed nearly $25 billion into crypto companies in 2025, dwarfing last year’s by over 150% and blowing past market watchers’ expectations. Top guns involved in dealmaking this year include tech-focused firms Paradigm and Sequoia Capital, as well as Wall Street juggernauts BlackRock, JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs. The most popular sectors? Centralised exchanges with $4.4 billion, prediction markets with $3.2 billion, and DeFi platforms with $2.9 billion, according to data from DefiLlama. “The projects attracting capital today are those aligned with regulatory clarity, operational resilience, and the ability to integrate with TradFi institutions and their standards,” Jordan Knecht, head of institutional strategies at GlobalStake, the blockchain services firm, told DL News. “In the middle of a choppy market, investors are signalling that they prefer durable, compliance-first businesses that aim to establish a long-term foundation for this asset class,” Knecht said. Knecht isn’t alone to note that the crypto market has evolved this year. Charles Chong, VP of strategy at crypto-native advisory firm BlockSpaceForce, told DL News that “the environment for crypto startups is shifting.” Chong said that capital is rotating toward mature players whose revenue and unit economics justify valuation. “None of this signals weakness; it simply reflects a market that is normalising and maturing,” he said, adding that raises are “becoming more rational, more aligned with fundamentals, and less driven by reflexive speculation.” Georgii Verbitskii, angel investor and founder of the crypto investment firm TYMIO, told DL News that crypto is closely following the same pattern as other market cycles. “In every major technology cycle, capital first flows into the base layer — the rails, liquidity, and settlement systems — before it moves into consumer-facing applications,” he said. Here are some of the most notable raises this year. Binance, said to be the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume, secured a massive raise of $2 billion in March. This significant capital injection was led by Abu Dhabi-based artificial intelligence and advanced technology investor MGX. Binance CEO Richard Teng said that “this investment by MGX is a significant milestone for the crypto industry and for Binance. Betting platform Polymarket closed a major funding round worth $2 billion in October, led by Intercontinental Exchange, valuing it around $8 billion. Once a fringe crypto‑betting site, the capital infusion reflects high institutional confidence. Circle Internet Group, the issuer of the $76 billion stablecoin USDC, raised $1.1 billion in its June initial public offering. The blockbuster IPO was led by JP Morgan, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs serving as joint lead bookrunners, joined by Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and Société Générale as bookrunners. Founded in 2013, Circle has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the United States’ warming to the crypto industry.

Title: Brad Lander’s last (we hope) lunacy: a ‘climate’ hissy fit

Heading out of office on a characteristically pathetic note, city Comptroller Brad Lander mounted his high horse to demand city pension funds burn money on a symbolic stand against clmate change. Fund officials must cut ties with BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and PanAgora Asset Management, he preached — because those firms have stopped bowing to the anti-carbon hysteria. “Climate risk is financial risk,” Lander emoted. “You can see it all around you in an increased number of flash floods and wildfires.” Never mind that actual science doesn’t show such impacts from global warming, nor do major companies fail to account for all manner of genuine downside risks in their earnings forecasts: Loons like Lander want the financial world to pretend that every firm that isn’t (wrongly) assuming a climate catastrophe is coming isn’t worth investing in. BlackRock rightly slammed Lander’s hissy fit as “another instance of the politicization of public pension funds, which undermines the retirement security of hardworking New Yorkers.” Lander’s insistence on performative virtue-signaling, instead of acting in the best interest of 800,000 current and former city workers (and the taxpayers who ultimately guarantee public pensions) is another reason to cheer his departure from the city payroll. Subscribe to our daily Post Opinion newsletter! Please provide a valid email. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. The simply truth is that “decarbonizing” pension funds won’t do a darned thing to save the planet, but only reduce the returns on the funds’ investments. An honest comptroller wouldn’t strive to waste public monies on ideological hobby horses. Cross your fingers that Lander’s Dec 31 exit from the comptroller’s office will mark the end of his disgraceful political career. And pray that Democratic voters don’t entertain this preposterous fraud’s expected challenge to Rep. Dan Goldman in next June’s primary: Make Brad finally have to earn a living in the private sector.

Title: The Best Black Friday 2025 VR Headset Discounts & Deals

Time Published: 2025-11-28T22:05:25Z

Considering jumping into VR this Black Friday, or gifting a headset to a friend or relative so they can join you? Here are the best deals available. Meta Quest headsets are the ideal way to get into VR and mixed reality for most people. They are fully standalone, meaning you don't need any external device (other than a phone app to initially set them up), and they can also wirelessly connect to SteamVR on a gaming PC, if you have one, for a higher fidelity experience. There are currently two headsets in Meta's lineup, the budget Quest 3S and the higher-end Quest 3. Quest 3S is normally $300, while Quest 3 is normally $500. The excellent Black Friday 2025 deals for Quest 3S offer both a lower price and added perks, making it an ideal holiday gift, while there's only one Quest 3 deal we're aware of, and it only offers a perk. Still, if you have the funds, we always recommend the proper Quest 3. While Quest 3S reuses the old fresnel lenses from Quest 2, Quest 3 features Meta's advanced pancake lenses which are clearer and sharper over a wider area, have a wider field of view, and have precise separation adjustment, making them suitable for essentially everyone's eyes. These pancake lenses also enable Quest 3 to be thinner, which makes the headset feel slightly less heavy. Best Buy is offering a $75 gift card and 1 month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with Quest 3 purchases. You could, for example, use the Best Buy gift card to get a rigid strap and softer facial interface – upgrades which can make the headset feel more comfortable to wear. During the 1 month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (normally $30) you can play flatscreen games like Call of Duty on a giant virtual screen. And you still get the 3 months of the Meta Horizon+ subscription, as with all purchases of new Meta headsets. If you're a Costco member, you can get Quest 3S for $200, and if you're not, you can get it for $215. That's $85-$100 off the regular price. In both cases, Costco's deal comes with 12 months of Horizon+, compared to the 3 months you normally get with a new Meta headset. Horizon+ includes a Games Catalog with some of Quest's best VR games, including Asgard's Wrath 2, Cubism, Demeo, Dungeons of Eternity, Eleven Table Tennis, Ghosts of Tabor, Job Simulator, Maestro, Onward, Pistol Whip, Red Matter, Synth Riders, The Climb 2, and Walkabout Mini Golf. It also lets subscribers redeem 2 monthly games pre-selected by Meta. The Costco deal lasts through December 2, the coming Tuesday, so make sure to grab it soon if you want to affordably bring a friend or relative into VR. Quest 3S is $250 at Best Buy, and the retailer is offering a $50 Best Buy gift card, 1 month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners VR game. That's a $50 discount from the headset's regular $300 price, and the three perks together are worth $110. You can find the deal for the 128GB base model of Quest 3S here. A similar offer is available for the 256GB storage model, with a $330 price ($70 off) and the same perks. You still get 3 months of the Meta Horizon+ subscription, as with all purchases of new Meta headsets. You could use the $50 Best Buy gift card to get the Elite Strap to make the headset more comfortable for just $20, for example, while during the 1 month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (normally $30) you can play popular flatscreen games like Call of Duty on a giant virtual screen. As for The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners, it's also normally $30, and it's widely considered to be one of the best VR games of all time due to its physics-based combat system, earning an 'Essential' score in our review. PlayStation VR2 is $300 at all official retailers until December 19, its lowest price ever. PlayStation VR2 is not a standalone headset, and it has a cable which needs to be connected to a host device. It connects to the PS5 or PS5 Pro console out of the box, and can alternatively connect to a gaming PC with the sold-separately PC adapter. This price applies to both the regular SKU and the bundle with Horizon Call of the Mountain, so you should always grab the latter if it's in stock. At this discounted price, PlayStation VR2 is an ideal option for a PS5 owner heavily invested in the PlayStation ecosystem, or, with the adapter, a PC owner interested in sim racing, flight sim, or other seated games. The PS VR2 discount is available for another three weeks, so there should be plenty of time to grab one in time for Christmas. Pico 4 Ultra is a Quest 3 competitor from ByteDance, the Chinese tech giant behind TikTok. It isn't sold in North America, so if you're in the US or Canada you can ignore its existence. For those who are in a region where Pico 4 Ultra is sold, the Black Friday 2025 deal prices it at €400, and comes with 2 VR games and a season pass for Premier League Player. Those 2 VR games are Pistol Whip and Blade & Sorcery: Nomad, widely considered to be among the best VR games of all time. The headset is normally priced at €600, so this is a massive €200 discount. And the 2 VR games and season pass are worth €100 together, meaning the total extra value here is €300. Pico 4 Ultra holds up relatively well to Quest 3, but while the Pico Store has a decent chunk of the content available on Quest 3, it still lacks many of the games you'll find on Meta's platform, particularly the blockbuster exclusives. However, ByteDance has a unique offering which Meta has ruled out making an equivalent of: Pico Motion Trackers. They're lightweight wireless pucks that you can strap to yourself to add various levels of body tracking in supported titles. For Black Friday get a pair for €70 to strap to your ankles to add leg tracking. Then, you can add the 'Waist Version' for €40 to improve the quality of body tracking and get a true orientation for your waist. And if you want to go even further, you can now get a second €70 pair for your upper leg or forearms, improving leg or arm tracking, for a total of 5 trackers. Supported titles for Pico Motion Trackers include VRChat (both standalone and via wireless PC VR) and Blade & Sorcery: Nomad. Get a weekly summary of the most important VR and AR news.

Title: Bitcoin Maxi Says ATH Back On The Table After 40x Derivatives Surge

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin may be closing in on a new all-time high after moves in the derivatives market and fresh buying from large holders, according to market watchers and on-chain data. Max Keiser, a long-time Bitcoin advocate, pointed to a filing by Nasdaq to increase options limits for BlackRock’s IBIT to 1 million contracts — a jump that represents roughly a 40x expansion from prior levels — as a key development that could remove barriers to bigger institutional flows. According to Nasdaq paperwork and public commentary, the previous 25,000 contract cap had been seen by some as too small for rising volume. Market experts argued that earlier limits were “discriminatorily small” and suggested that 400,000 contracts would be a more reasonable baseline given current demand. Some described the change as a move that could place IBIT into a mega-cap derivatives category, unlocking follow-on effects for how banks and funds structure exposure to bitcoin. I first explained this in 2017: Now that BTC derivatives market was just expanded by 40x New ATH’s are in play. **November 2, 2017** Max Keiser first discussed Bitcoin market makers needing to expand their inventory to support higher prices in this X post: “Wall St traders… https://t.co/aBQ5DdSDay — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) November 27, 2025 Market makers will be able to hedge larger positions without hitting the old size wall, which can lower spreads and deepen available liquidity. Based on reports, that also means banks can build structured notes that use IBIT as a reference without tripping existing risk caps — and JPMorgan is reportedly preparing Bitcoin-backed structured notes that would track BlackRock IBIT. Those products could channel steady, institutional flows into the market rather than one-off spikes. According to Glassnode’s Accumulation Trend Score by cohort, holders of 10,000 BTC or more have flipped to net accumulation and now show a score of 0.8, signaling strong buying. The 1,000 to 10,000 BTC group has also turned positive for the first time since September, while the 100 to 1,000 BTC cohort has been in active accumulation since October and continued buying through recent declines. Even retail holders with less than 1 BTC are showing their strongest accumulation since July. Bitcoin’s price behavior supports the buying narrative. The token fell into the low $80,000 area that served as support in May and then climbed back above $90,000 quickly, which many traders took as a sign that the market sees value in the $80,000 zone. Based on reports, the average cost basis for US spot bitcoin ETFs was near $82,000, and that figure has been cited as a reason institutions found the dip attractive. Keiser had warned previously that when size limits blocked hedging, the market would be prone to pullbacks — and some analysts say that is part of the reason for recent volatility. Expanding the options cap allows volume sellers to enter more smoothly, which could reduce erratic swings but will not erase market risk. Price spikes are still possible and downside moves remain a real threat if flows slow or macro conditions shift.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Clontarf host Terenure in a repeat of the memorable 2022 and 2023 Energia All-Ireland League (AIL) finals at Castle Avenue and in another significant meeting of third and second in Division 1A, with each on 23 points and one behind leaders St Mary’s. What was labelled the “new classico” at the height of their rivalry, this latest meeting could be called the “Jordan Coghlan derby” as the former Leinster, Munster, Leicester and Nottingham number eight faces Terenure, the club where he shone for the last four seasons before his summer wedding and relocation to his home club, Clontarf. Terenure recorded a 28-10 victory in the bullring last season before Clontarf completed a trademark comeback when Conor Kelly landed a last-ditch conversion in Lakelands Park in a pivotal win en route to regaining the title. Tarf have won five in a row while Terenure’s dramatic defeat of St Mary’s two weeks ago was their fourth in succession.

Carlos Spencer makes three changes for Nure, including Connacht centre John Devine. Max Russell reverts from flanker to hooker, with John McKee on Leinster duty, and Harrison Brewer reverts to the backrow. Lansdowne, in fourth on 20 points, host fifth-placed Ballynahinch, a point behind. Declan Fassbender makes five changes, among them Harry O’Riordan and Harry van Eeden replacing Leinster duo Charlie Tector and Max Deegan. Ulster outhalf James Humphreys and Marcus Rea are among Ballynahinch’s four changes. Leaders St Mary’s host bottom-placed Nenagh Ormond, with the Division 1A leading points scorer Mick O’Gara replacing Conor Dean at outhalf. Ninth-placed Old Belvedere host UCD in eighth at Ollie Campbell Park. Young Munster in seventh host Con, two points above them in sixth, at Tom Clifford Park in a match that is live on irishrugby+. The 1B leaders Old Wesley travel to Highfield, Garryowen host Trinity in a top four clash and Queen’s host Instonians in an eagerly awaited Belfast derby.

Title: Snapchat is nearing 1 billion monthly users. Why can’t it turn a profit?

Time Published: 2025-11-28T20:54:43Z

By Queenie Wong, Los Angeles Times Snapchat, an app whose disappearing messages and silly face filters made chatting with loved ones more casual, is close to a milestone that few social media platforms achieve: reaching 1 billion monthly users. But Snap, the Santa Monica company behind the app, faces a crucial test. The 14-year-old tech company is still losing money and has seen its share price tumble as it barrels forward to popularize augmented reality glasses next year. And even though more people in developing countries are using the app, Snapchat usage in markets where the company makes more revenue per user, including the United States and Europe, has dropped. Snapchat has 943 million monthly active users globally, according to the company. Growth in India, where TikTok is banned, and Pakistan have fueled Snapchat’s global user growth, data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower show. In India, Snapchat monthly users have surpassed 250 million, making up more than a quarter of its user base, according to numbers Snap released in July. At the same time, in the third quarter, Snapchat monthly active users declined by 4% in the U.S. and double digits in France, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom, Sensor Tower said. Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel wrote in a September note to employees the company is in a “crucible moment,” comparing it to a “middle child” wedged between larger tech giants and smaller rivals. “This moment isn’t just about survival,” Spiegel wrote in the note. “It’s about proving that a different way of building technology, one that deepens friendships and inspires creativity, can succeed in a world that often rewards the opposite.” The 35-year-old tech executive co-founded Snapchat — initially known as Picaboo — in 2011 with friends as part of a class project while attending Stanford University. Back then, texts and photos posted on social media such as Facebook and Instagram were more permanent. Snapchat’s logo is a ghost and the app distinguished itself from its competitors by giving people a way to share photos and messages that disappeared once someone viewed it. Instead of a social media app that opens to a feed of content, Snapchat opens to a camera. Rather than worry about whether they looked perfect, people leaned into quirky and creative ways to express themselves. They overlaid effects onto their selfies, transforming their faces into cute dogs and even puking rainbows. The app encouraged people to keep sending these disappearing messages known as “Snaps” to their loved ones at least once a day, keeping what’s known as a “streak” alive. As Snapchat’s popularity soared, fueling the rise of vertical videos, bigger social media rivals took notice. Snapchat’s co-founders turned down Facebook’s multibillion-dollar offer to buy the company. Facebook and its photo-sharing app Instagram copied Snapchat’s signature features including Stories, which allowed people to post images and videos that vanish after 24 hours. This prompted some Snapchat users to flock to its rival Instagram. Spiegel jokingly titled himself as the vice president of product at Meta, Facebook’s parent company, on LinkedIn, a nod to the social media giant’s cloning of Snapchat’s features. Although Snapchat set itself apart from other social media, it also faced similar concerns tech platforms grappled with such as child safety and mental health. The app is popular among teenagers, prompting some users to question if they’re too old for Snapchat and should leave. Investor confidence in the company has plummeted. In 2021, Snap’s stock peaked at more than $83 per share. Snap’s share price closed Tuesday at $7.64. Competing with larger rivals such as Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and TikTok, for ad dollars has been challenging for Snapchat and it has struggled to consistently turn a profit. Apple’s privacy feature made it tougher for advertisers to track users across apps and websites, posing an extra hurdle for social networks. Research firm eMarketer estimates that in 2025 Snapchat will claim 2.1% of U.S. social network ad spending, but said that share is dropping. Snapchat’s initial focus on disappearing messages made it tougher for the company to rope in advertisers because people typically don’t want to see ads in the middle of a private conversation. But the company has been updating its ad tools and expanded the places where ads are shown, including between short videos. Although Snapchat is popular among Gen Z and millennials, its audience might limit what businesses want to advertise on its platform. “It definitely skews a lot younger and that naturally sort of limits advertiser interests in its audience,” said Max Willens, a senior analyst at eMarketer. If a business wants to advertise retirement planning, for example, they would probably go to Facebook instead of Snapchat. On Snapchat, advertisers have also used augmented reality effects to promote their brands in quirky ways to a young audience. Snapchat users can transform themselves into a dancing McDonald’s McRib sandwich or snap selfies with digital animals from the Disney film “Zootopia 2.” Snap has been looking at other ways to make money. The company offers subscription plans so users can customize the app’s wallpaper, personalize their digital avatars known as Bitmojis and see how often their friends view their content. It started to limit the amount of free storage it offers to 5 gigabytes. AI company Perplexity said it will pay Snap $400 million over one year so users can find answers from its “AI-powered answer engine.” In the third quarter, Snap revenue reached $1.5 billion, up 10% compared with the same period last year. The company narrowed its net loss to $104 million, versus a net loss of $153 million during the year-earlier period. This month, JP Morgan analysts raised Snap’s price target to $8 after the Perplexity deal but kept an underweight rating on the shares, meaning they expect the stock to underperform. The firm said Snap has “a sizable market opportunity, an engaged user base, and a solid track record of innovation” but it’s also looking for “more consistent execution, improved user & revenue trends, & greater profitability.” Snap has made bold and expensive bets on the future of computing by releasing a drone and glasses to capture photos and videos — though those products flopped. Now Snap plans to release augmented reality glasses in 2026 that let people interact with digital images overlaid onto the physical world. Instead of taking out your phone, people will be able to review documents, stream movies, play chess and more through glasses. For now, analysts say it’s too early to tell if Snap’s bets will pay off or the company will end up in the social media graveyard like Myspace or Vine. “There’s nothing written down that says you just get to be around forever if you’re a social media platform,” Willens said. “Although almost all of those still kind of trudge along in some state or another.” ©2025 Los Angeles Times.

Could Intel be closer to scoring a deal with iPhone maker Apple? The chipmaker's shares surged Friday as an analyst added fuel to rumors that the iPhone maker could become a new customer for the chipmaker. Shares of Intel (INTC) popped over 10% during Friday's shortened trading session to lead gains on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. (Read Investopedia's daily markets coverage here.) The likelihood of Apple (AAPL) becoming a new customer for Intel "has recently improved significantly," TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, citing industry surveys, posted on X Friday, suggesting that Intel could start shipping Apple processors as soon as 2027. A deal with Apple could boost confidence in a turnaround for Intel, which still faces persistent worries about its ability to secure long-term commitments to its manufacturing business. Apple and Intel did not respond to Investopedia's requests for comment in time for publication. Shares of Intel have roughly doubled in value this year after a flurry of recent deals, including a partnership with AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA). Still, they remain well off their historical highs as the company is still working to convince investors regarding a sustainable turnaround in its business. One of those challenges continues to be securing new customers for its manufacturing operation. The deal with Nvidia did not include commitments to Intel's foundry, raising speculation about whether the relationship could expand later or if the lack of foundry commitments could point to troubles convincing customers. A deal with former Intel customer Apple could go a long way in helping assuage those concerns. Shares of Apple rose a bit less than 0.5% on Friday.

Title: The best Black Friday PC hardware deals: Graphics cards, SSDs, and accessories are down to record-low prices

It's Black Friday, and some of the top discounts you'll find are on PC hardware. As one of Business Insider Reviews' computing experts, I can tell you that if you've been waiting to upgrade your PC setup, now's the time, as manufacturers try to clear out all of their 2025 stock ahead of the new year. That means excellent Black Friday discounts on graphics cards, solid-state drives, monitors, and more. Some of the best Black Friday computer hardware deals I've found so far include $90 off a new Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 GPU from Asus, a 25% discount on a Nintendo Switch 2-compatible microSD Express card, and a Dell 4K monitor for an all-time low price of $200. I expect deals to come and go as the weekend progresses, so check back here often for updates. And if you're in the market for more than PC hardware, check out our main Black Friday deals page to find sales across tech, style, home, kitchen, and more. The extreme GPU shortage of the early 2020s is largely over, but graphics cards still command a high price. Luckily, GPUs tend to see big discounts on Black Friday. If you're building a new PC or upgrading an old one, consider investing in a new graphics card while these discounts are available. The GeForce RTX 5070 is one of Nvidia's newest graphics cards, offering sufficient power to maintain high framerates in even the most intensive games. This model from Asus uses its popular TUF components, which are built to withstand bumps, scratches, and heat. The RTX 5060 is Nvidia's entry-level card, but don't be fooled — any card in the RTX 50-series line is strong enough to ensure high-quality graphics in nearly any game. The "3X" in this model's name refers to its three built-in fans, which help keep the system cool while you're playing. AMD graphics cards aren't as popular as their Nvidia counterparts, but they're still a great choice for any gamer who wants a powerful (and affordable) GPU. This model comes from Sapphire, a manufacturer that specializes in AMD hardware. Solid-state drives come in three varieties: External, SATA, and NVMe. External drives, as the name implies, sit outside your computer and are portable, which is great for moving files from one system to another. SATA and NVMe drives, however, are installed inside your PC. They're both built for the same purpose, but NVMe drives are smaller and faster. Right now, I'm seeing good deals on External and NVMe SSDs, but not many on SATA options. Western Digital is a titan in the digital storage market, and this WD_Black SSD stick shows why. With a top read speed of nearly 15GB per second, it may be the fastest SSD on the market right now. This drive from Crucial offers ample storage and fast read speeds at a budget-friendly price. It's also compatible with a wide variety of gaming devices, including the PlayStation 5 and ROG Ally X. Advances in digital storage technology have made microSD cards more affordable than ever. That said, Black Friday is a great time to save even more on these tiny storage solutions — especially if you're a Nintendo Switch 2 owner who still needs to buy a new microSD Express card. Big things come in small packages — like this microSD card from Samsung, which comes with a whopping terabyte of storage. That's more space than most computers come equipped with, and it's enough to store thousands of photos. MicroSD Express is the newest standard for microSD cards, and it's also the only type of card that the Nintendo Switch 2 accepts. If you're looking for more space to store your games and screenshots, this 512GB Express card from Samsung is a great choice. It always seems like you run out of USB ports the moment you need them most. Luckily, it doesn't take much work to add more. All you need is a USB-C hub, which turns a single USB-C port on your computer into multiple USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, and Ethernet connections. And this Black Friday, I'm finding deals on hubs from every major brand. This USB-C hub from Baseus doesn't just look advanced — it also supports a wider range of devices than nearly any other hub on the market. This includes an Ethernet port, slots for both microSD and SD cards, two HDMI ports, and a wealth of USB ports. Anker has a hub for pretty much any situation. This model, which features HDMI, SD card, Ethernet, and USB ports, offers fast transfer speeds and weighs less than half a pound. UGreen has a lot of clout in the tech accessory world, and this 6-in-1 hub comes highly recommended. It offers HDMI and USB ports, along with fast charging speeds, for a budget price. Sometimes you don't need every type of port under the sun — especially if most of your devices use the same sort of plug. This Belkin hub features four USB-C ports with fast transfer speeds, perfect for Apple aficionados. When most people think of a keyboard and mouse, they probably picture a generic gray slab and blob. Nothing that's worth getting excited about. But modern mouse and keyboard combos are much more than that. I'm finding deals on mechanical keyboards, gaming mice, and even a status symbol among true typing maniacs: a split ergonomic keyboard. Mechanical keyboards, which offer a more tactile response than typical membrane boards, are all the rage these days. This model from Keychron is a great entry-level keyboard, offering clicky keys and a full number pad for a more affordable price than most mechanical boards. Corsair has a reputation for products that are both flashy and functional. This mechanical keyboard lets you give each key its own lighting, transmits inputs at lightning speed, and comes with a detachable soft palm rest. Split keyboards have been around for decades with proven health benefits, but it's only recently that they've really started to come into vogue. This critically acclaimed model can be placed up to 9" apart, laid flat or angled, and includes soft palm rests for extra comfort. Sometimes simpler is better, and this keyboard and mouse bundle from Amazon Basics is about as simple (and affordable) as you can get. The keyboard features full number and media control keys along the top row, and the mouse scrolls and swipes smoothly. You can have the strongest PC in the world, but it doesn't mean much if you don't have a great monitor to match. After all, no game is worth playing, and no movie is worth watching on a dull screen. Black Friday is one of the best times to score a deal on new monitors, and I've found discounts on monitors across a wide range of sizes and types. Curved monitors look cool, but finding a quality product tends to drain your wallet. The exception is this model from Sceptre, which offers nearly 25 inches of HD real estate. Combine that with the fast 240Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time, and you have a top-tier pick for any gaming setup, regardless of budget. 4K monitors aren't rare, but it's not easy to find one at this price. This 27-inch model from Dell features a wide color gamut and fast refresh rates — perfect for graphic design, gaming, and everything in between. You don't need a desktop PC to install a second monitor. This portable monitor is plug-and-play, meaning once you connect it to your laptop or console via USB-C or Mini HDMI, it'll start working right away. And once it's active, it'll dazzle with a high refresh rate and wide color range. Yes, Black Friday and its sister shopping holiday, Cyber Monday, are among the best times of year to buy computer products. Computers and PC accessories tend to drop to exceptionally low prices on Black Friday. This is especially true for products that receive new iterations every so often, like laptops and graphics cards, since manufacturers attempt to clear out their stock ahead of these new releases. It depends on what sort of product you're using, but generally, most accessories will work on both operating systems. Monitors, computer mice, and USB hubs are especially universal. Keyboards are a bit more complicated. Macs and PCs have slightly different keyboard layouts, so they usually require differently labeled boards. Luckily, keyboards with removable keys — such as mechanical boards — usually come with keycaps that match both operating systems, along with a switch to toggle between them. Graphics cards are a completely different story. Macs come with their own custom graphics cards, built directly into the central processor, and they can't be replaced or upgraded. So if you want to use an Nvidia RTX or AMD Radeon card, you'll need a PC, preferably a desktop. PC laptops also come with their own special GPUs. Branding doesn't always make sense. When it comes to PC hardware and accessories, "gaming" often tends to be a shorthand for "high quality." "Gaming" mice have more customization options; "gaming" keyboards feel better to type on; "gaming" monitors have more vivid colors and faster response times. Every graphics card is marketed primarily for gaming, even though graphic designers, animators, AI programmers, and other professionals also need them for their work. Why is this? There are probably a few reasons: First, that gamers have a reputation (deserved or not) for being tech-savvy, and thus more demanding of the products they buy; second, that PC gaming is already a high-cost hobby, and anyone willing to drop big bucks on a gaming PC can probably afford a high-quality setup to go with it; and third, to entice impressionable kids and teens who think that a product marketed for "gaming" is cooler than one marketed for checking email. All this is to say that products with "gaming" in the name aren't exclusively for gamers. A good gaming PC is also a good everyday PC, and this philosophy extends to accessories as well.

Google and Meta are creating new AI chips, adding competition. Some investors, like Michael Burry, are cautious about Nvidia’s price. Despite this, Nvidia’s earnings and cash flow remain strong.

Title: EU Set to Launch Full Antitrust Probe Into BlackRock–MSC Bid for Barcelona Port Terminal

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network Shipping containers are seen at the port of Barcelona, Spain, October 3, 2024. REUTERS/Nacho Doce By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS, Nov 27 (Reuters) – BlackRock and MSC’s bid for CK Hutchison’s terminal at Barcelona port faces a hurdle with EU antitrust regulators set to investigate the Spanish deal, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. The deal is separate from and predates BlackRock and MSC’s bid for most of CK Hutchison’s global port operations, Swiss-based MSC said. Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison separately wants to sell its 80% holding in the $22.8 billion ports business, which encompasses 43 ports in 23 countries, a politically sensitive deal that has been caught up in China-U.S. tensions. The likely full-scale investigation by the European Commission, previously unreported, could see regulators demand concessions from BlackRock and MSC in return for clearing the Spanish deal. The Commission declined to comment. BlackRock did not respond to several emailed requests for comment. CK Hutchison has interests in ports across Europe, including in Belgium, Poland and the Netherlands. It was not immediately clear if those other European parts of the global acquisition could also eventually come under scrutiny. The non-EU portions of the wider deal fall outside the EU’s review jurisdiction. BARCELONA TERMINAL ACQUISITION UNDER EU SCRUTINY The overall wider package, which includes two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal, has become highly politicized between Washington and Beijing. The Spanish deal would see Terminal Investment Limited Holding (TiL), a unit of Switzerland-based MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, and BlackRock acquire joint control of Hutchison’s terminal at Barcelona port. The terminal can serve multiple mega-ships simultaneously and has an eight-track rail facility – making it the EU’s largest rail terminal on the Mediterranean Sea – that connects the port with traffic to and from Southern Europe. TiL already operates a terminal at the Spanish port of Valencia. The European Commission, which acts as the EU competition enforcer, is set to open a full-scale investigation after its preliminary review of the deal ends on December 10, the person said. Full-scale EU investigations typically last around four months or longer and can lead to firms offering concessions including divestments to address competition concerns and secure regulatory approval.

Title: Michael Burry just started a massive group chat on Substack, and it's as chaotic as you'd expect

Every time Theron publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Michael Burry's group chat is going off. The investor of "The Big Short" fame invited all of his paid Substack subscribers to a group chat on Friday, and it quickly led to hundreds of replies ranging from memes to questions for Burry. This month, Burry pivoted from running a hedge fund to publishing a newsletter named "Cassandra Unchained." It has amassed more than 97,000 subscribers since it launched on Sunday. "This is a conversation space exclusively for paid subscribers—kind of like a group chat or live hangout," reads Burry's introductory post. "I plan to post updates that come my way, and you can jump into the discussion." The first reply on the chat reads: "I think Dr. Burry just broke Substack." Another early response jokes about Burry's disclosure this week that he owns bearish put options on Nvidia and Palantir stock: "I think Dr Burry is going to make more money from Substack than his NVDA and pltr puts 🤣" A third poked fun at a potential spike in traffic to Substack. "Someone pray for substacks backend engineers." "It's gonna be legendburry!!" one subscriber wrote, while another noted: "This chat is gonna be nuts." "Bro don't allow anyone to start threads. This a spam fest," one concerned poster added. Other subscribers rushed to post memes, videos, and even photos of Black Friday crowds. The questions to Burry ranged from who the next chair of the Federal Reserve might be, to how an 80-year-old should invest to prepare for a crash, to how the dollar stacks up against other currencies. Burry resurfaced on X in late October after more than two years of silence, and has wasted no time issuing numerous warnings of an AI bubble and taking aim at key players such as Nvidia and Palantir. The investor, who has 1.6 million X followers, is best known for predicting and profiting from the collapse of the US housing bubble that triggered a global financial crisis, and for issuing dire pronouncements of crashes and recessions. He became famous in financial circles after his bet against the subprime mortgage market was featured in author Michael Lewis' book "The Big Short," and actor Christian Bale played him in the movie adaptation.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang allegedly asks managers discouraging AI use: ‘Are you insane?’ — assures employees their jobs aren’t at risk because of AI

The Nvidia chief reportedly made the statement during an all-hands meeting after its record quarterly earnings. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang was allegedly recorded telling his people to use more AI while assuring them that they won’t get replaced by the tool. The head of the AI chip giant is reported to have said this during an all-hands meeting after its record-breaking quarter, which was leaked to Business Insider. The statements were reportedly made during the same meeting where he complained about the drop in Nvidia’s stock price despite performing absolutely well, with Huang saying that the market did not appreciate the company’s ‘incredible’ quarter. “My understanding is Nvidia has some managers who are telling their people to use less AI. Are you insane?” Huang reportedly said in the recording. “I want every task that is possible to be automated with artificial intelligence to be automated with artificial intelligence. I promise you; you will have work to do.” This push to use more AI tools has been happening across the industry, especially among massive tech companies like Meta and Microsoft. These two giants have been mandating their employees to use AI, with the use of such tools becoming a part of their evaluation. Business Insider also reports that Google has instructed its engineers to use AI for coding, while Amazon employees have requested the company to adopt AI coding tool Cursor. On the other hand, the widespread adoption of AI has made most employees wary of being replaced by machines. Even experts and industry leaders have been warning about this trend: Ford CEO Jim Farley said that it could wipe out half of white-collar jobs in the U.S., while Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that it could cause up to 20% unemployment in the next half-decade. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Oak Ridge National Laboratory study even created a labor simulation tool that estimates that up to 11.7% of workers are in danger of being replaced by AI. Nevertheless, Jensen Huang has reportedly reassured his employees that they are not in danger of being supplanted by this technology. Despite implementing the use of AI tools, Nvidia has continuously been hiring people, bringing in over 6,000 new faces in its last fiscal year. And amid the increasing tech industry layoffs, Huang says that the company probably needs about 10,000 more staff members. It makes sense for Huang and Nvidia to push their people into using AI. After all, it’s the reason that the once-gaming GPU maker has become the first company in the world to hit a $5-trillion market capitalization. But it’s just a tool that can enhance the productivity of employees, not something that should replace them entirely.

But it’s just a tool that can enhance the productivity of employees, not something that should replace them entirely.

Title: XRP Spot ETFs Behind The Scenes – Here’s What Institutions Aren’t Saying Publicly

Following the launch of the historic XRP Spot ETFs, the community has been buzzing with excitement, triggering notable success for the funds over the next few days. As the exchange funds continue to attract significant inflows, a crypto expert has outlined the development that is unfolding behind the initiative. The Spot XRP ETFs are seeing robust growth, but what is happening behind the scenes is quite interesting and demands attention. Pumpius, a crypto expert and investor, has uncovered a subtle play among institutions that is not being shared with the general crowd. According to the expert, ETF fund managers are legally forbidden from purchasing XRP directly from payment firm Ripple or escrow. This is due to the court’s injunction that every single ETF must acquire the altcoin on the open market only, breaking the concept of shortcuts, backdoor deals, and wholesale buying. Pumpius has declared this underlying trend at the institutional level to be the most bullish step for the altcoin. His reason hinges on the fact that Ripple will only release what is absolutely necessary from the monthly escrow holdings. Furthermore, the payment firm will avoid causing taxable events this way by keeping the escrow untouched. Such a move would imply that Ripple is drip-feeding just enough liquidity to avoid dislocation while ETFs are actively absorbing circulating supply. The expert considers this pattern the calm before a structural supply shock, and not a sign of stagnation. When the shift happens, it will be seen as a balancing act, a pressure build-up, and a loading phase. In the meantime, fund managers are already in discussion with Ripple, which means timing coordination is currently ongoing. At the same time, the expert has highlighted that supply dynamics are now being designed in real time. Once the early balance period concludes and ETF demand continues to rise while escrow is strictly regulated, XRP will not move at a slow pace. Instead, the expert predicts that the altcoin will experience substantial movement, breaking upside resistance levels with violence. Spot XRP ETFs have become a serious mode of investment in the landscape since their launch. Franklin Templeton recently stunned the market by introducing the Franklin XRP ETF on NYSE Arca and referring to the token as “fundamental to the global settlement system.” Other major firms such as Bitwise, Grayscale, and Canary Capital have all rolled out their own ETFs, which attracted millions in inflows from their first day. With the robust adoption and interest in the funds, the message is clear that the demand for regulated XRP exposure is bigger than anticipated. Despite the significant demand, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has yet to jump into the funds, stating that customer demand is still primarily centered on Bitcoin and Ethereum for now. Furthermore, they believe that regulatory clarity is still not entirely certain despite repeated victories over the US SEC. However, if the company eventually launches its own fund, it would spur billions of capital and new institutional money. Considering its status in the finance sector, “a BlackRock ETF would be the ultimate stamp of approval.” For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Uh-oh, accounting concerns circle the AI boom

UPDATED 10:53 EST / NOVEMBER 28 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof As investors start to care about returns from all the spending on artificial intelligence, accounting is becoming a big topic of concern. In his Breaking Analysis this week, Dave Vellante makes the case that GPUs have plenty of legs, quelling most concerns that lengthening depreciation times are a red flag. That said, Meta is particularly, shall we say, creative, when it comes to accounting for, or not accounting for, its multibillion-dollar spending on data centers. Sharpening the concern over AI’s payoff is that the current generative approaches may soon reach their limit, as another AI expert opined this week. Still, the AI we’ve got so far will pack quite a punch. As Paul Gillin writes in his latest feature, agentic AI soon will software like a tidal wave. Meantime, it was full speed ahead this week on new models and tools from Anthropic, Microsoft and OpenAI, along with other activity. After Jeff Bezos scraped up some change under his couch cushions to raise $6.2 billion for his secretive industrial AI “startup” Project Prometheus, it turns out he has already made an acquisition. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev also raised $120 million for Harmonic AI to eliminate hallucinations. And AI is still helping enterprise tech providers, though to varying degrees. Dell and NetApp cleaned up on earnings, but HP fell short and announced thousands of layoffs, and Nutanix didn’t do so great either. Amazon Web Services will hold its annual re:Invent confab next week, and I’m not revealing anything by saying it will be all about AI. Fair or not, Amazon has a bit to prove it can catch up in that realm to OpenAI — which some observers speculate it will announce a deal with — as well as partner Anthropic, Microsoft and a surging Google. But this week it announced it will invest $50 billion to expand AI and supercomputing capabilities for the U.S. government, so it’s hardly standing still. SiliconANGLE and theCUBE will be onsite at the event in Las Vegas with all the news, interviews and analysis. Next week there’s also a post-Thanksgiving glut of earnings from Salesforce, Snowflake, HPE, UiPath, CrowdStrike, Pure Storage and more that should provide further insight into the sustainability of the AI boom. Here’s all the enterprise and emerging tech news this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond: The end of apps? Imagining software’s agentic future Breaking Analysis: Resetting GPU depreciation: Why AI factories bend, but don’t break, useful life assumptions It’s worrisome when accounting becomes a central issue in tech business, but here’s a good analysis of why new depreciation assumptions are one of the biggest problems. AI meets aggressive accounting at Meta’s gigantic new data center (per the Wall Street Journal) This is pretty damning, especially coming from the reporter who first broke the iffy accounting at Enron back in 2000. Worth a careful read. “Artificial intelligence, meet artificial accounting.” Ouch! Ilya Sutskever declares the scaling era dead. His $3B bet says research will win Another AI pioneer weighs in, following Yann LeCun last week. Hmm. If scaling isn’t the key, who needs all those data centers? Jeff Bezos’ Project Prometheus reportedly acquires AI startup General Agents Harmonic AI raises $120M at $1.45B valuation to advance mathematical reasoning Financial AI startup Model ML nabs $75M investment Snowflake to acquire Select Star to expand Horizon Catalog’s view of enterprise data for next-gen AI Overstory closes $43M round to scale AI-driven wildfire prevention and grid resilience Cerrion raises $18M to support industrial automation with intelligent vision agents Momentic raises $15M to become the AI-era ‘source of truth’ for software quality Procure AI lands $13M in funding to automate business procurement tasks Kovant wants to become the nerve center of enterprise agentic AI operations after pre-seed funding Anthropic releases new flagship Claude Opus 4.5 model Microsoft debuts Fara-7B, a small ‘computer-use’ model that runs natively on PCs OpenAI debuts ChatGPT Shopping Research tool for personalized product discovery Amplitude lays out AI-native future as brands adapt to generative search SUSE’s MCP Server tech preview lays foundation for AI-assisted Linux infrastructure Arcade.dev and Anthropic advance MCP with new secure authorization flow Warner Music inks Suno deal amid cooling tensions over AI-generated music There’s even more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Amazon announces $50B investment to expand AI and supercomputing capabilities for US government Nvidia shares drop on report Meta may buy AI chips from Google Nuclear energy startup X-energy raises $700M in funding Dell’s stock rises on AI server demand, but HP slides after announcing layoffs and weak guidance NetApp raises its full-year earnings and revenue forecast and its stock rises Dismal revenue outlook crushes optimism around Nutanix and its stock tanks Workday falls in late trading as growth outlook fails to excite investors Zscaler reports strong quarter but cautious guidance weighs on shares Zoom tops estimates with stronger enterprise sales and higher AI adoption Autodesk earnings and revenue beat estimates, shares up 6% PagerDuty earnings surpass estimates but stock falls 5% Intel shares jump 10% on report of potential chip production deal with Apple Chip startup Rapidus reportedly plans to build 1.4-nanometer fab Kneron’s new AI chip brings LLM performance out of the cloud and onto devices Firefly AI says it can make apps almost invulnerable to cloud outages Mercy Ships, Presidio and Cisco partner at the intersection technology and purpose Google drops EU antitrust complaint against Microsoft amid cloud probe EU moves to ban social media for kids under 16 who don’t have parents’ consent We have lots more news on cloud, infrastructure and apps ServiceNow could reportedly acquire cybersecurity startup Veza for $1B+ Prominent tech executives back $36M round for cybersecurity startup Clover Security Opti lands $20M to automate enterprise identity governance with AI Agentic resiliency startup Vijil raises $17M to safeguard AI agents continuously Mixpanel breach compromises some OpenAI API users’ account data New ‘HashJack’ technique lets attackers manipulate AI assistants in Comet, Copilot and Gemini Oligo report uncovers critical Fluent Bit flaws exposing cloud workloads Amazon details internal ATA cybersecurity automation system Veeam makes the case for AI resilience Hack The Box debuts HTB AI Range to test AI and human cyber defense side by side Trend Micro previews security package for full-stack AI protection Superwise expands agentic governance platform with new real-time guardrails More cybersecurity news here Digital bank Klarna launches stablecoin amidst rising crypto adoption Paxos acquires crypto wallet startup Fordefi for $100M+ Gravis Robotics raises $23M to integrate AI into earthmoving equipment Execs say OpenAI has first hardware prototypes, plan to reveal device in two years or less And check out more news on emerging tech, blockchain and crypto and policy Network digital twin technology firm Forward Networks appointed Bobby Condon chief revenue officer.

Title: Amundi, Europe’s biggest asset manager, tokenises money market fund on Ethereum
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/amundi-europes-biggest-asset-manager-tokenises-money-market-fund-on-ethereum/
Time Published: 2025-11-28T15:01:44Z
Full Content:
European asset management giant Amundi has taken a major step into the digital finance era by launching the first tokenised share of its AMUNDI FUNDS CASH EUR money market fund on the Ethereum blockchain. The tokenised fund marks a significant innovation in fund distribution and allows investors to hold fund units digitally while maintaining the traditional channels for accessing the fund. According to Amundi, the tokenised fund is built in collaboration with CACEIS, one of Europe’s leading asset-servicing providers. CACEIS supplies the technology infrastructure required for tokenisation, including digital wallets for investors and a blockchain-based order platform that supports subscriptions and redemptions. Jean-Pierre Michalowski, CEO of CACEIS, highlighted that the hybrid transfer agent service opens a new distribution channel, allowing clients to quickly and efficiently execute fund transactions via blockchain while paving the way for potential future operations in stablecoins or central bank digital currencies. The first transaction of the tokenised share took place on November 4, 2025, and the fund is now distributed through a hybrid model. This means that investors can continue to use conventional methods, but the new digital option enables fund units to be recorded as tokens on Ethereum, providing secure, transparent, and traceable transaction records. Blockchain technology provides multiple advantages for both investors and fund managers. Orders can be executed instantly, operations can continue around the clock, and transactions are recorded with full transparency. The tokenised model also opens the fund to younger and more digitally oriented investors, reflecting a shift in investor behaviour toward faster, more accessible financial products. Amundi emphasised that the launch does not replace traditional fund access but instead provides an additional route for investors. The hybrid approach ensures that the fund remains inclusive, combining the reliability of conventional distribution with the efficiency and innovation offered by blockchain technology. Jean-Jacques Barbéris, Head of Institutional and Corporate Clients and ESG at Amundi, described asset tokenisation as a global transformation set to accelerate in the coming years, with this initiative serving as a practical demonstration of the firm’s expertise in implementing secure and robust blockchain applications in finance. The launch comes amid a broader expansion of tokenised real-world assets. Market data shows that the value of tokenised assets on blockchains rose sharply in 2025, from $15.2 billion at the beginning of the year to $37.1 billion by late November. Ethereum, where Amundi’s fund is hosted, ranks second globally in the tokenised real-world asset space with a market cap of $12.4 billion. The trend reflects increasing institutional interest in blockchain-based investment solutions and the mainstreaming of digital finance innovations. Tokenised money market funds, in particular, have seen rapid adoption in recent years. Industry data indicates that products from leading firms like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton now manage billions in digital assets, while total value locked in tokenised funds surged from around $770 million at the end of 2023 to nearly $9 billion by October 2025. Amundi’s launch positions it as a front-runner in Europe, showcasing its commitment to leveraging digital innovation while maintaining robust regulatory and operational standards.

Title: Biggest Black Friday 2025 Sales on Disney Stuff!
URL: https://www.disneytouristblog.com/biggest-black-friday-2025-sales-on-disney-stuff/
Time Published: 2025-11-28T13:14:37Z
Full Content:
Black Friday 2025 has officially arrived, with great deals on all sorts of Disney stuff–LEGOs, Loungefly, books, Christmas decor, collectibles, travel accessories, gadgets, tech, and more! This list rounds up the best sales on items for your Walt Disney World vacations, or that will make great gifts for the fans on your holiday gift-giving list. Although it’s finally the real Black Friday, retailers started the sale season over a month ago. We’ve been sharing deals, and have been inundated with emails from retailers and our favorite dealhunting sites about super sales for the holiday shopping season. Of course, not all deals are created equal–some “special” offers are simply marketing–but many discounts are actually quite good this year! That’s where this post comes into play–separating the cream of the crop from the marketing fluff to bring you the best deals related to Disney and travel! In this post, I’ve aggregated the best deals–some of which are Disney-specific, whereas others are non-Disney items. This includes a lot of fun items for collectors, parents, people doing gift shopping, plus things that will be useful for Walt Disney World or Disneyland vacations… If you want a broader selection of the current deals, check out Amazon’s Black Friday Sale page for the biggest savings and most popular deals. Even then, the options can be overwhelming, as there are literally tens of thousands of items on sale. If you’re not already a member, click here for a FREE 30-day Amazon Prime trial membership. For this list, we’ve combed through the various deals on Amazon’s Black Friday Sale page and are sharing only those we deem good. We receive a small commission from Amazon for your purchases, so buying through these links helps support the site. However, neither the price you pay nor our recommendations (or lack thereof) are impacted by that. Many things on sale for Black Friday are also on our Christmas Gift Guide for Disney Fans or our Ultimate Walt Disney World Packing List, so double win! Even without special offers, those are great ways to get your holiday shopping started–or create your own Christmas list. On with the list of the Best Amazon Black Friday Sale deals for 2025, first with the top picks followed by various categories… Bose QuietComfort Wireless Headphones — At 43% off and “selling fast” according to Amazon, this is one of the hottest deals of Black Friday. Sarah has owned two pairs of Bose QuietComfort headphones, which should speak volumes about what she thinks of them. They are spectacular, worth every penny, and way better than Beats or Sony headphones. The noise cancelling is perfect for flights, public transit, or just trying to work and maintain focus. The only downside is the large size. Fire 8 Kids Tablet – Even if you strive to be screen-free, this can be a lifesaver on flights or in other meltdown scenarios. This tablet for kids has parental controls, goal-setting, time limits, plus 1 FREE year of Amazon Kids+ with access to tons of educational content from PBS Kids, Nickelodeon, Disney, and more. This tablet is 54% off–plenty of others are 50% to 55% off as part of the up to 60% off Amazon devices deal (Ring cameras, Kindle readers, Echos, Fires, etc). Travel White Noise Machine – We actually bought this for traveling with our baby as it was recommended by countless parenting blogs. As it turns out, this is just great for traveling in general. That’s doubly true at Walt Disney World, where I swear that even Deluxe Resorts have paper-thin walls. Save 50%+ on Crocs – This is one of the best deals on Crocs we’ve seen in a while, and it’s on a wide variety of styles–including some non-hideous ones! Great for wearing around the house or garden, or Disney, I guess, if you think this looks good. Be sure to check for the “save 10% with brand promotion” deal sweetener on a couple of Crocs. Stokke YOYO3 Stroller – This is the Cadillac of strollers…or would be if Cadillacs were known as lightweight and nimble travel vehicles. This stroller is worth every penny, with great handling and ease of use. Most importantly, it’s incredibly light, easy to use, and folds down incredibly compact–small enough to fit in an overhead bin. We’ve tried a lot of strollers, but this is the only one we love that is perfect for travel to Walt Disney World and beyond. 20% off may not seem great, but this stroller only goes on sale once per year–on Black Friday. This is the cheapest you’ll ever see it. Playstation 5 Console – Take $100 off the Playstation 5, including various bundles (can’t go wrong with the Ghost of Yotei option). Most Disney-aged kids are going to be much better suited by the Nintendo Switch 2, but this is a great deal on the PS5, and older fans (like…my age) might favor the horsepower here. Philips GoZero Insulated Water Bottle — This insulated metal GoZero bottle by Philips has great reviews–it’s durable, BPA-free, dishwasher safe, and uses a 2-stage activated carbon filter reduces odor, chlorine and leaves zero aftertaste. 36% off for Black Friday, albeit as a Lightning Deal (so might be dead by the time you see this). Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers – This one ended up on my “for you” Black Friday deals page, which I thought was amusing given what I wrote in Disney Wants to ‘Break Spell’ of Guests Glued to Phones in Parks. Guess Big Tech isn’t always listening…or they just think I must want this because I’ve been researching it a lot. (Either way, not an actual recommendation–even if it is supposedly a popular deal.) LEGO Disney Cruella De Vil’s Car – detailed buildable replica of Cruella’s infamous car is packed with authentic features, including opening doors, a removable roof for expanded play access, and steering using the spare wheel at the back of the vehicle. This is 30% off for Black Friday, and according to Amazon it is “selling fast.” LEGO Star Wars: The Phantom Menace Battle Droid – Honestly had no idea they were still making new Phantom Menace toys (or is it a nostalgia play?). Perhaps that’s why this is on sale for 36% off, but that wouldn’t explain the “selling fast” part of the deal. LEGO Disney Frozen Advent Calendar (2025) – At 47% off, this is a scorching hot deal–the kind that will sell out via Amazon, and only be available from third party sellers for double the cost. Megatron is already a huge Frozen fan, but she’s still too young for this, so it’ll be something we hold for a couple of years. LEGO Disney Frozen Elsa’s Ice Palace – This buildable Disney Frozen toy features a 3-level ice palace with a tower, Elsa, Anna and Kristoff LEGO Disney mini-doll figures and an Olaf snowman figure. This is a stellar deal at 44% off–don’t wait for Black Friday on this one! LEGO Disney and Pixar ‘Up’ House – This 598-piece LEGO Disney toy set includes a partial house built with balloons, different rooms and functions, plus Carl Fredricksen and Russell LEGO minifigures, and a Dug LEGO dog figure for dog lovers. Good deal at 37% off. Lenox 2025 Disney Christmas Ornaments – There are several Lenox Christmas ornaments (and other decor) on sale for Black Friday, from this Mickey Mouse to Cinderella Castle! Hallmark Elsa Ornament – This doesn’t strike me as the normal Hallmark style, but it’s a cute ornament and looks reasonably high quality. Good deal. Thomas Kinkade Candy Cane Express Christmas Puzzle – It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but we love the Kinkade art style. It’s warm and cozy, even a bit schmaltzy. Comforting like a Hallmark movie, a good sweater, or a cup of coffee by the fireplace. Thomas Kinkade Disney Dreams 2026 Wall Calendar – This calendar is a must-buy every single year, and that’s doubly true for 2026 with Frozen cover art and it being 38% off for Black Friday! Moana 2 BD+DVD+Digital Combo – Is physical media making a comeback now that streaming keeps raising its prices? If so, this set at 60% off is a great deal! Get 3 for the Price of 2 – This is a deal Amazon does each year for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, with rotating products. Here’s how to take advantage: Here are our top recommendations for the 3 for 2 deal in order to maximize savings: These are all great options because every single one is an excellent book (or set of books) that’s a must-own for Disney fans. They’re also all on sale by significant amounts even before the 3 for 2 deal. Finally, they’re all priced around $30, which allows you to maximize your savings. (You don’t want to pick two ~$30 books and a $12 one, because the last one is the free one!) The Unofficial Disney Parks Cookbooks Box Set – Don’t let “unofficial” fool you. While not made by Disney, these are the definitive cookbooks from the parks and are fan-favorites. 54% off. I’m also seeing a promo to “Save $22.08 on 3 select items.” I can’t figure out how to tell which items are eligible, and this might be targeted, but I plan on adding a bunch of stuff to my cart later today and seeing what happens. Wish me luck. The Unofficial Disney Parks Holiday Cookbooks – Same idea here, but with holiday foods! Get it now for 56% off. Maps of the Disney Parks — This is a staple of our gift-giving guides, and that’s in part because it looks really nice, making it an eye-catching gift. This also has a “Save $21.03 on 3 select items” notice. Interestingly, the amounts are different between the products. Sukeen Cooling Towel 4-Pack – The cooling system on these towels uses moisture from the towel to draw the sweat away from your skin to keep you cool. We still prefer the Frogg Toggs Chilly Pad, but some Walt Disney World fans favor these. You can probably wait out this deal; these things are always on sale. JoyJolt Disney Mickey Mouse 3D Glass Cups Set of 2 – JoyJolt Disney coffee cups aren’t your regular double walled glasses. Look inside and you’ll discover Disney’s Mickey Mouse inside your coffee in optical 3D. Great deal at 40%! Mickey Pants and Minnie Skirt 3D Double Wall Glass Coffee Cups – Same story here with these coffee cups. Note that you can toggle between two sizes here, too. Only the smaller size is a great deal. (Another larger option is the JoyJolt Mickey & Pluto Sketch Art Mugs, also on sale for 20% off.) Simple Modern Disney Kids Tumbler – Two of Megatron’s biggest obsessions are cups and Minnie/Mickey Mouse. And of course, she wants huge cups–not kid-sized ones–because that’s what mom and dad use! Predictably, things go terribly wrong when we let her use our Tervises. This spill-proof 24 ounce stainless steel tumbler looks like a great alternative…and this type of cup is all the rage now, right? Corkcicle x Disney Minnie Mouse Tumbler – You should recognize the Corkcicle name from their partnership with Walt Disney World and sponsoring of many EPCOT events. At 30% off for a larger and nicer-looking cup, this seems like a better deal than the previous entry. Serenity Kids Baby Food Pouches – Several readers have asked what Megatron eats in the parks. By and large, this is the answer. On sale for Black Friday. Cerebelly Baby Food Pouches – And this, which is also on sale for Black Friday. FuelRod 2-Pack – Did you ever think you’d see the day when Disney Tourist Blog dot com was actively endorsing this controversial charger? Well, we just did. An exceptional deal was involved that helped make up our minds in favor of the new and improved device. There’s actually a FuelRod 3-Pack on sale that’s an even better deal on a per unit basis–it just comes down to whether you need three of them (I’d say that’s the smart move for families, but solo travelers or couples should be fine with two.) FuelRod MAX10 – The newest swappable device is not a rod at all, but rather, a brick. This is their biggest and fastest charger, and a great deal after clipping the coupon on the product page. FuelRod – This is the weakest deal on a per unit basis, but it might make sense to get your feet wet with just one FuelRod before buying multiples. Not what we recommend, but still a solid deal! 25% Off Amazon Warehouse Deals/Resale – Not a specific deal, but rather, up to 25% off one Amazon Resale purchase (exact savings varies by category). We buy a lot of stuff this way, as what’s meant by resale is actually returns. This was actually a better deal last week when early Black Friday sales started. It was 30% off then, had more item eligibility, and there was greater selection–a lot sold out during that deal. Still, 25% off is better than nothing, and some items have been restocked. Anker Zolo 10,000mAh 30W Portable Charger with Built-in USB-C Cable for Travel – This charger is–without a doubt–the charger we’d buy if we had phones with a USB-C connector instead of the Lightning connector. This one is 23% off for Black Friday Week. Also available in 20k capacity. Anker 24,000mAh Power Bank 3-Port Portable Charger with 140W Output – For those who really go hard playing the Lightning Lane refresh game. An okay deal at 32% off, but don’t be surprised if it’s cheaper on Cyber Monday. There’s also the newer version that’s 35% off and supposedly “selling fast.” Anker 3-Port 140W Charging Block – This is a niche product, but it’s another game-changer for me. This Anker 3-port block charges my Nikon mirrorless camera, laptop, and phone simultaneously and the device is smaller than my Macbook charger by itself. I just upgraded to this during Prime Day from the prior generation–I’ve been very happy with both. Great deal at 40% off! Anker 47W Nano 3 USB-C Charger – This is what Sarah uses, and it’s absolutely perfect for her–or the average person. It’ll charge your devices faster than the standard charger (and lightyears quicker than in-wall ports at WDW hotels), and it’s 40% off for Black Friday. I believe this is the cheapest it’s ever been. Anker PowerPort Cube Strip with 3 Outlets and 3 USB Ports – Disney has refurbished many of its rooms, adding USB ports in the process, but many of them don’t work–or don’t work well. Plus, this has fast-charging to get devices recharged quicker and USB-C. There are a ton of other Anker products on sale as part of the Black Friday deals, but that’s usually the case with sales like this. One new-to-me sale is this Anker Portable Generator, which isn’t even a product that I realized they made. Obviously not for Disney (unless you’re a Fort Wilderness camper!), but intriguing at 56% off! Gonex Compression Packing Cubes – They key here is that these are compression packing cubes, which normally cost more and will save you even more space when packing. If you need the suitcase space, we recommend this set over the one below. Be sure to clip the coupon for more off. Gonex Packable Backpack — Another excellent innovation from the fine folks at Gonex…a brand I’ve literally never heard of outside the ‘packable’ space. This takes up minimal room in your suitcase and more importantly is super lightweight. That minimizes the amount of back-sweat you’ll have to endure from the Florida heat and humidity. Be sure to clip the coupon–that’s the only way this is a deal. Gonex Packable Duffel Bag – I swear this post isn’t sponsored by Gonex. It just happens that we have a lot of their products because they’re often deeply discounted on Amazon’s various deal days. In this case, we use the packable duffel whenever traveling internationally to bring home everything we buy. And not just Disney stuff. Thanks to the strength of the dollar, we stock up on everything. During a recent trip to Japan, we went antiquing and thrifting, and I also dropped a ridiculous amount at UNIQLO. On the plus side, I won’t have to buy socks or undershirts for the next few years! Personal Neck Fan – We bought this little device a couple years ago, and it’s shockingly effective. It’s like that refreshing feeling you get when walking past an open doorway of an air-conditioned building. It’s not perfect, but it’s a really fantastic idea, and is a breath of fresh air during hot and humid days in Florida (which is ~10 months of the year). Handheld Portable Small Fan (USB Chargeable) – If you don’t want to be quite as dorky with the neck fan and don’t want to wear a cooling towel, this classic handheld fan is the more traditional option for keeping cool. It ends up being under $10 after discount and clipping the coupon on the product page. Packing Cube Sets (Multiple Sizes) – Another staple of our packing list, we are fans of packing cubes and these are a solid deal. (With that said, there are a LOT of packing cubes on sale, so you might want to browse the results for “packing cubes” on the Amazon Black Friday page and see which sizes/colors/etc. best suit you.) Loungefly Pumpking Minnie Mouse Backpack – This is one of several Loungefly backpacks that’s 50% off. A cute bag at a great price, so long as you don’t mind holding onto it for ~9 months. Loungefly Organizer – I can’t imagine why you’d want to reduce the amount of usable space in your already small backpack, but I’m told this is very popular. And on sale for Black Friday. Knockoff Loungefly Bag – Calling a spade a spade, this is basically a bootleg Loungefly bag. Now, I am definitely NOT the target audience for such a product, but as someone who doesn’t “get” how on earth Loungeflys are so expensive, I think this is a far, far superior option! More Loungefly Black Friday Deals – Lots of other Loungefly products on sale, including several more Disney items…some of which are kinda ugly TBH. 12 Beloved Disney Classic Little Golden Books (Boxed Set) – This is one of two Disney Little Golden Book box sets that are on sale for deep discounts. This is truly classics, with one-dozen Walt Disney Little Golden Books originally published in the 1950s and 1960s. This one is 62% off, making each title $2.25! Ultimate Princess Boxed Set of 12 Little Golden Books – This is 47% off! 3 for 2 Little Golden Books – There are actually a ton more options as part of that sale–here’s a full rundown of titles. Bedtime Favorites Storybook Collection – With 18 stories and 250 illustrations, this is a great option for bedtime reading to little ones. Disney Princess Cookbook – From Rapunzel’s Frying Pan Eggs to Ariel’s Sea Turtle Cupcakes, this beautiful cookbook is filled with delicious recipes inspired by the Princesses’ many adventures. Disney Storybook Collection — A large, 300+ page hardcover book retelling several classic Disney stories complete with 250 pieces of artwork from the Disney Archives. Walt Disney’s Disneyland — One of my favorite Disneyland books of all-time at a crazy-good price. Anyone who has owned or even held a TASCHEN book knows why this is something special. This is an incredibly high-quality coffee table book, and well worth more than price. Holiday Magic at the Disney Parks: Celebrations Around the World — This is an incredible deep dive into the holidays (mostly Christmas and Halloween, but also Easter and other seasonal events) with great photos, detailed information, and rich history. If you love the seasonal events, this is an absolute must-own. Poster Art of the Disney Parks, Second Edition – This new title is an expanded and updated edition of the beloved book that ranks highly in our library. The second edition renders the first obsolete, as the 85+ new posters and behind-the-scenes development info nearly doubles the book in length. It’s worth it for all of the awesome new posters made for EPCOT’s reimagining alone. Okay, that’s it for right now. There are a bunch of other great deals that are irrelevant to Disney and travel (but also don’t appeal to me) on the Amazon Black Friday Sale homepage. We recommend browsing for yourself a bit, and checking back often, as new deals are regularly appearing–and disappearing. Just be mindful of the fact that some of these offers are time-sensitive, so you don’t want to spend too much time procrastinating and end up losing out! Be sure to check back here throughout the coming days, as I’ll share new discounts and more Lightning Deals as they become available.

Title: 6 companies that have signaled they are replacing human employees with AI
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/list-companies-replacing-human-employees-with-ai-layoffs-workforce-reductions
Time Published: 2025-11-28T13:02:04Z
Full Content:
Worries about AI one day replacing human workers have intensified in recent years — and as it turns out, that future has already arrived. MIT just released a study that found that AI can already replace 11.7% of the US labor market. The study utilized a labor simulation tool called the Iceberg Index, which models 151 million US workers and measures how AI overlaps with skills in each occupation. As AI starts to replace human workers, companies have been increasingly open about the role AI adoption is playing in recent layoffs. However, while some companies have directly cited AI as a reason for workforce reductions, others have vacillated with their messaging, leaving ambiguity around the exact reasoning and whether AI is directly replacing workers. Even as some companies replace human workers with AI, they might end up hiring more people in other roles because of it. A World Economic Forum survey found that 41% of companies globally are expected to reduce their workforces over the next five years because of AI. Meanwhile, tech jobs in big data, fintech, and AI are expected to double by 2030, the WEF said. Here's a list of companies that are replacing — or signaling they may replace — humans with AI. HP said it's reducing the size of its corporate workforce as a result of AI initiatives. In an earnings report on Tuesday, the company said it plans to cut between 4,000 and 6,000 jobs by the end of 2028, estimating the changes would save around $1 billion. HP's earnings presentation said part of its strategy was to cut costs through "workforce reductions, platform simplification, programs consolidation, and productivity measures" and to increase customer satisfaction, innovation, and productivity with "artificial intelligence adoption and enablement." Arvind Krishna, CEO of IBM, told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year that it had replaced hundreds of human resources employees with AI. More recently, the company announced in November that it would cut thousands of workers in the fourth quarter of 2025, affecting a "single-digit percentage of its global workforce." Its CEO, Arvind Krishna, said the company is shifting priorities to hire more people around AI and quantum. He also said the company plans to increase hiring among recent college graduates over the next year. Krishna has also said AI adoption has led to the company hiring more employees in programming and sales. In 2023, Krishna told Bloomberg that IBM had halted or slowed hiring for back-office roles, like in human resources, that could be replaced by AI. "I could easily see 30% of that getting replaced by AI and automation over a five-year period," he told the outlet at the time. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that AI-driven efficiency gains would shrink the retail giant's workforce in the coming years — but when the company announced it was cutting 14,000 jobs in October, Jassy said the cuts were about culture, not AI. "The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least," Jassy said in the company's most recent earnings call. "It really — it's culture." An Amazon spokesperson also reiterated to Business Insider that the cuts were not driven by AI. When the layoffs were announced, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology wrote in a blog post that the move reflected a continued effort to run the company "like the world's largest startup." The SVP, Beth Galetti, also referenced a need to be leaner in the age of AI. "This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before," Galetti wrote in the post. In an episode of "The Logan Bartlett Show" released in August, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said the company was using AI agents in the customer support division to replace humans and help the company work through more sales leads. "I was able to rebalance my head count on my support," he said in the interview. "I've reduced it from 9,000 heads to about 5,000 because I need less heads." A Salesforce spokesperson told Business Insider that Benioff was referencing an organizational transformation that took place over several months to reshape its customer support function. After deploying Agentforce, the company no longer needed to "actively backfill support engineer roles," the spokesperson said, adding that it successfully redeployed hundreds of employees into other areas of the company, like professional services, sales, and customer success. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said in 2024 that the company could operate effectively with half its current staff. A spokesperson for the company said its AI assistant now handles the equivalent workload of 853 full-time agents, up from 700 at launch. That's saving an estimated $58 million annually, the spokesperson said. After its CEO acknowledged that previous cost-cutting measures had gone too far, the buy-now-pay-later firm redeployed workers to customer support roles. However, the spokesperson said that Siemiatkowski's comments were in reference to outsourced support quality, not limitations of AI. The recent in-house hires were a "tiny pilot" of under 10 people aimed at improving the quality of outsourced agents, not replacing AI, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson added that the company never removed human support entirely, and it still works with outsourced teams of around 2,000. Micha Kaufman, the CEO and founder of Fiverr, said in September that the company was slashing roughly 30% of its workforce. The cut would affect about 250 team members, and the freelancing platform had 762 full-time employees as of 2024, according to an SEC filing. The CEO said that the cuts were needed to help turn Fiverr into a leaner and faster "AI-first company." Kaufman said in a staff memo in April that AI was "coming for your jobs," and in May, he told Business Insider that Fiverr would only hire people who know how to use AI. "If you don't ensure that you sharpen your knives, you're going to be left behind. It's that simple," Kaufman said.Correction: December 1, 2025 — The bullet points of this article have been updated to clarify Amazon's statements about how AI may affect its workforce. Jump to

Cyber Monday 2025 Absolute Best Deals Deals Under $100 Laptop Deals Kindle Deals Apple Deals Tech Deals Now Reading Headphone Deals Sleep Deals Phone Deals Coffee Deals Smart Birdfeeder Deals Welcome to WIRED’s guide to the best Cyber Monday tech deals, where we can promise you two things: these devices are worth buying (we’ve tested and recommended every one of them), and these are actual discounts (not the year-round price). So, whether you need an upgrade, want to treat yourself, or are seeking a great gift, we have you covered. Want a wider range of deals? Check out the Absolute Best Cyber Monday Deals roundup to find more bargains. Updated December 1: We've added deals on a Nest Doorbell, Eufy robot vacuum, TP-Link security camera, LG OLED TV, Ceptics travel adapter, Google Pixel Watch 4, Sony surround sound system, and Viture smart glasses. Google Amazon Best Buy Google Store The Google Pixel 10 is one of the best Android phones you can buy. Easy to recommend at full price, the Pixel 10 is an absolute bargain with this discount. You get an excellent triple-camera system with a 5X optical zoom sensor, support for Qi2 wireless charging, so you can magnetically attach to wireless chargers and docks, and Google’s super smart software features (Call Screen to filter out spam calls is our favorite). Learn more in the Best Pixel Phones guide. Sony Amazon Walmart Best Buy Target The PlayStation 5 Pro is $100 off right now, and it's the way to play all the best PS5 games with the graphics cranked up to their maximum quality. Sony's console comes with one controller, but since Sony's Dual Sense Controller ($55) is also on sale right now, I'd snag another one. There are discounts on quite a few PS bundles, too. Razer Razer This svelte gaming laptop has a great OLED screen, a tactile keyboard that's a joy to type and game on, and an RTX 5090 graphics card inside to run the latest titles. It even has a decent selection of ports. In short, the Razer Blade 16 is one of the best gaming laptops, according to WIRED reviewer, Luke Larsen, and this is a rare, hefty discount. Nest Amazon Walmart Google Best Buy This has been the top pick in our best video doorbells guide for a while now. While it's limited to 1080p (the new model is 2K), this is battery-powered, so it's still a great choice if you can't hard wire. Google's alerts are pretty reliable, and there are some smart features (including facial recognition) if you can stomach the subscription. Eufy Amazon The top pick in our best robot vacuums for half price is a deal worth jumping on. Free yourself from daily cleaning with this self-emptying robot vacuum that navigates well, uses AI to identify obstacles (semi-successfully), and has a mopping function. Google Amazon Best Buy Google Store The Pixel 9a is our top smartphone choice for most people, and it's now $50 cheaper than it was on Black Friday itself. At $349, you're getting a smooth-performing smartphone with a reliable dual-camera system that's unmatched at this price, not to mention day-long battery life and a completely flat camera lens system for anyone who hates giant camera bumps. Oh, and it'll get 7 years of software updates. Sony Amazon B&H Photo Adorama Sony's A7 IV is the best mirrorless camera on the market (for most people). It's a 33-megapixel, full-frame camera with a brilliant autofocus system, impressive dynamic range, and crisp images. There's an expansive range of 4K video options as well, along with customizable buttons to set up your preferences, so you don't have to always rummage through the menus. Reviewer Scott Gilbertson found the grip to be super comfortable and the camera to be light enough to endure for long periods without any back strain. —Boutayna Chokrane Soundcore by Anker Amazon Soundcore If you're shopping for open earbuds so that you can enjoy your music but still be aware of your surroundings, the Soundcore Aeroclip is the best we've tested so far. Reviewer Ryan Waniata praises the comfort, sound quality, usability, and value. The sound is wide and balanced, and the built-in controls are ideal for runs. Waniata likes to use them during outdoor activities, like hiking or biking, but he finds them especially helpful when he's cooking dinner and needs to stay alert for his newborn's cries. —Boutayna Chokrane Fitbit Amazon Best Buy Editor Adrienne So says the Fitbit Ace LTE is the first fitness tracker she's gotten her kids to use. It's a fitness tracker (designed with Fitbit's health sensors), gaming device, and location tracker. The $10/monthly subscription includes both LTE connectivity and Fitbit Arcade, which has a variety of movement-based games that get children on their feet and incentivize them to keep their watches on. They can call and text their guardians (and other approved contacts) through the Fitbit Ace app, and their location is trackable via Google Find My. —Boutayna Chokrane Belkin Amazon Best Buy Belkin After testing many, many Apple 3-in-1 wireless chargers, this is the one that claimed a permanent place on my bedside table. I love the classy mix of chrome and soft-touch black plastic and the weighted base enables you to grab your iPhone without pulling the whole charger off your nightstand. The iPhone pad also tilts and holds your iPhone vertically or horizontally, with support for StandBy mode. It can fast charge capable iPhone and Apple Watch models and charge any AirPods with a wireless charging case. The 5-foot braided cable is permanently attached and there’s a 36-watt wall charger in the box. TP-Link Amazon B&H TP-Link Compact and affordable, with an IP66 rating, this security camera can be used indoors or out, though it must be plugged in. It offers smart detection (people, pets, and vehicles), up to 2K resolution, and slightly laggy two-way audio. You can record locally on a microSD card or subscribe for cloud storage. This versatile device also has a magnetic mount and tiny dual spotlights. Philips Hue Amazon Best Buy This is a rare and tasty deal on my favorite Xmas lights. They work indoors or out, can be scheduled, and support a bunch of lovely animated effects. While I'm mentioning Philips Hue and its excellent but horribly expensive wares, you might want to check out some of its other Cyber Monday deals. My picks would be the wall washers ($316), TV lightstrip ($125), and HDMI sync box ($270). Asus Amazon Walmart Asus The Asus RT-BE58U is perhaps the ideal Wi-Fi 7 upgrade for modest homes and apartments still struggling with the crappy router their internet service provider sent, and that's why it tops our Best Wi-Fi Routers guide. It’s easy to set up and use, can cover up to 2,000 square feet, and boasts plenty of ports. As a dual-band router, it lacks the 6-GHz band, but has all the other advantages of Wi-Fi 7. There’s also support for VPN service, separate IoT or guest networks, and Ai Mesh. Satechi Best Buy Amazon Satechi B&H Photo Don't ask me why they keep taking our ports away. God forbid you should want to plug something into your laptop. Well, you can stick it to those minimalist designers with the best laptop docking station. This one doubles as a wedge to prop your laptop up and has a storage slot. Sony Amazon Walmart B&H Photo These wireless noise-canceling headphones may not be the latest release from Sony, but they are still an excellent pair of cans with a far deeper discount. The Sony WH-1000XM5 are relatively light and comfortable, producing accomplished sound in every scenario, and have great control options. LG Amazon Walmart LG Costco If you haven't made the leap to OLED TVs, you are in for a treat. Unparalleled contrast awaits, but OLEDs aren't just about inky blacks anymore, LG's top TV features glare reduction for bright rooms, deep and rich colors, and wonderful picture clarity, not to mention excellent upscaling. It's pricey, but this is a chunky discount. Roku Amazon Walmart If you want to get the latest streaming apps on an older TV, the Roku Streaming Stick Plus is for you. It’s easy to set up, works reliably, and has a handy voice remote that makes finding content easier than ever. It slots neatly behind most TVs, and Roku’s interface is nice and clear. Apple Amazon Amazon Walmart Apple Apple doesn’t really do sales, but other retailers do. This is the lowest price we’ve seen on a solid iPad the whole family can enjoy. The Apple iPad (A16, 2025) performs great for most tasks, looks pretty nice, and has a 12-megapixel camera. It is honestly all the iPad most folks need for surfing the web and streaming shows in bed. With iPadOS 26 and the new windowing apps feature, you can even comfortably do some work if you pair it with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Nimble Amazon (Medium) Amazon (Small) Amazon (Large) Nimble (All) Handy as they are for keeping you connected when your phone dies unexpectedly, portable chargers can be very same-y. The reason the Nimble Champ tops our Best Power Banks guide is Nimble’s focus on the environment. It’s made from 90 percent certified recycled plastic and comes in fully biodegradable packaging. It also works well, with capacities starting from 5,200 mAh, with USB-A and USB-C ports, and up to 15-watt charging. Amazon Amazon Amazon (Signature) Yes, you should read more, and Amazon’s Kindle e-readers make it easier to do exactly that. Our current favorite is the Kindle Paperwhite (12th generation). It has a sharp 7-inch display, auto-adjusting warm light, three-month battery life, snappy performance, and it’s slim and light, making it comfortable to hold. It even has integration with Overdrive for your library books and support for several languages. reMarkable Amazon (With Marker Plus and Book Folio) ReMarkable (with Marker Plus) ReMarkable (With Marker) The reMarkable 2 is one of the best digital notebooks, offering a paperlike writing experience, intuitive software, and several weeks of battery life. This is a budget model, so it lacks front light and color, but it’s still a decent device. Bundles where you choose both a marker and folio are heavily discounted right now, and they’re not often on sale, so it’s a good time to snap one up. Nomad Amazon Nomad The great thing about Nomad’s 65-watt charger is that it’s incredibly slim, with flip-out prongs, so it can slip easily into small pockets in your bag or purse. You get dual USB-C ports, and can pull 45 watts out of the left port and 20 out of the right. Or, if you’re just charging one device, the full 65 watts is enough for any phone, most tablets, and even some MacBooks or Windows laptops (though they may not charge at top speed). Anthbot Amazon Anthbot You know what I don't miss in the slightest? Mowing the lawn. A good robot mower, like this relatively affordable one from newcomer Anthbot, will do it for you, quietly. No wire required; it recharges itself, you just set a schedule and relax. OK, it sometimes leaves a verge, but the only model I've tried that doesn't is more than twice the price. Arlo Amazon Best Buy Sharp 2K video, color night vision, a wide 160-degree field of view, and clear two-way audio make the Arlo Pro 5S easy to recommend for folks seeking a security camera. You also get AI recognition for people and pets, a siren to scare intruders, and the quick-loading Arlo app. But you need Arlo Secure ($8 per month for one camera or $13 per month for unlimited cameras) for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. The Arlo Pro 5S is our pick of the best outdoor security cameras. Oura Oura Amazon Best Buy I love my Oura Ring 4. It accurately tracks my sleep, activity, and stress levels and offers insights that I find genuinely useful. It’s also very comfortable, the app is super slick, with new features being added all the time, and it’s far less obtrusive than any other kind of tracker you could wear. The catch is a subscription, but this is still the best of the best smart rings. Backbone Amazon (USB-C) Walmart (USB-C) Best Buy (USB-C) Amazon (Lightning) It’s the thoughtful design that elevates the Backbone One above the rest of the best mobile controllers. Slot your phone into the compact cradle, with a USB-C jack for speedy connectivity, and you get satisfyingly clicky and responsive controls plus a 3.5-mm headphone port. You can also customize it for different games, or even use Backbone’s software as a one-stop gaming hub, if you’re willing to pay a subscription. Ray-Ban Amazon Ray-Ban Meta Yes, there is a new version of the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers, but the good news is that the old pair is now on sale. If you can stomach Meta AI’s privacy policies, there’s a strong argument that it has won the smart glasses race already (at least, so far). The best smart glasses must be easy to wear, and these look great and help offload things from your phone, so you don’t have to dip into that pocket quite as much. Ceptics Amazon My pick of the best travel adapters will keep all of your gadgetry running wherever you travel. There's a classic slider design for the plug that covers more than 200 countries, but you also get one USB-C port, two USB-A ports, and a handy retractable USB-C cable (perfect if you're forgetful). JBL Amazon Walmart Best Buy JBL The JBL Flip 7 is the Bluetooth speaker that has it all. It's durable, it has stamina, it produces a punchy sound, and it comes in fun colors. As the best Bluetooth speaker you can buy, this deal is for real. Tonies Amazon Target Toniebox is our favorite speaker for young kids, particularly ages three through seven. It's essentially a squishy cube that plays stories and songs tied to different characters (aka Tonies). It's activated when your child places the figurine on top of the speaker. There are so many Tonies to choose from. Peppa Pig, Moana, Winnie the Pooh, the list goes on. You can also buy Creative Tonies to record your own audio. Super easy to use, and the cutesy ears double as volume controls. —Boutayna Chokrane Amazon Bookshop.org The best tech books unpack the rise and fall of the characters that invented the stuff that runs our lives. The New York Times and former Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou writes about Elizabeth Holmes, as she miserably fails to build a blood testing machine that would allegedly eliminate the need for hypodermic needles. Her company raised hundreds of millions of dollars, but its technology was inaccurate. Rather than admit defeat, she pressed on, which is why Holmes was put on trial for fraud and sentenced to 11 years in prison. —Boutayna Chokrane Google Amazon (45 mm) Amazon (41 mm) Best Buy Google Store Google's smartwatch is the perfect partner for your Pixel phone, or any Android phone. The Pixel Watch 4 is comfy, with a lovely domed design and a very bright display. It also offers accurate health and fitness tracking, impressive battery life, and fast charging. You can also snag a pair of Pixel Buds 2a pretty cheap right now as they're $99 ($30 off). Samsung Amazon (S25) Amazon (S25)+ Amazon (Ultra) Samsung (All) Samsung's flagship Galaxy S25 has been heavily discounted all Cyber Weekend, probably because its successors are right around the corner (the Galaxy S26 series is expected to be announced in January). But we still love these excellent smartphones. The S25 is the smallest, the S25+ gets a few extra perks, plus a bigger screen and better battery life, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra has a dual telephoto camera system, integrated S Pen stylus, and a beefy battery. Be sure to check out the Best Samsung Phones guide for the full scoop. —Molly Higgins Samsung Amazon (Flip7) Amazon (Fold7) Samsung (Flip7) Samsung (Fold7) You're not like other girls; you have a folding phone. In all seriousness, folding phones are not as fragile as they used to be, with durability improving while remaining slim. We love the Galaxy Z Fold7 because it's amazingly slim and versatile. You can use the front screen like normal, and when you need extra real estate, open the device up. You can view apps on a much larger scale or easily split-screen two apps. If you're not feeling a folding phone, the updated Galaxy Z Flip7 has a more usable front screen. Read our Best Folding Phones guide to decide which is best for you at the discounted price this Cyber Weekend. —Molly Higgins Apple Amazon Best Buy Even though they're an older model, we like these AirPods because of their hearing aid feature, comfort, and outstanding streaming experience. If you're an iPhone user, you should have some AirPods, and we still think these are a good choice for most people because of their active noise cancellation, sound quality, and easy pairing within the Apple ecosystem. Plus, it doesn't hurt that they're nearly 25 percent off for Cyber Monday. —Molly Higgins Amazon Amazon (3-Pack) Amazon (2-Pack) Best Buy (3-Pack) We love Amazon's Eero mesh systems for being so easy to set up and use, but they also double as smart home hubs with support for Matter, Thread, and Zigbee. The Eero Pro 6E is a tri-band mesh that adds the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands. For busy households with many devices and a 1 Gbps or faster connection, this mesh system is ideal. Just bear in mind that the 6-GHz band is short-range. The pricey Eero Plus subscription is an extra $10 per month or $100 per year, but adds so much value with parental controls, advanced security, ad blocking, and even a password manager and VPN service. Apple Amazon Best Buy Apple We on the WIRED Reviews team still think this is the best Apple Watch for most people. With its newest upgrade, it now has the latest S10 chip, a Liquid Glass display, Workout Buddy, and wrist-flick gestures. If you have an iPhone, this accessory is a no-brainer. It makes a great gift for yourself or others, and is seriously discounted at only $200 right now. —Molly Higgins Sony Amazon B&H Up your home theater game with a surround sound system from Sony. The Bravia Theater System 6 has a classy, understated design, combining a beefy subwoofer, two tall and musical surround speakers, and a small center soundbar to envelop you in audio. It's a great way to get more from your movies. Viture Amazon Best Buy If you want a virtual screen for gaming that you can take anywhere, the Viture Luma Pro XR are my pick of the best smart glasses for gaming. These glasses can plug directly into your phone (and many other gadgets) via USB-C to give you a 152-inch screen. This bundle comes with an excellent 8BitDo controller.

Title: Crypto industry pledges over $3M to victims of Hong Kong’s deadliest fire in decades

The crypto industry rushed to the aid of Hong Kong residents who suffered the city’s most devastating fire in 80 years, claiming the lives of at least 128 people. Some of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges and Web3 companies have pledged millions of dollars to support victims of the deadly fire at the Wang Fuk Court apartment complex in Hong Kong’s Tai Po District, highlighting the sector’s growing role in real-world relief efforts. Three centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs) have publicly pledged to donate $24.78 million Hong Kong dollars ($3.19 million) to aid the victims of the devastating fire, which claimed the lives of at least 128 residents. The donations included $1.5 million from Bitget exchange, $1.28 million from Binance, and about $256,000 from KuCoin exchange. Bitget contributed the largest share, aiming to support reconstruction and recovery in the affected community, Bitget CEO Gracy Chen said Friday on X, adding that the exchange “stands with Hong Kong, wishing affected residents a swift recovery and rebuilding of their homes.” The two-day fire began on Wednesday at the Wang Fuk Court complex and spread to seven high-rise buildings before being extinguished on Friday, in what the media have described as Hong Kong’s deadliest fire in 80 years. Related: BlackRock ETF investors bounce back to profit as price reclaims $90K Hong Kong-based Web3 intellectual property company Animoca Brands has also started a token-based fundraiser, aiming to collect funds from the crypto community via an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and a Solana (SOL) wallet address. The fundraiser is collecting donations until Dec. 2. The company pledged to convert 100% of the proceeds to Hong Kong dollars by Dec. 3, to support the relief efforts of the Hong Kong Red Cross. For transparency, Animoca will post a donation receipt showing the final amount collected and donated, the company said in a Thursday announcement. Animoca’s EVM-compatible wallet had collected $171,000 while its Solana wallet collected $1,500 in cryptocurrency donations at the time of writing, according to cryptocurrency intelligence platform Nansen. Tron Network founder Justin Sun also pledged an undisclosed amount to the fire victims. Related: Over 8% of Bitcoin changed hands in week, markets on ‘knife’s edge,’ Analysts say Cryptocurrency-based donations have emerged as a significant lifeline for disaster-stricken regions and underdeveloped economies lacking banking infrastructure. In 2024, crypto donations surpassed $1 billion, driven by large-scale transfers to the victims of the earthquake in Thailand and Myanmar. Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao alone donated nearly $600,000 to the disaster relief fund in April 2024, following a 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck Thailand and Myanmar on March 28. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also been known for his crypto donations. In October 2024, Buterin donated over $180,000 in Ether (ETH) to the biotech charity Kanro.

Title: Google's AI Progress Drives MediaTek To Best Week Since 2002
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/googles-ai-progress-drives-mediatek-to-best-week-since-2002
Time Published: 2025-11-28T11:21:14Z
Full Content:
MediaTek Inc. shares posted their best week since 2002, as artificial intelligence advances at its client Google help reshape the growth outlook for the Taiwanese chipmaker. The stock rose for a fifth-straight day Friday in Taipei, taking its weekly gain to 22%, on investor enthusiasm over Google’s latest Gemini model and AI chip deals. MediaTek has reportedly partnered with the Alphabet Inc. unit on design of tensor processing units, seen as a potential rival to Nvidia Corp. chips in AI applications. Known for its smartphone chips, MediaTek has suffered from a cloudy outlook for end-product demand as well as margin pressure due to competition and high development costs. The AI news has brought relief for the shares, which are still down 1% on the year. China business remains tough into 2026, yet “Google TPU upside should offset the smartphone headwind in the longer term,” according to Morgan Stanley analysts Charlie Chan and Daniel Yen. They upgraded the stock to overweight from equal-weight on Thursday. The early days of AI centered on training of large language models, which requires the massive computing power provided by graphic processing units such as those from Nvidia. The shift in focus to inference — or how LLMs respond to user queries — is putting a spotlight on application-specific integrated circuits such as TPUs. UBS Group AG analysts led by Sunny Lin raised their estimate for MediaTek’s sales contribution from TPUs in 2027 to $4 billion from $1.8 billion. The analysts see the chips accounting for 20% of the company’s operating profit by 2028, “depending on execution by MediaTek and Google,” they wrote in a note dated Thursday. Part of this week’s excitement was due to news that Meta Platforms Inc. is in discussions to use Google TPUs in data centers in 2027. UBS sees further potential upside for MediaTek from additional ASIC projects with Meta. The sell-side overall is bullish on MediaTek, with 23 buy recommendations, 10 holds and no sells. The consensus price target projects a further 9% rise in the stock over the next year. In terms of future AI stock investing, Macquarie Group Ltd. analysts including Arthur Lai say they “lean more” toward MediaTek and other Google partners over the Nvidia supply chain. “We view the current AI surge as less a speculative bubble but rather a necessary, capital-intensive build-out of a new, foundational technology layer,” they wrote in a report this week.

Each time one of Tamara Modig’s children needs a telehealth appointment, she boots up a fragile 13-year-old laptop and prays it’ll hold a charge. Then Modig is forced to fret with another concern: the cost of health care. The Fitchburg Public Schools employee and her husband pay more than $9,300 annually in health insurance premiums for their family of five. It’s already a substantial chunk of their combined $160,000 income. Modig knows it’s almost certainly going to rise next year, though she won’t learn how much until spring. Already, her out-of-pocket maximum this past year increased by $1,000, to $4,000. The family doesn’t take vacations, drives only used cars, and lives on a strict budget — which is about to get even stricter. “You wonder if you can make that pair of shoes last longer,” Modig said. “Does last year’s coat still fit the kids?” FEATURED VIDEO The rising price of health insurance has become top of mind in many households across the state as families like the Modigs take stock during traditional open enrollment periods. Many employers’ premiums have risen by 10 percent or more, insurers and brokers say, straining families’ budgets at a time when overall health care costs are on the rise and expected to grow even more in the coming years. “This is the hardest health insurance market I’ve seen in two decades, with no end in sight,” said David Shore, executive vice president at Borislow Insurance, which helps companies across the East Coast, including in Massachusetts, navigate insurance and funding options. “It’s only going to get worse.” The costs aren’t just growing — they are exacerbating an affordability crisis for state residents and businesses, experts say. The Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a business-backed policy group, recently cited health care costs as a top concern, with Massachusetts having among the highest employer health care costs in the country. Advertisement Rising premiums, plus out-of-pocket health care costs, are all outpacing increases in household income, inflation, and other indicators of economic growth. As a result, Massachusetts is increasingly unaffordable to live in, said David Seltz, executive director of the state Health Policy Commission, during a recent hearing. Massachusetts had the highest insurance premiums in the US last year. And the years of consistent, rising premium costs in the state have long surpassed national trends. Families in Massachusetts spent, on average, $28,151 for employer-based health insurance last year, according to data presented by the Health Policy Commission, a state agency. Nationally, that figure was $24,540. And that’s just premiums. Consumers face other health care costs, including co-pays and deductibles. All told, the average annual cost of health care coverage for a family in Massachusetts was $32,469 in 2024. Since 2024, insurance costs have grown. Family premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance grew 6 percent nationally from 2024 to 2025, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey of employers. Because official data sources lag, it’s difficult to assess private insurance prices planned for 2026 in real time. But regardless of how a person gets commercial insurance — whether purchasing for themselves on the state’s insurance marketplace, going through a broker, getting it directly from an insurer, or receiving insurance through an employer — costs are seemingly on the rise for everyone next year. The state’s insurance exchange, where people and small businesses can buy their own insurance, has reported its premiums will increase by 11.5 percent, on average, in 2026. Those premium increases range from 7.2 percent by Fallon Health to 13.6 percent by Boston Medical Center Health Plan, which also goes by WellSense Health Plan. Advertisement These hikes and others mean small businesses are maxed out on health care costs, said Jon Hurst, president of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts. “We’re at a breaking point,” Hurst said. Beyond pending retirements, profitability is flat and health care and energy costs have skyrocketed, meaning about half of small businesses in Massachusetts predicted they would have to sell or close within five years, a UMass Donahue Institute study showed in February. For businesses, premium increases can depend on a number of factors, including an employer’s size, health care usage trends, and how the employer purchases insurance. Less than half of Massachusetts employers are considered “fully insured,” meaning they buy insurance in which the insurer takes on the financial responsibility for paying out medical claims. Most of the employers in this group who have 50 to 100 employees are seeing whopping premium increases that range from 10 to 30 percent, said Mark Gaunya, principal at Borislow Insurance, which works with hundreds of companies of varying sizes. Larger employers in this bucket are more likely to see smaller price increases, he said, though things vary. Most employers in Massachusetts, however, are considered “self-insured” as they pay for the health care claims of their employees more directly. These types of workplaces are also seeing premium increases, from low single digit to low double digits. “I haven’t seen rate increases like this in a long, long time,” Gaunya said of the industry at large. “The market is really, really hard right now for a lot of people.” The state’s two largest insurers cited figures that were similar. At Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, “fully-insured” employers are seeing high single to low double-digit increases on average, though numbers vary widely depending on other factors, the insurer said. For its own employees, Blue Cross passed on an average 20 percent premium increase. Advertisement At Point32Health, premiums for employers with over 50 employees are increasing by about 15 to 20 percent on average in 2026, again with considerable variability. When confronted with ever-rising costs, employers have to get more creative with the way they offer insurance, or change what is covered. Beyond passing on the entirety of the increase to their employees as higher premiums, employers can redesign the plan, or shift more costs onto the employee. That can mean higher co-pays and deductibles, in addition to higher premiums. “We’re seeing more 20s- and 30-percent increases than we ever have before, in premiums. It’s quite insane,” said Gregory Puig, partner with Sentinel Group and the president of the Massachusetts chapter of the National Association of Benefits and Insurance Professionals. Shifting costs onto employees is not a new strategy. Nearly half of Massachusetts residents with commercial insurance had a high deductible health plan in 2023 — up from 19 percent in 2014, state data show. Average deductibles are also on the rise — from about $2,300 in 2014 to over $3,100 in 2023. Rob DiMase, a partner at Sentinel Group, an employee benefits administration and consulting firm, said these strategies have helped some employers he works with mitigate a 20 percent cost increase for next year, so the employees only see their premiums rise by 10 to 12 percent. Still, some employers are seeing huge increases. In the large group business, which includes employers with 50 to 500 employees, the best initial increase DiMase saw was 7 percent. The worst was around 57 percent. Escalating costs have patients worried about the future. Joe D’Eramo, 61, who has a broker, paid just over $615 monthly this year for coverage through WellSense. Beginning Jan. 1, that premium will increase by $90 per month and his deductible will rise by $500, to $3,500. Advertisement D’Eramo works as a freelance copy editor and public relations specialist, and drives for Uber on the side. But a $1,000 settlement with the ride share company will be wiped out by his health insurance increase. D’Eramo, who lives in Millis, was recently diagnosed with diabetes. He is counting down the years until he qualifies for Medicare, the government insurer that generally serves people 65 and older, so that he can save more money. “I just want to be able to make it to that [while still] healthy,” he said.

Title: Amazon placed him on a PIP. Here's how he bought himself time to find a new job.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When Michael Permana learned that his time as a software engineer at Amazon might be running out, he made an interesting decision: he took paternity leave. In late February 2023, Permana was placed on a PIP. "I was desperate because from what I'd heard, once you are in a performance improvement plan, you are on your way out at Amazon," said the 47-year-old, who lives in Fremont, California. He began applying for jobs right away, but knew it could take a while to land something new. He had a mortgage to pay, so he decided to buy himself roughly two months of breathing room by using the remainder of his paternity leave from when his daughter was born. By temporarily stepping away from work — and the scrutiny that came with being on a PIP — he figured he could prolong his employment at Amazon while he searched for a new role. "I took the opportunity while I could to delay time," he said. Permana is among the Americans who have taken steps to prepare for unemployment in a corporate landscape where, for some, job security feels less dependable than it once did. Business Insider has spoken with dozens of workers laid off by large corporations that are implementing strategic changes — including eliminating management layers, shifting investments toward AI, letting go of underperforming employees, and cutting costs across the board. While some workers had a sense their roles might be eliminated, others said they were caught off guard — pointing to their tenure, clean performance records, and the financial strength of their employers. Permana shared how he landed a new role after a challenging search — and offered advice for others facing performance pressure. When reached for comment, Amazon said that it regularly reviews its performance evaluation process to ensure it best supports the growth and development of its employees. Business Insider has heard from dozens of workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: Rather than simply working hard and hoping for the best, some workers have prepared for the worst — deploying strategies such as applying for jobs before trouble strikes, launching side businesses, or secretly juggling multiple jobs. In Permana's case, at least he had some warning, and paternity leave bought him some time to look for his next gig. That doesn't mean his job search was easy. His two main search strategies were applying to software engineering roles on LinkedIn and exploring opportunities through recruiters he connected with on the platform. Permana landed a few interviews at Meta, Instawork, and HubSpot, but was ultimately rejected from all of them. He said he tried applying to the software company SnapLogic, where he'd worked more than a decade previously, but was denied there as well. "It was very hard," he said, adding that he still has a "collection" of rejection emails he's compiled for tracking purposes. By the time Permana returned from paternity leave in May, he still hadn't landed a new job, and he continued to feel that his performance was under scrutiny. However, he soon advanced in the interview process for a software engineering role at the mobile game developer MobilityWare. A friend who worked there referred him for the position, which he believes helped him get an interview. In late May, Permana received an offer. In June, his tenure at Amazon came to an end, and he began the new role — a remote position that offered the flexibility he was looking for. Permana said he enjoyed the job but recently left for a software engineering role at the mobile messaging platform Attentive, citing higher pay as a key reason for the switch. When it comes to navigating a performance improvement plan, Permana said his best advice is to communicate openly with your manager and focus on doing exactly what they're asking of you. However, he also believes it's wise to assume things might not work out — and to start applying for jobs elsewhere. As for advice on landing a software engineering role, Permana said his two biggest tips are to seek out referrals whenever possible and to dedicate significant time to interview preparation. He recalled that Meta's interview process, for example, included coding questions that required extensive prep. One question, he said, touched on a concept he hadn't thought about in the last two decades of his career. Permana believes the questions were so demanding that it would be difficult for any working professional to find enough time to prepare properly. "You'd have to study for a few months to be able to do those questions," he said. Reviewing questions on LeetCode, a coding interview prep website, helped him prepare for interviews at Meta and elsewhere — but he said it still required a significant time investment. Permana's advice: Find ways to carve out enough time for your job search — even if it doesn't involve taking paternity leave. Jump to

Matthias Niehoff: I'm Matthias. I work for codecentric, a small consultancy in Germany. Before I joined codecentric, I made my professional education in an insurance company. When I finished this education, I came back to the company and they said, congratulations, and yes, we want you to stay with us. We have a new job for you. Back then I was in the architecture team, whatever that meant. The job is going to be in the data warehouse team. I was like, what? Because for me, data is that which the others are doing. From a software engineering perspective, I didn't care about data warehouses. This is where the data goes and they get it some magical way. Turns out it was a joke. I stayed in the architecture team. After joining codecentric, I moved into the data space. I started with Apache Spark 10 years ago, and then evolved into getting all the data stuff, but I have a software engineering background turning data. These challenges remain. From a software engineering perspective, it's often still like data, data, data for analytics, it's not that that we care about. I'll give you an example. Thinking about, we have some data that is stored, order data and order id and quantity, on the right side, we have the analytics side. We just get the order id and the quantity. Then the application thing, we want to track if the order was unfulfilled. The analytics side still doesn't select order id and quantity, and wonders, we have more orders than we had in stock because they didn't know there was an unfulfilled field that they had to track and that has to be selected as well. They're eventually coming up to select this as well, but they want to measure now the unfulfilled items and then they change the data type from a Boolean to an integer. What happens? Either the consuming side converts it implicitly to a Boolean and it basically fails silently, or they just fail implicit because the data type has changed. This is a quite common scenario we have when providing data. What is the reason? The problem is that most of the time only the technical schema is exposed towards the consumers of the data. The consumers just get that schema and try to reverse engineer what is actually happening here. What is the business process that creates that data? What are the constraints here? What is the data model underneath? Also, is this source really trustable? Can I trust it? How do I access it? Is it stable? Is it durable? All these questions remain. It might just be a dump on a file system somewhere more often than not. On the other side, the producers, if they even care who uses the data, they don't often know who uses the data. For what reason? For what purpose? They're most of the time blind on this side. To summarize, most of the time, data is still a second-class citizen, if we're talking about software architectures. It's just a database where we store the data in. This leads to quick one-off solution if data is to provide it, we do dumps. We just say, here, you have a user for our database. You can access it. Nobody would do that normally, but, yes, that's done. The data team is left on its own. I'm going to show you some examples of what we did with clients to manage this. The first example is a small FinTech, which is in the realms of a larger bank in Germany. They were doing B2C stuff, and they wanted to do analysis on marketing campaigns on how the customers behave, what kind of customers they have. They want to check their online sales process. Nothing fancy, just gathering some data from different systems. There was a small team of data analysts who were really curious about getting results out of data, not the really technical guys, all your Python, all your SQL and know how to start a Jupyter Notebook, but they were more interested in, what is the data to say. They had minimal support from the org. The org was really focusing on the application. It was DevOps and software engineers and all this stuff, but they want to just build online applications. They didn't really see the case for data. As a data team, what did we do? We got files, in this case, dumped over at an SFTP server. The first thing we do, we did tests on the source data. In this case we used dbt. We wrote tests to test what is in the data. Does the data change? Is it what we expected, to get notified early if there would be changes in the data? For instance, there would be all null columns, because suddenly would likely mean there was some problem in the export of the data from the source system. We made it visible. We built dashboards. This is elementary build on dbt. It most of the time didn't look like this. This is in the best case. We want to make it really visible. Having this really as a chart where we looked on each day and also using it to communicate with our stakeholders, we don't have the data we needed. Data is broken and so on. We started documenting what we learned about the data. How is data created? What is the business process behind the data? What are the constraints? We learned on the fly, basically, while working with the data. We adjusted the test to actually have the knowledge we had in the test. We extended this. This also was part of dbt in the end. This was all just basically mitigation of the problems. We had mitigation of the problems that the producer actually wanted on board. We wanted to get to the source. We wanted to involve the producers to actually help us getting better data. Maybe it's getting a step back. If you have an application data model where you store your data of the application, you have defined it everywhere. Might be in normal form. Might be normalized or whatever. You have another application wanting to access this. No software engineer on earth would say, here's the application model, just do the access on it. You would always build some API on it. Might be a REST API, might be a stream. You might be putting on messages on AMQP, whatever. You would always use an abstraction. From analytics, it's more often than not like this. You just dump out the internal application model. What we're thinking about is we want to use an API as well. Maybe not the REST API that is optimized for single record access, but maybe some more efficient. Or it might even be a separate data model that has been created for sharing the data towards the outside. All of this should actually be the responsibility of the team. We should care about how those interfaces look like. How should those interfaces look like where we share those data from the team towards the analytics part. The one thing is, how is this sharing data model created? It needs some pipeline. It has to be some process, something where this sharing data model is created. The sharing data model itself, from a technology perspective, could be a view in the same database that they are using for the application. It might be a topic in some broker. It might be files in Blob storage. It might be Iceberg tables, data tables, CSV, whatever. It might be something in a data warehouse or data lake. With the MCP servers now giving LLMs access to data, the first idea is popping up to actually use MCP servers to access those data. I'm not sure if it's a good idea still, but at least something one can have in mind. We need those pipelines so that software developers can easily share this data. These pipelines should be part of the whole application, so owned by the development team. The development team is responsible for creating this data model for sharing the data. First of all, it means more responsibilities, but also it gives you chances. I think a lot of you who work in data know that CI/CD tests and so on are not as widespread as in software engineering. It might be a chance for software development teams to actually build and use their software stack, to use their best practices or good practices that they have, writing tests, doing CI/CD from this. Taking ownership of it means not only responsibility, but also having the freedom to do it in the way they want to implement it. In the same tech stack, possibly. It's just another API that they are building next to maybe an existing REST API. Still, those pipelines need to be supported. We want to support those people with blueprints, with libraries creating this. It might be that the application tech might be Java something or Kotlin or so on. On the data side and on the consumer side where you want to provide the data might be something like a Delta Lake managed by Databricks. I happen to have an example afterwards. You need to do more support for this. You need to do support for execution and retry, something that is not that usual in a normal web application. You have to build frameworks and things for this. You have to enable monitoring with them. Yes, they can use the monitoring that they use for applications, but it might be something different. Schema evolution, write to data-specific infrastructure? Also, things in business, like data changes have to be supported. Those are some of the things they are not used to when writing a normal application. Next example. We have a Java application writing to a Databricks-powered data lake. Most of the developers that would implement this application don't know what Databricks is or know how to use it or how to implement it, and how to do stuff in it. They might be able to do this, writing data to a Blob storage, maybe in Parquet file and not in JSON, or something a little bit more efficient. There are two options, basically. You can register this as an external table in Unity Catalog, or you can load it to Databricks. I won't discuss which one is better, but as a software developer, I just don't care. I don't want to know how to do this. The pipeline should support, actually, this library. We built libraries that made it possible to just say, I have a large amount of data here in some file or in a database, and I want to publish it. The library takes care, with the pipeline behind it, to put the data into a Blob storage, load it to Databricks, make it available there. The SDK or the library had some input fields, so you can do a description in it, you can put information to the data in it, so that it gets published to the Unity Catalog as well. This was just the beginning of the interface we were describing. We started collecting also not only the data, but also information and metadata about it. We took another step forward after this. One thing we used were data contracts. I think most of you have heard of data mesh, a few years old by now. Huge impact, huge hype back then, a lot of different concepts. I think the most tangible concept that was there was the data products, and out of this came the data contracts. Contracts basically describe the data that you're sharing between a data provider that has some data product, in this case it would be the application team, and the data consumer, what data they share, and how it looks like, and what guarantees that gives you. The data contract is then described often as a YAML file, and you can use it for enforcement. I'll come to it later. The most important part is you make it explicit. You explicitly describe, we share or provide this data, and we use it, and they talk to each other, which most of the time didn't happen before. What would a data contract look like? I have here the high-level overview of a data contract on the right side. You have servers. Where's the data stored? Might be in a database, might be in S3 bucket, might be anything, might be a topic. You have the schema of this. You can put price tags on it. If you say consumption costs like this, so you can enforce it, informational only. You give information about who's the team. You give roles. You give SLA properties. We give you the guarantee that this data is up to date, or is updated every day, at maximum lags behind one day after the event has occurred. We give you guarantees that we will do failure resolution of data within whatever days. This is really something that you argue about, and more often than not, coming to points where you're saying, you expect this, now we only can deliver this, because we have this and this constraint on this. Then you find a solution together. We created those contracts data first, so we had the data, and then we started creating a contract, all of the data. You can just say, here's data, just build a contract out of it. We versioned those things with semantic versioning. We put it into a central Git repository. What we used was the Open Data Contract Standard. There are multiple standards, currently it seems like this is the one that evolves from all of those standards, and it's going to be the main standard, until there's another one. We were lucky and did the right choice at this point. I see that we can also enforce those contracts. There's a CLI, datacontract-cli as it's called, where you can test those contracts. You have defined this contract in a YAML file, all the information inside, where's the data stored, what kind of schema do we expect, and we're doing tests on it. We can also do like, do we have breaking changes? If we do another version of the data contract, we can just give the YAML file of the old contract, of the new contract, and say, is this breaking or is it forward compatible? Can we use it again? What we did is, we created source tests. You remember right at the beginning, we manually created source tests, we can create dbt source tests, based on the information we have in our contract, and use those to enforce the data, and test the data as a consumer. Where were we enforcing the contracts in the end? Once on the publisher side, in CI/CD. We changed an API. We created a pull request. Within the pull request, we checked the changes against the contract. We checked for the format, for the schema, for the data quality, is it still what we expected? If all these checks passed, then that was one of the necessary requirements to get those pull requests merged. On the consumer side, on the other side, we also retrieved the data, and the first thing we do, we're checking the data. Checking for schema. Checking for quality. Checking if those SLAs we had agreed on were true. This is what we did there. Where and how did we check for reliability? Because one of the topics is reliability. We did unit tests and tested contracts in the app development. The pipeline execution, we tested against data, and we integrated it into application monitoring, having one view, and not the application monitoring with Grafana and whatever, and some other view somewhere else. We did source tests and tests in further stages along the processing as well. Didn't go into details here. Reliable and trusted data is important to scale the data usage. When I'm talking about scale, I'm not talking about having billions and billions and more data, but with scale, I mean getting more out of the data we have, empowering more use cases, getting more use cases done, creating more value for the business. This is, for me, scale. I don't need the tech scale. It's interesting, but it's not necessarily the most important part. Next to this trusted data, what is the role of tech and platform in this case? We talked about the pipeline getting data, but what is the role of tech and platform? A few people know this. What does it mean when you see this? For me, it's sometimes really a cognitive overload. This is all the tooling and things one should know, or at least have an idea about what they do when it comes to data, and it's getting bigger and bigger. Also, GenAI is included, which is a big part of it, but it's really a lot. For me, sometimes it's really causing constant stress. I just go through LinkedIn or whatever, or Hacker News, and see there's a new tool, and there's something cool, and there's something I want to have to dig in, and it's really like constant stress. What do you do then if you're coming in this thing? There's multiple strategies of what people do. You try to start, I'm looking everywhere. I'm trying to get there. I get an idea there, and so you know nothing about everything, basically. Or another strategy is, that's too much. I just focus on this one and go really deep. I know everything about Apache Spark. I don't care what's left and right, but in Apache Spark, I'm the absolute expert. Or you just say, no, back then, we were just using Apache NiFi example. We can do everything with it. You're just clinging to the past, also a strategy that people are doing. Or you get dogmatic, or you just give up and say, what else? I just don't care. It's definitely this complexity and all these things that might be there, and people are telling you, and market telling you, you need this to get actually data platform, and this is needed, and this is needed. It's unhealthy for people, and it's unhealthy for organizations. A reason why I might come back to something that is essential complexity versus accidental complexity. Essential complexity is the things that you need to fulfill your functional requirements, your non-functional requirement, and there might be some boundary conditions. A lot of you might be in banking, so there are boundary conditions from regulations or whatever that you have to comply to. These are essential complexity. You cannot do this without those complexity. It's inherent to the problem and the essence of the problem that you are solving. All the rest is the accidental complexity. Is using Kubernetes over kubectl really essential to the problem you're solving? Might be, might not be. I tend to say in data, more often than not, it's not the problem. For me, there's a lot of accidental complexity we introduce by using those tooling. Therefore, it's really important to embrace simple and effective solutions to really build things that solve the problems at hand, to scale things. A good strategy to do this is choose boring technologies. Technologies that are well understood, both in what they can do, what they can't do, and what failures might occur. You might find all failures in Stack Overflow, or ChatGPT has learned about them. It's pretty good to understand. You have a community. You have people to talk about. It might be sometimes that a new problem comes up where existing and boring technology doesn't work. One of the most boring technologies, which is pretty good at data, is actually Postgres. It's not as sexy as Snowflake. It's not as fast as DuckDB. Postgres is actually a really good solution for a lot of data cases we have. Also, there's the concept of innovation tokens. A really good idea. There's the idea of, as a team, you have two or three or one innovation token per year that you can spend on new technologies. You try to manage and not to lose yourself into new stuff as well. Next to boring technologies and also Postgres, is you build on well-understood technical foundation and open standards. Open standards give you the flexibility to argue with vendors, to switch things. It's good understanding. There's a foundation to use this. One of the open standards next to Postgres is all the things that come towards data storage right now. Think data storage in the cloud is a lot of getting commodities. If you're using Delta or Iceberg or Parquet, it's open standards. Also, query engines get open standards, and you can build on top of this. Another thing to keep things simple is leveraging the key concept of the cloud. Doing automation. Doing scaling to zero, and reduce the vertical integration. I said, I'm not a big fan of Kubernetes in data because I think there's a lot of good PaaS and SaaS platforms that actually go higher level and enable you to do more with less in the end. This might be something that is very familiar to a lot of software engineers, but you see in the data place, there's a gap between what software engineering knows and what software engineers knows is a good thing, and what data engineering does. Another case, a pretty conservative bank, slow, not that large, regional bank, a cooperative, they want to do more data-driven decisions. Which management doesn't want to do more data-driven decisions? The existing solutions didn't scale, not in terms of data, but scale in terms of what decisions we can make, what kind of insights do we get? They built a cloud data platform. They use a central team for the platform, no data mesh, but they have different data user teams that actually use those platforms. What we built is we used open standards. A platform in the cloud, in this case, it's Azure, but it could be any cloud, using Delta Lake as an open standard for software, using PySpark, which is an open-source product to run their data. Nobody wants to run PySpark on its cluster on its own. You never want to do this. We used Databricks. We used the Unity Catalog, which is proprietary stuff, yes, but it gives us things that we didn't get about any standards, gives us things about permissions, management. It's not the business data catalog, it's a technical data catalog. We're using Databricks Serverless SQL to access that data. Those are proprietary things, but the foundations are open source and open standards. We used also the Unity Catalog features to provide the data towards, I said, we had a core team and multiple single teams as well. We had the core team having catalogs, and those can be shared within other teams. We're using the Unity Catalog features of Databricks with it. If you're building things like these, on Kubernetes, you have to find a solution where you can do the cataloging. The Unity Catalog is open source. I've not seen a lot of companies actually running it. You want to get it managed because you won't get paid for running in catalog most of the time. We use the catalogs for data sharing between those departments. This was proprietary stuff, yes, but built on open foundation. Those open foundations enabled us, for instance, to use different query engines. Databricks is a great platform. I really like it. Other platforms might be good as well. I'm not that experienced with it. If you are coming to data that is not huge, but it's big, like 30 gigs, 40 gigs, or whatever, Spark is actually really slow. It's a lot of overhead to actually process the data. Thanks to the open standard, we could use DuckDB to connect that data. We can get a token from Unity Catalog and read the data from the Delta Lake. It's an open catalog. It's an open standard, nothing proprietary. Because one thing, data is smaller than you might think. This is an analysis of Amazon Redshift. The team behind Amazon Redshift did it. It's a few months old already. This is the title, Why TPC Is Not Enough. TPC is a benchmark used in analytics to measure the speed of warehouses and SQL engines. The paper was about, is TPC still the right benchmark? They analyzed all the data they have in their system and they found out, actually most of the data, so we have the rowcount buckets up to 10 million rows over here. Ten million rows isn't that much on data, but most of the data actually is about 10 million rows. It's not that big. Sometimes it's even enough to run on a single machine. You don't need distributed systems at all, making it simpler, easier, more cost-effective, and more reliable to build data platforms. Another example, we built a more small stack, FinTech. We want to do everything on-prem. There were some reasons to do this. We just built things on Postgres with dbt and Airflow to orchestrate. One can argue if Airflow is a bit of overkill, yes. We use Python to ingest the data. We use the contracts before to actually synchronize on the data and have a clear interface between this. It was really simple tech, nothing fancy, but it gets the job done. One thing I want to give you, apply software engineering best practices. I'm on a more or less software engineering conference for you as clients, writing tests for code and data, monitoring and observability, infrastructure as code. It's all a given, but it isn't too much in the data world, actually. It's a hard way to say, tests are a benefit. You also have to understand, yes, some things are definitely different. Data gives you another dimension. The data itself is another dimension you have to test as well, using separate environments. Also thinking that software engineers say, of course I use separate environments. In data, it more often than not comes to this. Separate environments is often like, yes, we have prod. Bringing it together, reducing the complexity of the platform also reduces the error surface. Reducing complexity reduces costs. All in all, this improves reliability of your data platform, data pipelines. Then using standards, improving practices, simplifies the operation, also less complexity, less overhead, and sometimes a single node system can bring you a long way. We talked about having the pipelines and contracts basically in the platform and say it's simplifying. Maybe take one step further here. Another idea I just want to present and give out. Another case, an industrial IoT startup. They collected sensor data in their electronic grid and they visualized that data. Eventually, they also want to control the grid based on the data. What they did is they had a document database, put all the data into the document database. The team was consisting mostly of full stack developers and mostly heavily leaning to the TypeScript and the ecosystem around this. Then, a document database is fine, because if you're building a frontend with TypeScript, all the data is in JSON, perfect. At some point, they started wanting to do data analysis. What we had were like this. We had an ingest. The data was put into a document database. There was a UI and APIs connected to the document database, and there was a relational database for some master data. What stations did we have? What centers did we have out in the field? Pretty common. Document database was also using the time series mode of those databases. Then they wanted to add aggregations on this, because they wanted to do hourly and daily values, so they did a Python script that runs on Document DB, then they wanted to have alerts running on the Document DB, getting the data out of it. The relational database was extended somehow because they wanted to do analytics. The center of the data was actually Document DB. To summarize this, this was actually a web application that is a data platform with a UI. It's not a web application, but the center of this application is data. We built a UI on it, but it's not a UI and data is somewhere. We redesigned it. We have the ingest, and the first place where the data lands is the data platform. We don't have any application doing anything, but we have the data platform, the one that is responsible for storing, analyzing the data. We do all the aggregation and the alerting on this data platform. Then we have the Document DB that is fed from the data platform with the data that is needed to visualize the data. It might be aggregated. It might be filtered. It might be optimized to actually fit the needs of visualization. We had data analytics directly on the data platform. What we did basically is a shift left. Shift left is like everywhere. Shift left in security is more about having it earlier in the process, in designing as well. We have to shift left in the data flows, not too much in the process of creating the software. There might be ideas as well, but in the shift left in data flow. We had from data source to application to doing some ETL and ELT stuff to doing it somewhere where we do analytics. We moved it to, we're having a data platform. Some optional ETL, ELT might be, might not be. Depends on what data platform you have. You don't have to load the data. You might access the data platform directly. Then connected some analytics stuff, some web application where a user can do something. I'm not saying this should be done for all, definitely not. I think especially for applications where the data is in the center, and I see it a lot in IoT and industrial applications where you get a lot of sensor data or also in marketing where you get tracking data. This might actually make sense to move data at the center and not treating this like an application. We moved the data lake. When we think about this, we can even take it one step further. Why do we actually build different platforms for data and applications? There was a talk about platform engineer basically and developer experience. It was a lot about building applications for software engineers with all the CI/CD and the golden path and improving the developer experience, making it easy to deploy stuff. It's all good and all fine. What we end up with, we have an application platform where we run all the applications on it. We have a data platform, which is storing the data and powering ML and AI use cases, BI use cases. Taking observability, for instance. Observability is a huge thing in application platforms. Monitoring, logs, all the stuff is built into it. We would definitely need more of this in data platforms. There is a lot of things that can be used. Most of the time, the data platform solves it itself. I take an example, Databricks. Getting data out of Databricks for monitoring and observability reasons is possible, but definitely not easy to do. It's completely two separate subsystems with different approaches, with different technologies. I don't think it has to be like this. This is actually also widening the gap between those systems, because we're building on different platforms and different paradigms, and try to avoid this. We use the data platform, getting the data from the data management. Why don't we build application and data platforms? Platforms that actually have in mind from the beginning, we want to support application development, running applications, and using the data within this application for analytical purposes. We have things like storage and runtime. The storage might be different for data than for applications. The runtime might be different, but it comes from one vision, might not be one team, but from one platform building this. Everything that is CI/CD means there are proven patterns on how to do CI/CD in every software company, most likely. I think 80% of the time those can be reused for data. Why not provide it to data within a data platform as well? All the stuff like secret management. Secret management, there's a lot of tooling around it, but it's reinvented in data as well. Test data management, and the contracts themselves. The contracts are in between application and data. This is what is common to both, and of course should be managed within this platform itself. You might be asking, what is the tech? There isn't the one technology that powers all of this. You might say, yes, we built everything on Kubernetes because we built our developer platform and our data platform on Kubernetes. One might say Databricks or Snowflake or whatever might be your thing. I would say, coming back to what I said was platforms, we did think about what is the essential complexity? What is the accidental complexity? What complexity is actually needed to solve this? It might be that Kubernetes is one thing. It might be that Kubernetes powers all of your cases and all the things that you have also with data. It might be that you have two different technologies and just creating good bridges in between and good integrations in between. It might be that there's even another solution based on this. There isn't the one answer. I promised I'm coming back to DuckDB as well. It's an idea of DuckDB not seeing this, but I think it's a good thing to think about is going beyond two-tier data architectures. The two-tier data architecture is basically this. We have data in the application. We have data in the analytics part. This is an idea of DuckDB. DuckDB, pretty fast embedded analytical query engine and database, which can basically run everywhere on a server or in a browser with Wasm, or in a Lambda function, and can read basically everywhere. Having the central data lake, in this case it's more like a swamp maybe, or between a lake and a swamp, as a central datastore, both powering applications and analytics on the same way. It's an idea. We haven't seen this in a project. I think it's an idea worth thinking about, maybe having in mind when designing this. Because, in my opinion, it would be a good thing when data and applications became one. We would have less friction between operational and analytics: common ground, common platform, common ideas maybe to build stuff. We could actually define and encapsulate responsibilities more clearly. Remember the example from the IoT startup? There was a long discussion. Who should do the aggregation? Who is responsible for doing the other thing? Is it the application or is it the data team? Where is the knowledge about when to do the other thing? If you're thinking this is one, then it's a common ground you find and you can decide together where it is. You might have optimized data representations for different cases. A document database isn't that good actually for analytics. There might be better settings, but it's really good for UIs, for example. The same is a Blob storage isn't that good for actually real-time requests from a web UI, but a document database would be. It's really important to use the tooling on both sides. Not saying, we have Kubernetes and Postgres and everything, so just get started with this and do this, but to know the stringencies, the differences that there are. Also, use the engineering best practices and good practices, and apply them to data. What do we take away from this? The first thing, validate and monitor your data early on. Having contracts both from the provider side, and do it on the consumer side as well. Start at the source. Really take the devs into this. Don't say, we just get the data and we have to be on our own. Try to get the devs on board by building solutions and abstractions that actually have them, that make it easy for them. Don't say to them, here's Databricks, publish it there. You can build workflows there. You just need to write Python and write it to Parquet. No, that's not going to work. Really get to the devs and get them where they are, and address those pains. Of course, the organization has to prioritize data as well, otherwise every product owner of every team would just say data, data, I don't care. Simplify the architecture. Don't make it more complex. Really make it handleable, also for smaller teams, for teams that are not that experienced. It doesn't have to be the latest, newest technology everywhere. Apply the good practices you know from software engineering. It might be a thing to think data and application platform together, not separate those worlds from the beginning, from the foundation. It's getting split up in the application anyway and in the usage, but maybe having a common ground to actually build on them. We talk a lot about tech now. Actually, data modeling is really a thing. Only write tables and having everything joined and having one large table might not be sufficient all the time. Things like star schema, dimensional modeling, all this stuff isn't the sexy part, but it's actually really helpful. Besides all the tech, there's also some things to learn from data and good classic data warehouse. Although, sometimes it's really dry, but it's helpful. Nardon: Your take on using the data for application and for the operational system using the same platform. Usually, in companies, especially when you have several departments, you have teams that need data from other departments. Usually, that's why there's a data platform where you can advertise your data and share data with other teams. If you're using the same platform for data and applications, this gets a little more complex, because you have the teams developing the data and having to share. How are you doing a data mesh architecture and sharing data between departments if you're using the same architecture? Matthias Niehoff: Even when you build the same platform for application and data, I would still have those typical data platform capabilities like having a catalog and having access management to different data, and a point where data is shared towards others. It would be still a capability that should be built into this application and data platform, definitely. It's not like we don't have the traditional data platform anymore with all the functions. We still have those functions, just moved to one platform that is developed under one common vision with one common ground and one common goal. I'm pretty sure in a large organization, it won't be one team building this platform as well. What's more interesting is, often it's like the data department, especially in classical environments, somewhere in finance and the CFO might be the boss and the application platform is in CDO, CTO, CIO department, and it's completely different areas of the organization with different cultures as well. This is more like a tricky thing I see that would hinder adoption of this. Yes, definitely. Participant 1: How do you know when you should start buying a tool instead of building on your own? Because a lot of the other talks so far have said that you should buy before you build, but you say to choose boring tech. At what point do you know that you should switch to buying existing software? Matthias Niehoff: Boring tech doesn't mean you shouldn't buy. Postgres, ok, you don't buy Postgres, but you could buy Databricks with PySpark, and PySpark is boring tech. It depends. When you're doing stuff that you have the feeling of, it may mean you could take Wardley Maps or something to get out what is commodity, what is actually new, in genesis. If you're building stuff that is undifferentiated heavy lifting, things you do that don't provide really value to you, running a Kubernetes cluster as a data team, I would take as an example. Then you think about, might there be something that would reduce the vertical integration that gives us more intermediate ways to do things with data, work with data. I don't have one person that actually only is there to run the Kubernetes cluster. I think this would be a thing. It's not like there's this one idea to do this. This is more like, depends on your situation. Participant 2: I think my question is around the complexities of having a platform that has already been adopted or consumed by multiple data teams. How easy is it actually to change technology? I think I'm asking this because we're moving in a world where technologies are released every day. We see that there's a Microsoft Fabric that's been introduced now to say that it's also removing the complexities around infrastructure. How do you actually manage that? Because we are also in a distributed type of mesh, and data teams are actually responsible for their own tech. How do you ensure that all those principles can actually be a central component? Matthias Niehoff: When you were changing tech, what would be the motivation, would be the question? Why would you choose changing the tech? Just to standardize, and all of them having the same technology? That wouldn't be enough as an argument to just change tech. If you say, we have to standardize because we have increasing license costs because everybody has bought their own tooling and so on, yes, then it's more or less a classical migration and modernization project with a clear path on how to move each of those teams to a central technology or a central platform. You still want to have distributed responsibilities, I understand, so teams are responsible for the data, but they should use common infrastructure. It's more like a normal modernization project. Participant 3: You commented that running the same data platform for applications as well as, let's say, analytics is not something you've seen much of. I'm aware of a few that run, Uber, us, and usually the complexity is around non-functionals. There are two patterns I know, which is running multiple concurrent versions of the same platform optimized for different non-functionals, and the one we're attempting, which is to use the same platform overlaying the tooling on the same source. You keep talking about DuckDB and these tools. Given those two paradigms, do you have a thought as which one you think would be more efficient, profitable, functional? Matthias Niehoff: You mean by having one platform or having separate platforms? Participant 3: One platform with three different copies of the data optimized for the different non-functional use cases or one version of the data platform that then has to support optimizing for different use cases. Matthias Niehoff: Yes, either optimizing the data or optimizing the processing, is basically the question. Participant 3: For me, the question is usually around the idea of overlaying tooling, so different interfaces, query products. Matthias Niehoff: It depends a bit. For instance, if you're taking a database as your storage, then you have the query engine baked in. Then you can't change too much. If you say my data is stored in a Blob storage underneath and I just use a different engine, then you would be flexible, of course. I think then flexibility actually pays off and it would go that way. It depends a lot on how you store it, but you made one good point. This distinction between having storage and query engine directly coupled goes more and more away. We have the storage that is often pretty cheap as a Blob storage, and we have query engines that optimize for different use cases, definitely.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Cyber Monday is here, and there are lots of deals to choose from, including these excellent discounts on the Apple products we recommend: Today’s best Apple deals: U.S. Today’s best Apple deals: U.K. Updated December 1: We have reviewed the best prices and found more price drops and changes. We will be regularly monitoring the best prices and will update this article throughout Cyber Monday. ‘Tis the season for savings! Whether you’re looking for a deal on an iPad, Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods, or anything else Apple sells, there’s no better time to get one for cheap than Black Friday. The annual shopping extravaganza officially kicked off on Friday, but many of the best deals will last until today, AKA Cyber Monday on December 1. Every retailer that sells Apple gear gets in on the fun, and we are rounding up only the best deals we find right here. We regularly check prices using various tools to get a view of the very best prices right now, compared to what they were over the past days, weeks, and months, so we know an excellent deal when we see it. We’re checking and updating these prices all weekend, so mark this page and return often so you don’t miss a good deal, some of which are short-lived. Even Apple runs its own Black Friday shopping event, where it offers gift cards on certain purchases, including $50 with AirPods Pro 3, $100 for iPad Air, and $250 with a MacBook Pro. The bottom line is that there are lots of deals to be found right now, so no matter what Apple device you’re looking for, you will be able to make a saving. So take a look at the deals on all of Apple’s products below. Also, check our Best Picks round-ups, where you can find reviews of all the products we recommend. At Macworld we’ve been covering and reviewing Apple and Apple devices for more than 40 years, from the original Macintosh to the most recent M5 MacBook Pro and iPhone 17 lineup. We use Apple products every day and purchase them with our own money, so we know a good deal when we see one. More importantly, we also know how to spot a bad deal. With a working knowledge of everything Apple sells and decades of experience, we know when stores are inflating prices or pushing “normal” sales as limited Black Friday deals, so the listings you see here will only be for discounts that are at or near all-time low prices. Macworld Cyber Monday tip: While shopping during the Black Friday sales, we’ve noticed that on Amazon, if you delay your delivery date, there are additional 2-3% savings to be had. This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart, then it can add up to decent savings. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than last Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $150 off it’s a good saving (but it was $200 earlier in the Black Friday sale). We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 did dip as low as $139 at Walmart, but that deal seems to have ended now, the next best option is $189 on Amazon. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 was superb, but stock seems to have run out now (check to see if the model is user). You can still get AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation for less than $100, which is an excellent deal. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that AirPods deals sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers can save money on the AirPods Pro 2, currently at £169 with Argos, but we’ve also seen them at that price on Amazon (but they go out of stock quickly!). Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’ve seen $150 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. The standard entry-level iPad A16 is an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $275, but stock is dwindling, so if you want one act fast. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) (which has run out now) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Cyber Monday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or £74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 off/£20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats. You might also find some deals among our best earbuds for iPhones and Best over-ear headphones. U.S. U.K. Apple holds a shopping event every Black Friday, but it doesn’t offer actual discounts. Instead, Apple gives away gift cards when you buy certain products, which can be used on a future purchase. In 2025, Apple is offering the following gift card values over Black Friday weekend: This years deal is better than last year’s, with a maximum of $250/£200 being given away in the form of gift vouchers, and in some cases, such as the iPhones, we are seeing better savings via Apple than elsewhere.

Head here for the Discovery menu (€80), from brioche and langoustine to rabbit and chocolate caramel. Award-winning wine bar with 250 bottles, 100 wines by the glass and sharp local plates, made for nights with friends. Chef Sidjy and sommelier Colin serve French cooking with changing menus for brunch, lunch and dinner, matched with French wines, cocktails or coffee in a warm, relaxed setting. In a diningroom with sweeping views of the Burren, head chef Jonathan Farrell serves a €110 five-course menu where technique and skill run through every plate – from finely balanced mackerel tartare with gooseberries to seasonal duck with garden produce. [ Vada restaurant review: Dublin could do with a dozen more brilliant local places like thisOpens in new window ] A Mediterranean-inspired neighbourhood gastropub where smoked cod tarama, crisp broccoli fritti and chicken-pancetta meatballs lead to a standout brown butter miso tart. Start with pasta such as linguine pomodoro, share the suckling pig shoulder al forno for two (€68), and finish with tiramisu. At Conway’s in Blackrock, Elena Segura and Sebastian Sainz serve tins of seafood with focaccia and crisps, oysters from Woodstown to Cromane, and a crisp calamari taco, backed by a sharp low-intervention wine list by the glass. A menu for sharing that runs from oysters and sardines to croquettes and empanadas, with bigger plates such as fig tempura, day-boat fish and a rib of beef for two. Open from Friday to Sunday for lunch, with a seasonal supper club on weekend evenings.

Avalanche (AVAX) is back in the spotlight after reclaiming its position among the top 20 cryptos to surpass Hedera (HBAR), just as Securitize secures EU approval to launch the region’s first fully regulated blockchain-based securities market on the Avalanche network. This convergence of regulatory momentum, institutional adoption, and renewed technical strength has positioned AVAX for a potential market revival heading into 2026. Securitize received regulatory authorization from Spain’s National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) to operate a tokenized trading and settlement system under the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime. The approval enables Securitize to passport the license across the European Single Market, including France, Germany, and Italy, creating an unprecedented bridge between its U.S. broker-dealer operations and Europe’s capital markets. The firm confirmed that the entire infrastructure will run on the Avalanche blockchain, citing sub-second finality, regulatory-grade network performance, and scalable architecture. This move positions Avalanche at the center of institutional tokenization just as Securitize prepares for a $1.25 billion SPAC merger and expands its portfolio, including managing the now-over $1 billion BlackRock BUIDL on-chain treasury fund. The first EU-compliant issuance is slated for early 2026, opening the door for a wave of regulated tokenized assets, an estimated $18 trillion market by 2033. While fundamentals surge, AVAX’s price remains compressed near the long-term support zone around $12–$15. The token recently bounced to $14.94, posting a 6.5% daily gain and breaking above its 7-day moving average at $13.96. It now faces a technical showdown with resistance at the 20-day SMA at $15.21. Momentum indicators are turning constructive. RSI sits at a healthy 42, MACD shows bullish divergence, and Stochastic momentum favors buyers. A breakout above $15.21 could open the path toward $18.61, with a larger target near $33 if long-term trendlines snap. However, failure to hold above $13.91 risks retesting deeper support near $12.57. Fueling optimism, AVAX One Treasury recently accumulated over 9.37 million AVAX, spending $110 million between November 5 and 23. Total reserves now exceed 13.8 million AVAX, signaling robust long-term institutional confidence. On-chain metrics support the bullish case. Deployed contracts are rising, developer activity is expanding, and futures taker data shows increasing buyer dominance. These combined forces suggest that AVAX may be carving out a medium-term bottom. As institutional momentum builds and Europe’s first regulated blockchain securities market goes live on Avalanche, AVAX’s comeback narrative is gaining traction—and a trend reversal may be closer than the charts imply.

Title: Amundi brings euro money market fund onchain with first tokenized share

The asset manager’s hybrid rollout enables investors to choose between the traditional fund and a new blockchain-based version recorded on Ethereum. Amundi, Europe’s largest asset manager, has introduced its first tokenized share class for a euro money market fund. The fund is now offered in a hybrid structure, allowing investors to choose between the traditional version and the new blockchain-based one. The first transaction was recorded on the Ethereum network on Nov. 4. The rollout was developed in collaboration with CACEIS, a European asset-servicing group that provided the tokenization infrastructure, investor wallets, and the digital order system used to process subscriptions and redemptions. According to the companies, tokenizing the fund streamlines order processing, widens access to new investor channels, and enables 24/7 trading. Amundi said the fund holds short-term, high-quality euro-denominated debt, primarily comprising money-market instruments and overnight repurchase agreements with European sovereigns. According to the company’s website, it manages about 2.3 trillion euros ($2.6 trillion) in assets and serves more than 100 million retail clients. Amundi is based in Paris, France.

RWA.xyz data shows BlackRock’s onchain money market product currently holds $2.3 billion in tokenized assets, while Franklin Templeton’s money market fund has more than $826 million in assets. Both funds have been expanding across multiple blockchains. On Nov. 12, Franklin Templeton announced that its tokenization platform joined the Canton Network, enabling its money market fund to operate within a permissioned ecosystem built for financial institutions. BlackRock has also expanded its tokenized fund beyond Ethereum, adding support for Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism and Polygon. A Bank for International Settlements bulletin released on Wednesday noted that tokenized money market funds had climbed to $9 billion in value by the end of October, up from about $770 million at the end of 2023. However, the report warned that the growing adoption of tokenized Treasury portfolios as collateral could expose the financial system to new operational and liquidity vulnerabilities.

Title: Recovery In Sight? Charles Hoskinson Sees Bitcoin Reaching $250,000 By 2026
URL: https://zycrypto.com/recovery-in-sight-charles-hoskinson-sees-bitcoin-reaching-250000-by-2026/

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has offered a ray of hope to Bitcoin (BTC) holders, tipping the cryptocurrency to recover its yearly losses and set a new all-time high. Hoskinson noted that an imminent Bitcoin rally will send prices all the way to $250,000 before the end of next year. According to a recent interview, Hoskinson revealed that Bitcoin is primed for a recovery run that will see the asset recoup its recent losses in the coming months. The Cardano co-founder disclosed that the largest cryptocurrency is only facing short-term downsides due to macroeconomic pressures. Hoskinson argued that the Bitcoin price has been adversely impacted by Trump tariffs and other macroeconomic uncertainties, noting that “crypto is not immune to the macro.” Since October, Bitcoin price has tumbled from its peak of over $126,000 to trade below the $90,000 mark, erasing all its yearly gains. Despite the jarring price drops, Hoskinson is eyeing a meteoric rally for Bitcoin “over the next two quarters.” Furthermore, the outspoken Cardano founder tipped Bitcoin to reach $250,000 by the end of the year, defying claims of an extended rally. Hoskinson clarified that institutions will lead the incoming bull run, unlike previous retail-led bull markets. He pointed to Wall Street’s growing participation in the ecosystem, with BlackRock, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and the US government scrambling to accumulate Bitcoin. Apart from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and frenetic adoption by treasury companies, Hoskinson hinged his bullish estimates on the steady rise of stablecoins and tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). Hoskinson revealed that retail will still play a key role in the anticipated bull run, with the number of cryptocurrency holders predicted to climb to 1 billion. “The fundamentals are just sound. There is no way for this market to stay depressed forever,” said Hoskinson. They are just reflecting their current macro environment.” Previously, Charles Hoskinson tipped Bitcoin to climb to $1 million but did not disclose a timeline for the milestone. Meanwhile, several experts have made bold calls for Bitcoin’s end-of-year price, with the average at $150,000. However, recent price performance has put a dent in end-of-year predictions, with BTC threatening to fall below $85K. While Bitcoin continues its decline, other cryptocurrencies are also facing a torrid patch with Ethereum and XRP wallowing below $3,000 and $2, respectively. BNB, SOL, and DOGE have recorded losses of over 5% over the last day, while Cardano’s ADA tumbled by nearly 8% in the same timeframe. Meanwhile, CoinMarketCap data indicates that the global cryptocurrency market capitalization has surged by 2.44% to settle at $3.12 trillion.

Title: Goldman Sachs flags 'growing signs of weakness' in the US jobs market as layoffs mount

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Goldman Sachs researchers are warning that the US labor market may be starting to soften as private-sector data show a growing wave of layoffs across several industries, the Wall Street bank said in a new report. The firm said state filings related to planned mass layoffs have surged to their highest level since 2016, excluding the pandemic spike — the sharpest increase Goldman has tracked in nearly a decade. Layoff announcements compiled by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a firm that tracks corporate job cuts, had by October climbed to a level previously unseen outside of a recession, the report noted, citing cuts in sectors like tech, industrial goods, and food and beverage as factors that drove the increase. Goldman's economists said the combination of rising layoff signals is concerning — representing "growing signs of weakness" — because workers are increasingly struggling to secure new employment, making rebounding after losing a paycheck especially difficult. Even some of corporate America's biggest names haven't evaded the job market's cooling. Amazon, for example, announced plans this fall to eliminate about 14,000 corporate jobs as it seeks to streamline and embrace AI. "A sustained increase in layoffs would be particularly concerning because the hiring rate for workers is low and it is harder than usual for the unemployed to find jobs," economists Manuel Abecasis and Pierfrancesco Mei wrote. The state filings Goldman cited — known as Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, notices — are required by companies with more than 100 employees in advance of instituting layoffs. They're a helpful indicator of employer behavior, signaling when cuts may be around the corner. On top of the rise in WARN notices, the bank found that the leadership of more publicly traded companies had begun openly discussing potential layoffs on recent earnings calls with shareholders. Taken together with the Challenger outplacement data, the picture strongly suggests more companies are considering trims and efficiencies in the coming months. Still, the bank said weekly jobless claims remain low, which means government reports might not yet reflect the full extent of deterioration in the labor market. A recent Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs report for September surpassed economists' expectations. But Goldman noted that claims tend to lag private layoff trackers by about two months, which could hint at a potential uptick in federal data about job losses as winter continues. And although concerns have grown about whether artificial intelligence is pushing companies to reduce headcount, Goldman said current evidence does not show that AI is meaningfully driving the latest layoffs. "While AI may be increasingly considered in workforce decisions," the Goldman researchers wrote, "clear evidence of layoffs directly motivated by AI remains limited." Jump to

Title: Bitwise CEO Praises XRP ETF Performance Amid Record-Setting Inflows, Here Are The Numbers
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-etf-performance-record/
Time Published: 2025-11-27T16:30:28Z
Full Content:
The launch of XRP exchange-traded funds has quickly turned into one of the strongest openings the crypto ETF market has seen this year. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley publicly celebrated the early success of his firm’s product, pointing to a surge in investor interest that has driven inflows to nine figures in a couple of days. His comments come at a time when total XRP ETF inflows across the industry are climbing, whereas Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are finding it difficult to maintain the same level of demand they had in the past. The Bitwise Spot XRP ETF started trading on November 20 after going live based on the new fast-track SEC guidelines for launching ETFs. Since then, the ETF has witnessed consistent days of inflows. Horsley revealed that the Bitwise XRP ETF recently recorded roughly $18 million of inflows in one trading session. This huge amount is one of the fund’s strongest days yet and demonstrates that institutional investors are taking active positions rather than waiting on the sidelines. The CEO emphasized gratitude to those allocating capital to Bitwise’s product, describing the inflow strength as a sign of confidence in both XRP as an asset and Bitwise as a manager. “Grateful to investors entrusting Bitwise to steward their asset,” he said. The timing of these inflows also shows the bullish momentum across XRP ETFs, with multiple issuers reporting consistent interest since regulatory approval. This is interesting, considering the spot price of the altcoin has been going through a not-so-favorable period in November. According to Horsley, the Bitwise XRP ETF has now attracted approximately $135 million in inflows over its first three days of trading. This pace places it among the fastest-growing altcoin ETFs launched in the United States, although still behind early-stage numbers associated with Bitcoin or Ethereum products. These inflow numbers show the pent-up demand for institutional-grade exposure to the cryptocurrency. In addition to Bitwise, industry-wide XRP ETF data shows that the new products collectively brought in about $164 million on Monday, October 24. In total, the four US-based ETFs have witnessed $643.92 million in inflows since launch, with no day of outflow yet to be recorded. The strong early adoption contrasts sharply with the hesitation seen among some heavyweight ETF issuers. Firms like BlackRock and FIdelity are yet to launch their own version of a Spot XRP ETF, leaving the current wave of inflows to be dominated by Bitwise, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton. Their absence has not stopped the momentum flowing into XRP, though it has kept the scale of inflows below what it could become once the larger issuers eventually join the field.

Title: Dublin Airport warns of delays as taxi drivers to stage protest this evening

Dublin Stock image Dublin Airport has warned passengers of possible delays this evening as taxi drivers are set to stage a protest across the city. In a passenger advisory issued this afternoon, the airport said the demonstration due to take place between 4.30pm and 6.30pm, may lead to “heavier than usual” congestion on roads approaching Dublin Airport. “Some delays are possible,” it warned, advising those with flights to give themselves “plenty of time” for their journey. Airport Police will work alongside gardaí and local authority traffic management teams in an effort to minimise disruption for passengers and staff. The protest comes amid an escalating dispute between taxi drivers and Uber over the company’s recently introduced fixed-fare option, which drivers claim undermines the regulated fare structure set by the National Transport Authority. Uber recently introduced the optional fixed-price model, guaranteeing passengers a maximum fare upfront instead of the usual estimated range that can rise with traffic or route changes. Organisers have said that they “sincerely apologise” for disruption but insisted the protest is necessary. Some 1,500 taxi drivers are set to engage in a ‘slow drive’ at three points including Dublin Airport, Clontarf, and Phoenix Park, from 4.30pm this evening, before converging on Government Buildings. Stock image Today's News in 90 Seconds - Thursday, November 27 It marks a second round of protests following demonstrations outside Leinster House last Saturday, with today’s protests sparked by the reported failure of the Government to meet a talks ultimatum by Monday evening. The company says it will reduce “meter anxiety”, and passengers will still pay the lower amount if the meter comes in under the fixed price. Taxi drivers are also asking Dublin Airport to stop facilitating Uber at the airport, saying that the introduction of fixed fares will have a “detrimental” impact on their livelihoods. Driver representatives say the model leaves many earning less during heavy traffic and have warned that further action is likely unless the issue is addressed. Taxi drivers fear other app operators will follow Uber’s lead in introducing fixed fares, ultimately weakening the role of the meter and increasing dependency on platform-controlled pricing. The NTA has been criticised by drivers for not intervening in the dispute to date. The authority has previously said that taxi fares are set under its regulatory framework and that operators must comply with those rules. The NTA has been contacted for comment. A high-visibility policing operation ­effective in Dublin will be rolled out in other cities and large towns, after a large drop in street crime was recorded.

Title: The Only 3 Ways to Actually Make Money in B2B AI (And Why “AI-Enhanced” Doesn’t Count Anymore)

by Jason Lemkin | Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blog Posts, SaaStr.Ai Most B2B companies claiming to be “AI-powered” aren’t seeing growth accelerate. Not because their technology doesn’t work, but because they’re playing the wrong game entirely. Path 1: Attach to Compute Infrastructure Path 2: Replace Human Headcount Path 3: Massively Displace an Incumbent Everything else is noise in AI and B2B. Let’s break down why each works, how to know if you’re actually doing it, and where most companies go wrong. DataDog’s 23% stock surge after earnings wasn’t luck. It was the inevitable result of a simple principle: sell to the people building AI, and as they grow, you grow automatically. “The AI leaders, the hyperscalers — they’re starting to buy like classic B2B companies,” Jason explains. “They’re recycling the same people in procurement. So if you’re attached to AI budget and you’re a DataDog era, you’re actually going to have a great 2026.” Rory adds critical context: “DataDog is a core piece of compute infrastructure and these hyperscalers are the most compute-intensive companies that have ever been known. If you’re selling compute stuff, you should be having a great quarter. If you’re selling routers, switches, interconnects, whatever it takes to stand up Stargate — you’re going to be golden.” The hyperscalers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, Meta) are deploying unprecedented amounts of compute. They’re not just buying different things — they’re buying MORE of everything: Here’s the key insight: These companies buy like traditional B2B enterprises, just at 10x the scale and 10x the speed. OpenAI isn’t some mystical different creature when it comes to procurement. They need observability. They need security. They need data tools. They need all the same infrastructure any rapidly-scaling company needs — they just need more of it because they’re deploying more compute than any companies in history. Ask yourself these questions: If you can’t answer yes to at least 2-3 of these, you’re not actually playing the compute infrastructure game. Jason’s prediction: “If you have attached to AI budget and you’re a DataDog era, you’re actually going to have a great 2026.” Why? Because the infrastructure layer is just getting started. The capex spend on AI is still accelerating. Data center buildouts are still in early innings. The hyperscalers are still ramping their compute deployments. Every single piece of software that sits in that stack — from chip to model to deployment — is going to see explosive growth. But you need to actually be IN that stack, not adjacent to it. Here’s where companies get confused. They think, “We help AI companies be more productive, so we’re attached to AI.” No. That’s not the same thing. Compute-attached means your revenue scales automatically with compute deployment. It means you’re essential infrastructure, not a productivity enhancer. It means when Stargate comes online with $100B of compute, your revenue goes up whether you do anything or not. If you’re a project management tool that AI companies use, you’re not compute-attached. You’re just selling to hot companies. That’s fine, but don’t confuse it with the DataDog playbook. “Where are you replacing humans for real?” Jason asks. “Where are you going to go in and reduce the headcount that vendor needs by half?” This is the path most companies claim to be on but aren’t actually delivering. The difference between real human replacement and “AI-enhanced productivity” is stark. Jason runs through his experience deploying 20+ AI agents at SaaStr: “We have Reply for Replit (we call it ‘Reply’). We have RD for Artisan which is an SDR. We have Quali for Qualified. They all have these little desks where there’s no human at it anymore.” But here’s the critical distinction he makes about Replit’s V3 agent: “It is the first one that jumped the line to not being one of the parts of our team, but literally being part of our team just like a human being.” What makes it different? It’s sufficiently autonomous, knowledgeable and powerful to complete material high-value tasks on its own with some daily discussions just like on our team. Not “it helps us be more efficient.” Not “it automates some tasks.” It completes high-value work autonomously with the same level of oversight you’d give a human team member. Jason makes a crucial point: “Most of the time, ‘replacing humans’ is a story.” Here’s how to know if you’re actually replacing humans versus just telling yourself you are: Real Human Replacement: Fake Human Replacement (productivity story): Jason walks through how Gamma could evolve from Path 3 (displacement) to Path 2 (replacement): “When Gamma can do this — go into my Google Calendar, create prospectuses and sales collateral for all 20 sales calls this week, pull all the data on them last year from Salesforce and HubSpot and Marketo, put them all apart, review them once, and then distribute them to the team — Gamma’s part of our team.” That’s not “AI-enhanced PowerPoint creation.” That’s replacing a marketing operations person entirely. “It’s not that far away,” Jason notes. “Not just make me PowerPoint. When Gamma is part of your marketing team rather than a marketing tool, there’s a lot of revenue expansion if they can pull it off.” Jason identifies the key shift happening right now: “The co-pilot was the 2024 story. It didn’t work. It was a ripoff. Spend $30 more a month on Office like no one wanted the ripoff. This year OpenAI and Claude finally actually got good. That’s why Lovable, Replit, Gamma exploded. Next year is AI is part of your team.” 2024: Co-pilots (didn’t work) Tools that made you more efficient but required constant human oversight and direction. 2025: Agents that work (breakthrough year) Applications where AI finally got good enough to deliver real value autonomously. 2026: AI team members (what’s coming) AI that’s sufficiently autonomous to be actual members of your team, not just tools your team uses. That transition from tool to team member is where the revenue explosion happens. Because when AI is a team member, companies will pay team-member prices ($50K-$150K+ per year), not tool prices ($10-$100 per month). If you’re building a company to replace human headcount: Jason’s right that most companies avoid saying this explicitly, but the economics are undeniable: “If you are not removing humans from the equation, you are going to be heavily discounted.” The market is dividing into: You have to choose which game you’re playing. And if you choose Path 2, you need to actually deliver on human replacement, not just talk about it. “You have a third option,” Jason concedes. “Use AI to massively displace an incumbent and steal all the revenue. In fact, that’s the history of B2B software mostly.” This is the path that sounds most familiar to traditional B2B investors. It’s what Salesforce did to Siebel. What HubSpot did to Marketo (before Marketo became HubSpot). What Slack did to email for internal communication. But Jason is deeply skeptical this path works well in the AI era: “I just don’t know how many of our public leaders are in a place to steal their own revenue.” In the traditional SaaS era, you had ~3 years before incumbents would really compete: “You’d be like, well, Salesforce or HubSpot, whoever, it’ll take them like a year and a half to decide if it’s worth cloning. Then they’ll launch something and it’ll be okay because they have smart engineers, but it won’t actually do anything. The first six months it’ll be so feature poor. Then after two years they’ll decide, should I put 100 people on this?” That timeline has collapsed from 3 years to 30 days. Jason shares a brutal example: “I can think of one investment I’ve made that has had five clones in the first 30 days, including one from a cloud leader.” The AI-enabled cloning speed changes everything. Canva is now “borderline competitive” with Gamma — and Canva wasn’t even a competitor when Gamma’s CEO was on the show just months earlier. Jason’s skepticism crystallizes around the most obvious displacement opportunity: CRM. “There’s like 400 AI CRM startups out there all saying they’re going to eat HubSpot’s and Salesforce’s lunch. That’s not exciting to me as an investment. That’s much less exciting than truly replacing 90% of your GTM team.” Why isn’t this exciting? Jason isn’t saying Path 3 is impossible. He’s saying it’s the hardest path and requires specific conditions: You need at least 3 of these 4: The Duolingo discussion illuminates why incumbent displacement is so hard for public companies. Duolingo displaced Berlitz and traditional language schools. Hooray. But now what? Jason: “Where are you going to disrupt humans? This is your job. You already disrupted those humans. Unfortunately, they’re gone. Where’s the next level of human disruption?” Rory sees the opportunity: “The next generation of companies that are going to be teaching a foreign language will be LLM-based. We’ve seen companies doing more professional, more interactive teaching using LLMs. There’s a whole ton to be done in terms of one-on-one instruction.” But here’s the problem: Duolingo can’t easily displace itself. They have a business model built around light learning at consumer prices ($10-20/month). The AI opportunity is intensive learning at tutoring prices ($50-200/month). That requires cannibalizing their existing revenue model. This is why Path 3 is especially hard for incumbents. They’re not in a position to displace themselves. Which creates the opening for startups, but also means you’re starting from zero on distribution against companies with millions of users. Jason’s answer: Only if you can’t play Path 1 or Path 2. “We can fund those deals as investors, but I think the first two categories are much easier — attached to the compute or replace humans — rather than just steal.” The math is simple: All three can work. But Path 3 requires the most capital, the longest timeline, and has the highest failure rate. Jason drops a truth bomb midway through the discussion: “We’re in the Captain Obvious era of investing. You either got something or you ain’t getting funded anyway.” What does this mean for these three paths? If you’re on Path 1 (compute-attached): Your growth should be automatic. If the hyperscalers are deploying 3x more compute and your revenue isn’t growing 2-3x, something is broken. This should be the most “Captain Obvious” path of all. If you’re on Path 2 (replacing humans): Your customers should be measurably reducing headcount or headcount growth. If they’re not, you’re not actually replacing humans — you’re just a productivity tool. If you’re on Path 3 (displacing incumbents): You should be winning deals against the incumbent consistently, not just in small accounts. If you’re only winning when there’s no incumbent, you’re not displacing anyone. The test is simple: Is your success obvious? Or are you explaining why your metrics are actually good despite not looking impressive? Throughout the discussion, the panel keeps coming back to what doesn’t work: using AI to make your existing product better. Jason is blunt: “Using AI to make your product better? That’s table stakes now, not a competitive advantage.” This is the Duolingo problem. They’re using AI to improve their language learning. Great. Every single competitor can do that too. There’s no moat in “we use AI to make our product better.” Rory agrees: “Every single portfolio company at scale should be using AI by this point to make your product better. This is not 2023. You don’t get any kudos for sprinkling AI dust on your product.” In 2023: Adding AI features was novel and impressive. Companies could raise on “we’re adding AI to X.” In 2025: Adding AI features is expected. It’s like saying “we have a mobile app” in 2023. Cool, so does everyone else. The market has moved from “are you using AI?” to “how are you using AI to capture revenue in one of the three ways that actually work?” Let’s be explicit about what isn’t one of the three paths: Not Path 1: “We sell to AI companies” Unless you’re infrastructure they can’t build AI without, this is just selling to hot companies. When the AI boom ends or slows, your growth ends. Not Path 2: “We make teams more efficient with AI” Unless headcount actually goes down or dramatically slows its growth, you’re not replacing humans. You’re selling productivity software. That’s fine, but it’s not Path 2. Not Path 3: “We’re better than the incumbent because we have AI” Unless you’re 10x better and winning head-to-head deals consistently, you’re not displacing anyone. You’re just another alternative. Harry shares a data point that shows how much the market has shifted: A classic enterprise SaaS company grew from $400K to $3M ARR (10x growth). Five years ago, this would have generated five term sheets from top firms. Today: 120 meetings, one term sheet at 12x revenue. Why? Because it’s not playing any of the three games. It’s not compute-attached. It’s not replacing humans. And it’s not dramatically displacing an incumbent with AI. It’s just a good SaaS company growing well. That’s not good enough anymore. Jason: “It’s the most binary fundraising environment in our lifetimes. You’re either Captain Obvious getting funded, or you’re not seeing it anywhere.” If you’re building a company or investing in one, here’s how to think about which path to pursue: Best for: Infrastructure engineers who understand ML workflows, companies with existing relationships in cloud/DevOps Best for: Founders who have done the job they’re replacing, deep understanding of workflow completion, strong AI/agent expertise Best for: Domain experts in industries with weak incumbents, founders with deep incumbent knowledge, situations with massive technological discontinuity If you can do Path 1, do Path 1. It’s the easiest and most capital-efficient. If you can’t do Path 1, do Path 2. The market for replacing humans is massive and underpenetrated. Only do Path 3 if you can’t do the first two or if you have specific advantages (domain expertise, weak incumbent, vertical specialization) that make it compelling. Jason’s final point ties it all together: “If you’re in software today and this isn’t the most exciting time of your lifetime, you’re doing it wrong. This is the first time software has gotten better since the three of us met.” But that excitement only matters if you’re playing one of the three games that actually capture revenue: Everything else — all the “AI-enhanced” products, all the “using AI to be better” positioning, all the sprinkling of AI dust on existing products — that’s not going to generate venture-scale returns. The market is telling us this clearly. DataDog up 23%. Duolingo down 25%. Same week. Both “using AI.” One playing a winning game, one not. Choose your path wisely. Because in 2025/2026, there are only three that actually work. Founder SaaStr Email Address Company Job Title Email Address Get from $0 to $100 Million in ARRwith less stress and more success.

NEXT | How to win the World Championship Hearthstone Tavern Brawl Cruising through old World of Warcraft content is something that I’ve loved doing for many years for the transmog, pets, and mounts, and now we can add Player Housing decor to the list of things you can pick up in legacy dungeons and raids. While there’s a surprisingly short list of adornments from the first eleven chapters of our journeys across Azeroth that are known to drop from bosses so far, it’s a safe bet that more will be added in the coming months and years. These decor items are guaranteed drops, so no tedious grinding is necessary for your first copy. Dungeons will have their last boss drop the decor item, but any boss from a raid could drop a furnishing. If you’re looking for multiple copies of any of these items, it’s a simple as running the instance again for a second or third (or 20th) copy of the item. Here is the list of decor I have on my launch day wish list. Valdrakken Hanging Lamp — After a quick run through the Ruby Life Pools, you’ll be able to hang an indoor-only glass sphere of enchanted fire from your rafters. The long rope gives this versatility, but the five colored gems really set it apart from the multitude of other lighting options. Magistrix’s Garden Fountain — Just a few bosses into The Nighthold is where you’ll encounter Spellblade Aluriel, who will now drop a stylish stone water feature each time you defeat her. You can place a large one front-and-center in your yard, but I’m excited to see what creative hijinks the community gets up to by taking advantage of this item’s ability to also be placed inside. Eye of Acherus — If you’re planning on using your home as a base for raising an army of undead and training them in the ways of the Death Knight, you’ll want one of these smoking blue orbs with its stylish skull-and-chain holder from the Pit of Saron. It’s a must-have for rooms with an Icecrown theme or as a Hallow’s End yard decoration. Tome of Pandaren Wisdom — I have already seen some amazing player-built features such as gaming tables and cozy reading nooks. This book bound in wood and red yarn found in the Temple of the Jade Serpent should give a little flair to any personal library or nightstand, and can even be placed outside for a bit of light Lorewalking in the shade. Gnomish Tesla Tower — Clearing Operation: Mechagon on any difficulty will net you this amazing electrical contraption that could be perfect for an interior workshop space or atop the pinnacle of your house as a lightning rod or weather station. This is an absolute necessity for any Gnome-themed area on your property. Crucible Votive — Here’s something perfect for setting just the right mood in your drawing room. If you’ll be running a murder mystery party, crafting an enormous pipe organ, or simply looking to furnish your dedicated brooding space, this rack of 46 candles drops from the Restless Cabal in the Crucible of Storms. Tidesage’s Fireplace — While you’re vanquishing the tentacled horrors of Stormsong Valley, you can pop over to the Shrine of the Storm and pick up this stunning full-wall masterpiece. Don’t even think about putting the finishing touches on any nautical-themed sitting parlor without this enormous green cephalopod adorning your mantle. Horde Warlord’s Throne — We’ll wrap up with a trio of Horde-themed decor for anyone looking to put an extra zug zug into their floorplan. You’ll have to get all the way through Siege of Orgrimmar to earn Garrosh Hellscream’s personal seat, but it will certainly be worth the effort to use it as a centerpiece in your great hall or to lord over your weekly lawn darts tournament. Orgrimmar Sconce — Skulloc in the Iron Docks is the source for this wall-mounted horn that holds up a flaming spiked cage on a thick metal chain. Lining a hallway or dining room with these is sure to get your name on the shortlist to be the next Chief Interior Decorator of the Horde Forces. Horde Battle Emblem — Here’s the perfect item to mount above your horned Warlord Throne. Clearing Upper Blackrock Spire will reward you with this axe/shield combo that can also be placed outside to the annoyance of your Alliance-biased HOA. Blizzard Watch is a safe space for all readers.

Title: Why Real-World Utility, Not Meme Coin Mania, Will Drive Crypto’s Next Wave

For years, crypto has resembled a casino, with flashy trends, wild price spikes and meme coins stealing the spotlight. But beneath the noise, something very different is taking shape in the middle of this so-called bear market. The next major leap in digital assets is unlikely to be fueled by the latest meme coin or a fleeting trading frenzy. Instead, it will be powered by real-world applications and the development of durable, institutional-grade infrastructure. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. As the industry evolves, a substantial shift in investment and engineering resources is underway. The focus is moving away from speculative”casino” behavior and toward more functional, enduring applications: everyday global payments, banking services built on stablecoins and the seamless integration of tokenization into traditional financial systems. This transition will mark the true maturation of the parallel financial system. A recent TRM Labs adoption report revealed that India, the United States, Pakistan, the Philippines and Brazil are now leading global digital asset usage. South Asia is also the fastest-growing crypto market in 2025. The next significant advancement in digital assets probably won’t be driven by a new meme coin or a temporary surge in trading activity. Crucially, the research shows that stablecoins accounted for approximately 30 percent of all on-chain activity, with total transaction volume rising above $4 trillion between January and July 2025, marking an 83 percent year-over-year increase. That isn’t the profile of a market anticipating the next viral trend. It’s the profile of a parallel payments and settlement layer taking shape. The last big boom was fueled by meme coins and quick-hit trading crazes. That era brought millions of newcomers into crypto, but it also cemented the perception of the industry as a digital gambling hall. Today’s landscape looks markedly different. Significant liquidity is now flowing through crypto spot ETFs. Stablecoin activity is at an all-time high. Tokenization markets are expanding. Serious capital is staying in the system, not just passing through for a quick bet. At the same time, hype-driven projects with no real utility beyond speculation are being flushed out. What’s emerging instead is infrastructure and applications designed for populations regularly excluded from traditional banking systems. One of the strongest indicators of this adoption-driven future lies in the emergence of a new class of financial institutions. For over a decade, neobanks were heralded as the future of finance, despite most remaining deeply tied to legacy rails, from know-your-customer (KYC) procedures and custody models to payment networks and physical card issuance. They did little for the 1.4 billion people who remain unbanked, and they still left users exposed to arbitrary account freezes and the same opaque systems that defined traditional banking. A new category, known as decentralized on-chain baking platforms, or deobanks, is taking the opposite approach. Instead of layering a sleek interface over incumbents, these platforms are building upward from blockchain infrastructure itself. Here, self-custodial accounts are connected through smart contracts, giving users real control over their assets, unlike the temporary permissions granted on a centralized bank ledger. These accounts also operate on stablecoin-native infrastructure, enabling cross-border transfers to settle in minutes and eliminating SWIFT fees and correspondent banking delays. Moreover, loyalty and governance are directly linked to network participation, rather than being obscured by unclear “points” programs. Critics point to new risks from key management challenges to smart contract exploits to uneven regulatory oversight. And while those concerns are valid, they also overlook that these systems offer meaningful benefits to millions who lack reliable access to savings, credit or affordable international payments. And this is where stablecoins change the story. This new infrastructure is paving the way for mainstream crypto adoption, where digital assets are used for everyday payments, not just speculative bets. As noted, stablecoin use has shot up considerably, with TRM Labs reporting that they now account for nearly one-third of all on-chain activity. Meanwhile, the regulatory landscape around them is shifting in ways that legitimize these assets. The U.S. recently enacted its first comprehensive legislation for fiat-backed tokens known as the GENIUS Act. The E.U.’s MiCA regulations are now in effect, and Hong Kong, along with other major financial hubs, has introduced dedicated frameworks for these assets. These developments are now making it possible for banks, payment processors and fintech companies to integrate with crypto infrastructure without the regulatory paralysis of prior years. They are also reshaping real-world incentives, making remittances from workers in the Gulf, Europe or North America to relatives in South Asia, Africa and Latin America, not only cheaper, but almost instant. With trillions of dollars flowing through stablecoins each year—and clear legal recognition emerging in major markets—they are becoming far more than payment novelties. Given that 90 percent of them are pegged to the U.S. dollar, these assets are now functioning as an alternative settlement layer for the dollar itself. As money increasingly flows through this system, a tipping point will arrive: an infrastructure strong enough to shape the next chapter of global finance. It’s become very difficult to believe that the next bull run will still be driven by the old question: Which coin will be 100x? Instead, it is far more likely to be driven by the networks processing the next trillion dollars in real-world payments. And because crypto is shedding its identity as a discrete asset class and becoming part of the invisible infrastructure behind everyday payment transactions, that shift may arrive sooner than expected. Two trends are powering this transition: the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) and the emergence of decentralized banks. Today, roughly $35.6 billion in RWAs is tokenized, with market-maker Keyrock projecting the figure will reach $50 billion by the end of 2025. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has also outlined a plan to unlock up to $4 trillion in digital wallet-held assets around the world through the digitization of traditional financial products—a signal of how large this market may grow. Deobanks, meanwhile, bring stablecoin payments and self-custody to the mainstream while layering in credit, savings and rewards. They allow users to bypass legacy intermediaries and plug directly into blockchain settlement rails. In such an ecosystem, liquidity can no longer depend on speculative waves. It will come from continuous flows: remittances, payroll, supplier payments, trade finance and tokenized fixed-income products. At that point, market cycles will sit on top of a growing base of structural demand, not narrative-driven inflows. Ultimately, it is this structural foundation that will determine how far any future bull market can run. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Following the launch of Gemini 3 with advanced capabilities across video, reasoning, and coding, Google is now the talk of the town in the generative AI category. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently admitted that the Gemini team had done a great job with the launch. Even NVIDIA, which has also been flying high due to the high demand for chips to foster AI advances (unlocking $4 trillion in market capitalization), recently indicated that it is delighted by Google's success (via Tom's Hardware). But perhaps more interestingly, the chipmaker used the opportunity to toot its own horn: "Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry — it's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done. Nvidia offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs, which are designed for specific AI frameworks or functions." This news comes after reports claim that Meta is currently in discussions with Google to rent its Cloud Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) in 2026, and even potentially buy them in the subsequent year. Consequently, Alphabet (Google's parent company) and Meta's stock prices saw a significant increase. However, NVIDIA's stock price dropped by 3%. We’re delighted by Google’s success — they’ve made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google.NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it’s the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done.NVIDIA offers greater…November 25, 2025 Google's Cloud TPUs are quite different from NVIDIA's AI GPUs. For context, the former's offerings are designed to help with AI model training and inference, while the latter are designed for parallel processing, allowing them to handle billions of calculations simultaneously. While speaking to CNBC, a Google spokesman indicated: “We are experiencing accelerating demand for both our custom TPUs and Nvidia GPUs. We are committed to supporting both, as we have for years.” During NVIDIA's earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang addressed the rising TPU competition, indicating that Google is the company's customer for GPU chips and that Gemini can run on its technology.

OLED tech means these elite TVs offer incredible contrast and no light bleed. Here are our top picks When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The best OLED TVs on the market today deliver beautiful image quality thanks to the self-lighting pixels that define this technology. What these pixels deliver are stunningly deep black tones and incredibly precise contrast between light and dark areas, in a way that LED or mini-LED TVs simply cannot match. Read our 'What is OLED?' guide for more on why this tech is such a big upgrade, and so sought-after. The best OLED TVs include a lot of models that rank among the best TVs overall, and come from the biggest TV brands, such as LG and Sony. Even Samsung – a TV company that had rejected OLED for years, has not only joined the party, but has topped our rankings here at times. Our picks of the best OLED TVs here aren't just ranked from the best-looking to the weakest, because that would put all the most expensive ones at the top. We've tried to be more discerning and helpful, choosing the best options for different price brackets and particular needs, hopefully making it easier to find the one that fits your need best. ⭣ Read more Why you can trust TechRadar's choices We've tested all the TVs here ourselves, and our TV review team is led by Al Griffin, an ISF-trained video calibrator with nearly three decades of AV journalism experience. He's trained our staff writers to balance objective testing of brightness and color accuracy (measured using high-end industry-standard equipment) with the more subjective elements of picture and sound quality – because you can't judge how an image looks to the eye based on scientific measurements alone. We're judging these TVs based not just on picture quality, but also the features they offer, and how that balances with the price. We provide ratings for each TV in the different sections we judge, as well as providing our measurements, so you can follow our decision making, and decide if your own priorities are slightly different. Each TV is vouched for by a member of the team, who's written up why they recommended it, as well as going in-depth on what we thought based on our review.

Our expert review: 1-minute summary: The LG C5 OLED TV continues the tradition of affordable, mid-range greatness exemplified by its C4 predecessor, now taking its place as our best OLED TV for most people. While picture quality between the two is largely similar, a new Alpha 9 Gen 8 AI Processor here delivers a modest brightness boost, along with AI-driven picture and sound enhancements. Available in a wide range of sizes from 42 to 83 inches, the C5 suits everything from desktop gaming to your home theater. It’s a fantastic choice for gamers with a full suite of essential features, including 4K 144Hz, VRR, FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync, ALLM and Dolby Vision gaming, all across four HDMI ports. The updated webOS smart TV platform uses AI to enhance search and both picture and sound customization, and it can be personalized for multiple users in the same household, using voice recognition to switch between them. Whether it’s for gaming, movies, or everyday viewing, the LG C5 is a superb all-purpose TV that offers excellent performance and value. Read our full LG C5 review ✅ You value versatility in an OLED TV: With picture quality that looks more premium than its price, excellent gaming features and a wide range of sizes, the C5 ticks all the boxes. ✅ You want an intuitive smart TV platform: webOS 25 is clean, responsive and easy to navigate with new AI tools that make setup, search and customization smarter than ever. ✅ You want a great gaming TV: With a full suite of gaming features, impressive performance and stunning visuals, the C5 is a perfect TV for gaming. ❌ You already own the LG C4: The LG C5 is excellent, but its upgrades are modest. Or at least not enough to justify replacing last year’s model if that’s what you have. ❌ You want the best built-in sound: Audio performance is decent, but it doesn’t match the C5’s stellar picture quality, and some rivals do sound better straight out of the box. ❌ You need HDR10+ support: The C5 supports Dolby Vision but skips HDR10+, which is becoming a more widely used HDR format on major streaming platforms. We measured the LG C5’s peak HDR brightness at 1,180 nits in Filmmaker Mode, which is a solid step up from the C4’s 1,065 nits. That extra brightness brings more punch to HDR highlights and adds realism to colors, which look rich and dynamic across Dolby Vision content. Shadow detail and contrast remain superb, with deep blacks and refined mid-tones in darker scenes. Upscaling is also impressive, giving HD and even standard definition sources a sharper, cleaner look. The only thing the C5 struggled a little with was screen reflections, especially when you’re watching in brighter rooms. The LG C5 uses a 2.2-channel, 40W Dolby Atmos speaker system with no DTS support. Its updated AI Sound Pro mode can upmix audio to a virtual 11.1.2 setup, creating a wider and more immersive soundstage than the C4. During testing, we particularly enjoyed using the TV’s AI Sound Pro mode, which enhanced every aspect of the audio, producing a brighter overall sound that may not suit everyone but we found it more engaging and immersive. The new AI Sound Wizard allows for personalized audio profiles, offering welcome customization even if some of the profiles didn’t quite hit the mark. Overall, sound quality is good, but pairing the C5 with one of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars is the ideal way to match its excellent picture performance. The LG C5 runs on webOS 25, which builds on its predecessor with a host of new AI tools, including AI Search, AI Concierge and AI Art. The upgraded Chatbot can now offer quick advice on picture or sound settings, though it struggles with more complex questions. Voice ID is a standout new addition, automatically recognizing who’s speaking and then switching to their personalized profile and recommendations. Quick Cards remain a handy way to organize apps by category, while the layout of webOS 25 is clean and easy to navigate. The Quick Menu is still a strong feature, letting you tweak settings on the fly without interrupting what you’re watching. The LG C5 is a great choice if you want a gaming TV with full support for 4K 144Hz, VRR (AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync), HGiG, Dolby Vision gaming and ALLM across its four HDMI 2.1 ports. Its Game Optimizer mode lets you fine-tune settings, while the Game Quick Card provides access to cloud gaming services, like Amazon Luna and Nvidia GeForce Now. Input lag measures an impressively low 9.2ms, and gameplay feels smooth and responsive with no tearing and blurring. Combined with the C5’s vibrant picture quality and deep contrast, it’s one of the best OLED TVs you can buy for gaming. The LG C5 is a feature-packed OLED TV that offers premium performance at a mid-range price, making it one of the best all-round options for most people for movies and gaming. However, at launch, the 65-inch model costs $2,699.99 / £2,699.99. While the C4, which is still available, can now be found for $1,499.99 / £1,499.99, which is a big difference given how similar the two sets are. Yes, the C5 adds the brightness boost and new AI features, but it isn’t a major leap forward. Having said that, prices are likely to fall, and once the C4 disappears, the C5 will become even more of a clear go-to OLED. Our expert review: 1 minute summary: If you're looking for a cheaper way to get a 2024 OLED TV, then the LG B4 is for you. Although it's price isn't much less than the step-up LG C4, it's still cheaper, with further discounts likely to come. The B4 may be the entry-level OLED in LG's 2024 lineup, but I feel it outperforms its price, delivering a rich, colorful, accurate picture with plenty of detail. When I tested the B4, it proved to be a fantastic performer for movies, but also an accomplished gaming TV, with its four HDMI 2.1 ports supporting many features found in the best gaming TVs such as 4K, 144Hz, Dolby Vision gaming, VRR and more. I found its during testing that its sound isn't the strongest, with limited bass and average virtual surround reproduction, and its picture brightness pales compared to more premium OLED TVs, but the B4 is still an excellent entry-level set. ✅ You want an OLED on a budget: The B4 is cheaper than any other 2024 OLED TV on the market and mostly covers all the bases. ✅ You want a cheaper OLED for gaming: The B4 is an excellent gaming TV, with four HMDI 2.1 ports supporting 4K, 144Hz, VRR and more. ✅ You want a detailed picture: The LG B4's crisp detail, rich contrast and bold colors suggest a more premium OLED. ❌ You want great sound: The B4's built-in sound doesn't match the quality of its picture, with limited bass and Dolby Atmos effects. ❌ You want the brightest OLED: Compared with step-up OLED models, the B4's brightness is average, peaking at 656 nits. ❌ You need full HDR support: The B4 supports Dolby Vision HDR, but not HDR10+. The B4's picture impressed during our testing, with its deep black levels, strong contrast and vibrant colors in particular standing out. In our review, we praised the B4's "exceptional shadow detail" and its Dolby Vision Filmmaker Mode, which provided an accurate picture with ease. We did find that its lower brightness made its picture less dynamic than what you'll find in step-up OLEDs such as the LG C4, but the B4's picture is still very good, especially for an OLED at this price. The B4's sound is average and while it does the job, it won't beat TVs like the Sony Bravia 8 anytime soon. While it delivers clear dialogue and has a good balance, its bass is limited and virtual surround sound effects lack impact. At higher volumes, it can even sound "thin and edgy" as we said in our review. For casual viewing, the B4's sound will most likely be fine, but if you're looking for a more cinematic experience, you'll want to add a soundbar. The B4 uses LG's own smart TV platform, webOS, and it's easily one of the best smart interfaces on the market. Quick Cards organize apps into easy to navigate categories and a Quick Menu, which we praised in our review, means useful settings can be adjusted easily without moving away from what's on screen. There is a large banner ad at the top of the home page, but this is becoming commonplace on smart TV platforms and is really the only criticism we have of the user-friendly webOS. With four HDMI 2.1 ports supporting 4K 144Hz, Dolby Vision gaming, VRR (including AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia GSync), HGiG, ALLM and Dolby Vision gaming, the B4 has things more than covered when it comes to gaming. Its Game Optimizer is a useful feature that allows for easy adjustments to gaming settings and there's also cloud gaming app support. A 9.1ms input lag time (with Boost Mode activated) means the B4 delivers exceptional gaming performance and combined with the features listed above, the B4 comes out as a superb gaming OLED with a cheaper price tag. The 65-inch B4 costs roughly $1,499 / £1,699 / AU$2,795. When compared to the $1,599/ £1,899 / AU$3,495 you'll pay for the LG C4, which provides higher brightness and a performance boost thanks to a faster processor, the B4 doesn't offer the greatest value overall. Still, it is a well-featured and high quality OLED TV that more than justifies its price. Our expert review: 1-minute summary: The LG G5 is the company's flagship OLED for 2025, and when I tested it, with its next-gen OLED panel, I could barely have been more impressed. Not only does this new panel bring spectacular color and contrast, but high brightness levels I didn't though would be possible on OLED a few years ago. Not only does it bring incredible picture quality, but it also comes loaded with the full suite of features I've come to expect from LG's OLEDs in both gaming and smart-based applications. I also found that the new AI-based tools in LG's latest smart TV platform, webOS 25, should give some users real help when navigating their new OLED TV. While it may be a pricier option than its step-down counterpart, the LG C5, I said in my review it still serves as "a best-in-class OLED TV option for 2025". It's easily the premium OLED to beat this year. Read our full LG G5 review ✅ You want an OLED fit for all rooms: With higher fullscreen brightness levels and a new Filmmaker Ambient Light Mode, the G5 is ideal for all viewing situations. ✅ You want a TV for wall-mounting: With a slim-fit, wall-hugging design, the G5 will look perfect on your wall. ✅ You want a premium OLED for gaming: 4K, 165Hz, AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync and a low 9.1ms input lag make the G5 one of the best gaming TVs around. ❌ You want HDR10+ support: While it supports Dolby Vision, the G5 does not support HDR10+, which is used on some 4K Blu-rays and streaming services. ❌ You don't want to use a soundbar: The G5's built-in speakers are more than adequate, but don't match the level of its picture quality. It deserves a soundbar or speaker system. ❌ You want to save money: The step-down LG C5 doesn't deliver the same brightness or color depth, but it's significantly cheaper while delivering basically the same features. The LG G5 introduces a new OLED panel called Primary Tandem RGB or 'four-stack', that delivers incredible brightness and amazing color and contrast. Now holding the distinction of the brightest OLED we've tested so far (it hit 2,268 nits in Filmmaker Mode), the G5 is superb in all viewing conditions with no need to adjust lighting. As we pointed out in our review "contrast, color saturation, and shadow detail all held up nicely even with my room’s overhead lighting on". A new Filmmaker Ambient Light Mode also effectively adjust gamma to suit your room's lighting conditions, meaning you never need to alter your settings. It also delivers fantastic motion for both sports and movies. The G5's built-in 4.2 channel speaker system delivers clear speech and effective positioning of spatial sound effects, especially when using the AI Sound Pro mode. A new Sound wizard also allows you to create your own sound profile (in a similar vein to the TV's picture Wizard) which could be useful for some users. While the G5's sound is perfectly good, it deserves a robust Dolby Atmos soundbar to match its picture prowess. Already one of the best smart TV platforms on offer, webOS 25 introduces new AI-based tools such as AI Search and AI Concierge that make browsing for and finding recommended movies and TV shows a breeze. Its Quick Card and Quick Menu remain useful staples of the webOS interface that make navigation user-friendly and easy. Plus, it runs smoothly with fast, lag-free performance. As we said in our review "LG TVs have fantastic gaming credentials" and the G5 is no different. Four HDMI 2.1 ports all support 4K, 165Hz, VRR (AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync), HGiG and Dolby Vision gaming, plus it boasts an ultra-low 9.1 ms input lag time when Boost mode in the Game Optimizer menu is activated. Its Game Quick Card also has access to a wealth of cloud based gaming portals such as Luna and Nvidia GeForce Now. When it comes to gaming TVs, it doesn't get better than the G5. The G5 is a premium priced TV, but it delivers premium features and performance. That being said, the step-down LG C5 delivers a lot similar features and excellent performance for a lower cost and the G5 is priced higher than some of its rivals, including the Samsung S95F at launch. Still, given what the G5 does deliver, its pricing isn't surprising or unfair. Our expert review: 1-minute summary: Panasonic’s new flagship OLED, the Z95B, is a worthy successor to last year’s Z95A. It introduces a new Primary RGB Tandem panel that pushes brightness while delivering richer, more natural color detail. In our testing, it hit an impressive 2,107 nits. But Panasonic has made a commitment to accuracy over brightness. The result is that movies look refined, subtle and true-to-life, rather than simply boosted. But the real story here is sound. The Z95B takes a big step forward with audio. Its 360 Soundscape Pro system, tuned by Technics, has been upgraded with new drivers and a refined speaker layout. The result is one of the best built-in sound systems you’ll find on any TV. It’s powerful, immersive and clear enough that you can even comfortably skip buying a soundbar. That alone gives the Z95B excellent value compared to its OLED rivals. Read our full Panasonic Z95B review ✅ You want the ultimate movie night TV: The Z95B’s sharp, colorful and accurate picture makes Blu-rays and streaming films look incredible. ✅ You don’t want to clutter your living room with a soundbar: Its built-in 5.1.2-channel speaker system delivers big, immersive sound that’s good enough to stand on its own. ❌ You prefer watching with the lights on: The picture is good in all scenarios, but it's at its best in dim rooms, and the anti-glare screen isn’t the strongest for bright, sunlit spaces. ❌ You dislike fiddling with settings: This TV has a long list of advanced picture and sound options, and while you can ignore them, some fine-tuning helps unlock its best performance. Panasonic has introduced a new 'four-stack' OLED panel design in the Z95B, with separate red and green layers sandwiched between dual blue layers. This allows for a much brighter image than past models while keeping color richness intact. Our tests measured peak HDR brightness at 2,107 nits – impressive by OLED standards. But unlike rivals chasing sheer brightness, Panasonic’s focus here is accuracy. The Z95B delivers a natural, finely balanced image with subtle gradations and detail. Skin tones and textures look especially lifelike. There’s also an advanced cooling system to help the panel maintain peak brightness during demanding HDR scenes. In its most accurate presets (Filmmaker Mode, True Cinema, Cinema), it doesn’t reach the same dazzling brightness as some competitors. But what you gain is a consistent, refined picture. The Z95B retains the 5.1.2-channel 360 Soundscape Pro speaker system from the Z95A, but Panasonic has improved the driver quality and tweaked the layout too. The result is even better, spacious, powerful and immersive sound. In fact, we’d call this one of the best built-in TV sound systems available today. Dialogue is clear, effects have impact and there’s enough scale to rival mid-range soundbars. A handy “Sound Focus” feature ensures dialogue stays sharp even when you’re sitting off to the side. We rarely say this, but the Z95B is strong enough sonically that you could skip an external soundbar and still feel very satisfied. That makes it exceptional value in the premium TV market. The Z95B runs Amazon’s Fire TV platform. While it isn’t the slickest or most elegant interface in our opinion, it’s reliable, offers a wide spread of apps and integrates well with Alexa and Prime Video. Navigation is quick, and performance felt solid across apps and menus. It’s not our favorite smart platform compared to LG’s webOS or Samsung’s Tizen, but it covers the essentials well and many will appreciate its familiarity. Gamers also benefit from Fire TV’s support for cloud gaming apps. The Z95B is well-equipped for gaming. There’s support for 4K at 144Hz, Dolby Vision gaming, and VRR, including AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync. Input lag is low, and the picture retains the same accuracy advantages seen in movies. The main limitation is connectivity. With only two HDMI 2.1 ports, rather than the four found on some competitors, you’ll need to prioritize which devices get full-featured connections. But the Z95B’s strong built-in sound system reduces the need for a soundbar, making this compromise less restrictive than usual. Panasonic OLED TVs are usually priced higher than the competition, but the Z95B launched at the same level as key rivals. Add in the fact that discounts are already appearing and this flagship is looking like excellent value. Factor in the built-in 5.1.2-channel audio, which genuinely removes the need for a separate soundbar, and the Z95B stands out as one of the smartest buys in the premium OLED space right now. Our expert review: 1-minute summary: The Samsung S95F has the reflection-beating matte screen of its predecessor, the S95D, but improves on it by maintaining more accurate black levels even in bright conditions. It also delivers spectacular colors and realistic textures. The S95F is a gamer's dream, with 4K 165Hz, VRR (AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync), ALLM and HDR10+ gaming support across four HDMI 2.1 ports and is a good-looking TV, with a razor-thin profile. While its sound could be better and there is still some black crush in darker scenes, the S95F is still undeniably one of 2025's best TVs. Read our full Samsung S95F review ✅ You want an OLED fit for all rooms: With OLED Glare Free anti-reflection tech, the S95F's impeccable picture can be viewed in the brightest of rooms. ✅ You want the QD-OLED experience: Contrast, brightness and color are all fantastic on the S95F, proving the advantages of its QD-OLED display panel. ✅ You want an OLED that looks premium: A trim profile, razor-thin depth, and an external connections box to keep things neat make the S95F one of the best-looking TVs around. ❌ You want full HDR support: Despite covering nearly all the bases, the S95D does not support Dolby Vision HDR. ❌ You want the absolute best black levels: The S95F's anti-reflection screen is useful, but it does compromise on black levels, which look raised compared to the competition. ❌ You're on a budget: Elite performance does come with an elite price tag, and the S95F sits near the top end of the OLED market. I described the S95F as " a sight to behold even compared to the best OLED TVS" in my review, thanks to its stunning brightness levels, gorgeous, vibrant colors and solid contrast. The real star of the show is its OLED Glare Free 2.0 screen, which eliminates pesky mirror-like reflections even in the brightest of rooms. Its motion handling is also responsive with a bit of tweaking, making it great for viewing sports. While there are instances of black crush, the S95F's picture is staggeringly good and it's easily one of the best I've seen in 2025. Tizen has never been the best smart TV platform, but Tizen 9.0, the 2025 version, is the best one yet. With a useful quick menu, access to every major app and hubs for app organisation – Game, Home, Daily+ and Ambient – Tizen is now in a better place. Yes, some settings are still buried in deep menus and are a pain to access, but that is my only real gripe with this now-great smart TV system. The S95F's built-in sound delivers punchy bass, effective placement and tracking of sound thanks to Samsung's Object Tracking Sound+ feature, and speech is clear throughout. Where the S95F comes up short is in its narrow-feeling soundstage, which isn't as immersive as the sound on TVs from the likes of Sony and Panasonic. Some people will be pleased with the S95F's sound, but others may want a soundbar for a more cinematic experience. Gaming is another area where the S95F shines. It's packed with gaming features, including 4K 165Hz, VRR with AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync, ALLM and HDR10+ gaming, along with four HDMI 2.1 ports. It also delivers an ultra-low 9.5ms input lag time as well as Samsung's Gaming Hub with cloud gaming options for those without a console. Picture-wise, the S95F benefits any game played on it. The S95F is a phenomenal gaming TV that gamers will love. As always, judging a flagship OLED's value is tough. While the S95F more than delivers for the money with its features, picture quality and premium design, its price tag ($2,499 / £2,499 for the 55-inch model I tested) will outstretch most budgets. The S95F is an elite TV after all, so its hefty price tag is to be expected. • Most OLED TVs are premium: 4K, 120Hz, with four HDMI ports • Brightness varies greatly and some have more HDMI 2.1 ports for gaming • Samsung OLED TVs use HDR10+, most other OLED TVs have Dolby Vision OLED TVs tend to be premium TVs, which means you're getting a certain level of features in almost all of them – they're all 4K, they're mostly 120Hz for gaming, for example, and they tend to all have four HDMI ports, and premium smart TV software. But they're absolutely not all the same. Some are much brighter than others (around twice as bright, in some cases), some have more HDMI 2.1 ports for next-gen gaming, some have better sound systems, and they don't all come in the same size options. It's important to consider what size TV is best for you, and to do that you'll literally need to measure the space you have to work with. Remember a TV that fills every available scrap of space in your living room might sound like a great idea, but you'll need to consider viewing angles, screen brightness and whether you'll be able to sit a decent distance from the TV to fully appreciate it. The LG C4 has the widest range of sizes of any TV we feature, so if you need something smaller, that's a great place to start. When it comes to HDR support, we recommend mostly that people choose TVs with Dolby Vision, because it's the most commonly used advanced HDR format on the best streaming services. Samsung TVs only use HDR10+, which is similar technology, but not as well supported. It's not a dealbreaker that Samsung's TVs don't support Dolby Vision, but as you'll see in our list, we prefer sets that include it. At the start of the year, at the big CES 2025 technology show, we got our first look at the new OLED TVs coming during 2025. LG has released the LG G5, which has taken a top-level spot on this list as our choice for 'Best premium OLED.' We've also reviewed the mid-range LG C5 OLED, though the LG C4 remains our pick as the 'Best for most people' due to its ongoing availability and excellent value. The LG B5 budget TV should comes a little later, though this year the B5 is only coming in two sizes, sadly. The Samsung S95F and has since been added to this list as the best OLED for bright rooms . This TV also comes in an 83-inch model for the first time – though that size will use a new-gen W-OLED panel (the same as the LG G5) instead of the QD-OLED panel used for the 55-inch, 65-inch and 75-inch sizes. Samsung also announced the S90F mid-range OLED TV, in sizes from 42 inches to 83 inches. Finally Samsung will have a cheaper S85F OLED TV option, which is expected to be less bright. Sansui has announced that it will have a budget range of OLED TVs from 55 to 77 inches in the US, which we expect will start from about $800 based on last year's models – that's massively cheaper than the equivalent from LG. Panasonic announced that it will launch a new range of OLEDs, led by the flagship Panasonic Z95B, a model that has since been added to this list as the best for sound option Hisense will have some OLED TV options in some countries, but we're waiting on confirmation of what those TVs will be in terms of size and specs. Sony released the new Sony Bravia 8 II OLED, and Philips will likely announce new OLED TVs for the UK and Europe, also closer to spring. • Entry-level OLED TVs tend to cost from $1,000 / £900 / AU$1,500 • You'll pay twice as much for mid-tier OLED TVs and triple for high-end sets • Sales events like Black Friday and Prime Day are a great time to buy an OLED TV The cost of OLED TVs varies hugely depending on what technologies are thrown in with an OLED panel, such as the resolution, processor, build quality, built-in speakers, and more. But suffice to say that entry-level models sit around (or, more recently, just under) the $1,000 / £900 / AU$1,500 mark. More mid-tier OLEDs at larger sizes (65 inches and above) can double that figure, or triple it when you're looking at the cutting-edge high-end panels. You might also notice that you don't get that much of a lower price with the smaller 42-inch sizes of OLED TV – that's because making them so small relies on relatively new tech, so they're not quite such good value per inch. Sales periods such as Prime Day or Black Friday tend to include lots of discounts on OLED TV models, though – especially from LG and Samsung. • Samsung TVs often use its competing QLED tech rather than OLED • QLED generally has better brightness than OLED • Mini LED TVs have OLED-rivalling or beating contrast OLED isn't the only option for savvy TV buyers. Samsung's competing QLED televisions outperform for brightness, while the introduction of Mini LED backlights has only improved peak light output and overall contrast – the areas that OLED generally has the upper hand with, thanks to its per-pixel brightness control. It's a tighter race than ever, then, though it's worth assessing secondary characteristics for OLED and QLED screens. An OLED with a cheap processor may cause more artefacts and video noise, while a QLED with edge-lighting won't get the true benefit of its enhanced color and contrast. Format or feature support can be crucial if you're hooking up your TV to a PC, a games console, or a 4K Blu-ray player too. According to LG Display, the makers of the OLED panels that go into every OLED TV on the list - around 100,000 hours. For most folks that's about 10 years of TV watching and far exceeds the 40,000 to 60,000-hour lifespans of most LED-LCD TVs. That said, OLED TVs can experience something called burn-in when a static image is left on the screen for prolonged periods of time - so be sure to change the channel every few days. OLED is, for many, the premium TV tech of the moment. Though once weighed down by inaccessible price points, a flurry of cheaper mid-range OLEDs and smaller panel sizes has helped bring OLED closer to the mass market. Samsung and Sony's current TV lineups include QD-OLED hybrids (they combine OLED panels with quantum dot tech, utilising the self-emissive properties of the former and color enhancements of the latter) – we have a separate guide to whether you should buy a Samsung OLED TV, if you want to read more about them. For those with cash to splash, you'll be choosing between a high-end OLED TV and Micro LED – a self-emissive panel technology that Samsung has leant into in recent times, but which has proved difficult to offer either affordably or at mainstream sizing (88-inch is the smallest we've heard about so far, as of 2024). It's a more complicated picture than simply OLED, then, though for deep blacks and true-to-life color – at a size you can actually get into the average living room – OLED may still be the best choice. • Burn-in has traditionally been a problem on OLED TVs • Most OLED TVs now have ways to prevent burn-in, including Auto Brightness Limiting (ABL) • These days, burn-in is not a big problem or something to worry about Burn-in, also known as screen burn or permanent image retention, is a visual artefact that sometimes appears when a TV has shown the same thing in the same place for a long time. It definitely happens on some OLED TVs, but manufacturers have come up with lots of ways to minimise the likelihood of it happening to yours. There are three main ways in which OLED TVs can minimise the likelihood of burn-in. They can use image analysis to identify static images – TV channel logos, for example – and subtly dim them. They can gently shift the image around by a few pixels, something that your OLED probably does already without you noticing it. And there's a more brute-force approach, where the TV automatically dulls the brightness of the whole display when it detects a bright and potentially burn-in item. That latter one is the least popular because if it isn't implemented well it can be quite dramatic and quite annoying. More modern TVs with this tech, known as ABL (Auto Brightness Limiting) are much more subtle about it than older ones. Last but not least, you can take the DIY route. The default modes such as Vivid Mode on some TVs can be ridiculously bright, so changing them or using less blazing settings will make your eyes happy and reduce the risk of burn-in even further. Ultimately burn-in is all about heat, hence the name. And the best way to reduce the risk of it and perhaps eliminate it altogether is to manage heat better in OLED TVs. And manufactures are doing just that. You'll find clever heatsink technology and heat dissipation design in OLEDs from Panasonic, LG, Sony and more. We're not saying burn-in doesn't exist. It does. But the advances in OLED TV tech in recent years means it's much less of an issue than it was in early OLEDs, and for most of us it's something we don't really need to worry about too much. • OLED TVs usually have a fast 120Hz or 144Hz refresh rate, which is great for gaming • The Xbox Series X's Dolby Vision format won't work with Samsung TVs • Look for HDMI 2.1 ports – ideally four – for ultimate gaming performance Arguably, all OLED TVs are ideal for gaming as they typically have a fast, 120Hz or higher refresh rate and pixel-level brightness control that helps fast-motion images look solid. Even so, there are differences between the various OLED TVs in this guide that can make them better suited for different gaming scenarios. High dynamic range support varies among the different TV brands, and that can have an impact on gaming. Samsung TVs, for instance, support the HDR10+ format, but not Dolby Vision. So, if you’re using an Xbox Series X console, you won’t be able to take advantage of its Dolby Vision gaming capabilities when playing on a Samsung TV. LG TVs, in contrast, do have Dolby Vision HDR support, but not the competing HDR10+ format. That’s not as much as an issue for gaming, however, as the availability of games with HDR10+ is very limited compared to Dolby Vision. Panasonic TVs support both the Dolby Vision and HDR10+ formats. If you’re looking for a maximum 4K 144Hz refresh rate for PC gaming, you’ll find broad support for that feature among the TVs in this guide. In fact, the only TV that doesn’t offer 4K 144Hz support is the LG B4, which maxes out at 4K 120Hz. The Samsung and LG TVs in this guide each provide four HDMI 2.1 ports with 4K 120Hz pass-through. Having four HDMI ports on a TV used for gaming is important because it allows you to connect both PS5 and Xbox One X gaming consoles and take advantage of their high refresh rate capability while also connecting a soundbar to the TV. Like many other TVs, the Panasonic TV in our guide maxes out at two HDMI 2.1 ports. That’s not so much of an issue in this case, however, since the Panasonic’s excellent built-in speaker system is powerful enough that you don’t necessarily need a soundbar. • Brightness used to be a problem for OLED TVs • New tech such as QD-OLED and Micro Lens Array has vastly improved brightness • Some of the latest sets also have anti-glare screen coatings OLED TVs in the past lagged behind QLED TVs with regular LED and mini-LED backlights when it came to brightness. The most recent crop of high-end OLED TVs has changed the game, however, by using new technologies such as QD-OLED (a Samsung-developed tech that combines an OLED display panel with quantum dots which is used in specific Samsung and Sony OLED TVs) and Micro Lens Array (an LG-developed tech combining a layer of microscopic lens elements with an OLED panel that’s used on specific OLED TVs from LG and other brands, including Panasonic). LG has also introduced the Primary Tandem RGB (four-stack) panel to the mix, adding even more brightness and more accurate black levels and color to deliver brightness like we've never seen in an OLED before. These new technologies have now made OLED competitive on the brightness front, with new models such as the Samsung S95D, LG G5 and even the LG G4 delivering peak brightness levels that even exceed some mini-LED TVs, which are typically the brightness champs. The LG G5 and G4 and especially the Samsung S95D also use anti-glare screen coatings, which, combined with the TV’s high brightness levels, make them a reasonable option for viewing in well-lit living rooms. • We run a suite of subjective and objective tests when reviewing TVs • We use specialized equipment such as colorimeters and test pattern generators • We test gaming features, upscaling, viewing angles and use different AV sources When testing the best OLED TVs, we use the same criteria that we consider in all of our TV reviews, which focuses on picture quality, audio quality, smart TV platform, design, gaming features and value for money. Our testing is not only made up of subjective opinions about each of criteria, but also on objective measurements taken using specialized equipment – you can read our full guide to how we test TVs at TechRadar, or read on for a summary. Using different AV sources, including broadcast, streaming and Blu-ray, we’ll run in every TV whilst cycling through its picture preset modes, such as Sport, Movie and Standard, to determine which settings are the most accurate for different types of media. We do this to determine what the best settings are for watching movies and TV shows or a sports match for example. Once we have established which picture modes are best suited for different types of content, we then analyze aspects of the display such as its colors, contrast, black levels and more using reference scenes we have specifically chosen to best evaluate these. When testing an OLED’s picture quality, we’re looking for deep black levels and contrast, which should be better than many other TVs on the market thanks to the screen’s ability to dim individual pixels over local dimming found in LCD TVs – often this is determined by zones and the backlight’s ability. We’ll also look at the color’s vibrancy and punchiness compared to textures and details, particularly sharpness and true-to-life accuracy. Using lower-resolution sources such as broadcast and DVD, we’ll also test a TV’s upscaling, looking to see how effectively that TV’s processing can enhance lower-res images to be displayed on a larger, 4K screen. During these tests, we also consider the viewing angle from off-center seats, which – again with the OLED panel’s ability to self-dim – should maintain strong contrast levels and picture quality even from the most awkward of viewing positions. After these subjective tests, we then take specialized equipment — a colorimeter, test pattern generator and Portrait Displays’ Calman calibration software – to perform objective tests and record the results, taking measurements of brightness, color and grayscale accuracy, gamut and more. The first test we usually do is of the TV’s brightness. Using different sized white window patterns, we measure the the TV’s peak brightness on windows including 10%, which will show the maximum brightness we can expect from the TV itself, and 100% to test full screen brightness, which will demonstrate how the TV can handle consistent levels of brightness across the whole screen (this is key when viewing sports). Full screen brightness also gives an idea of how well a TV will manage reflections. OLED TVs have often been known to offer lower levels of brightness when compared to QLED and mini-LED. But in recent years, the introduction of OLED EX panels and micro-lens-array (MLA) tech means we expect higher peak brightness levels, but still lower full screen brightness when compared to other LCD panels. We use light controlled environments when testing brightness to make sure any other light sources, environmental or otherwise, does not affect results. We also test color color reproduction in both SDR and HDR to compare its accuracy when displaying different source materials and the maximum color gamut it can show on screen. We do the same for grayscale as well, testing just how accurately a TV displays gray tones from black to white. With OLED TVs, we expect color accuracy to be among the best in the TV market, along with grayscale. Gaming is another important aspect of TVs nowadays, so we make sure to test a TV’s gaming performance by analyzing response time, graphics and latency — all of which are areas OLED TVs often excel at. We also look out for features such as a Game Mode (for adjusting a TV’s settings to the most optimum for gaming), 4K 120Hz, VRR and more. We measure response time by using a Leo Bodnar 4K HDMI input lag tester to see what latency is added by a TV’s processing. We always aim to keep our testing as consistent as possible, but it’s important to note that some of our writers’ setups and testing environments do vary. We do, however, make sure that all tests conducted use the same criteria between all of our writers, also making sure that the equipment is similar enough to achieve the same level of accuracy. The Samsung S90F series OLED TV received a five-star rating in our Samsung S90F review, but isn’t included in this guide. The main reason for this is that the 65-inch model Samsung sent us for review features a QD-OLED display panel, while other screen sizes in the S90F series are subject to a ‘panel lottery’ where either a QD-OLED or a regular W-OLED display panel may be used in the TV. This means that our Samsung S90F ratings apply to the 65-inch model and don’t necessarily extend to other screen sizes in the S90F series. Our review praised the S90F for its impressive brightness, richer color than its Samsung S90D predecessor, and its crisp 4K upscaling of HD sources. The only areas where we found its picture lacking were a tendency to crush shadow detail in some presets, and a slight gray cast to blacks when watched in rooms with bright ambient lighting – a limitation you won’t find on OLED TVs with higher peak light output, such as the LG G5 (included in this guide as 'The best premium OLED.' Otherwise, S90F series TVs are an excellent option for gaming, with 4K 144Hz support across all four HDMI 2.1 ports, AMD Freesync Premium Pro format and Nvidia G-Sync, Samsung’s Gaming Hub for cloud-based gaming, and an ultra-low 9.2ms measured input lag. The 65S90F model we tested is also a great value for a QD-OLED TV, coming in around £700 / $800 cheaper than the 65-inch version of Samsung’s S95F flagship OLED for 2025. LG G4: One of LG's flagship OLEDs for 2024, the LG G4 delivers superb picture quality and comes with all the features you'd need; both gaming and smart. It earned five out of five stars in our LG G4 review as it really is the complete package. It's not on our list as it's been replaced by its successor, the LG G5, which delivers everything the G4 does but with added brightness and even better picture quality. Don't get us wrong; the G4 is still a fantastic TV and if you can get a good deal on it, it's absolutely worth the investment! LG C5: The successor to the #1 TV in this guide, the LG C4, the LG C5 continues the LG C-series legacy of delivering arguably the best picture, features and performance for its competitive price in the mid-range OLED market. Earning five out of five stars in our LG C5 review, the only reason it's not on this list is because the C4 is still available for far lower prices. The C5 isn't enough of an upgrade to warrant knocking off the C4 yet, but once the C4 is no longer available, the C5 is likely to take its place. Sony Bravia 8: Sony's only 2024 OLED TV, the Bravia 8 impressed us during testing with its lifelike details and vivid colors, thanks to a brightness boost over its predecessor, the Sony A80L, that make HDR images pop. It's also a solid gaming TV with 'perfect for PS5' features and it has brilliant built-in sound. While it's a great TV, it doesn't hit the right price point like the LG C4, but if you want a more mid-range option with sound good enough to not need a soundbar, it's a very strong option, as our full Sony Bravia 8 review really digs into. Panasonic Z85A: A mid-range OLED TV, the Panasonic Z85A still showcases the superb picture quality we've come to know from Panasonic's OLEDs. Plus, it delivers a good array of gaming features and solid built-in sound. Unfortunately, it has to contend with a crowded mid-range OLED TV market that's dominated by the LG C4, which offers a lot of the same plus points of the Z85A at a much cheaper price, though otherwise our Panasonic Z85A review is pretty glowing. Philips OLED809: It's no secret that we here at TechRadar adore Philips' OLED TVs, mostly for their unique Ambilight feature; a series of lights around the frame of the TV that project bold colors around and onto the wall behind. The OLED809 delivers excellent picture quality for a mid-range OLED, but is slightly beaten on overall value by the LG C4 – it's also only available to our UK and European readers. Read our Philips OLED809 review if you like the idea of a TV that feels much bigger than it is, though. Philips OLED909: This is a high-end TV, using the same elite panel as the LG G4, delivering stunningly bright and HDR-rich picture, aided by the Ambilight feature. The built-in Bowers & Wilkins sound system is also a nice addition, adding real meat compared to other built-in TV speakers, and replacing the need for a smaller soundbar. We think the Samsung S95D is a little more versatile and better value for most people, but it's an excellent TV, no question, as our full Philips OLED909 review digs into. Philips OLED959: This is a truly elite TV, but puts itself in quite a niche bracket by coming in very specific sizing, and with a giant metal stand as part of the package. It's also pricier than the competition – and its 'upgraded' version of Philips' Ambilight tech was too busy for us, and doesn't actually feel like a higher-end version. Still, you get amazing image quality and top-tier built-in sound, so if you like the idea of a freestanding TV with awesome AV skills, it's well worth reading our Philips OLED959 review. October 24, 2025Replaced the LG C4 with the newer LG C5 as our 'best for most people' pick, based on our recent testing. August 27, 2025Replaced the Panasonic Z95A with the brand's latest flagship OLED TV, the Panasonic Z95B, as our 'Best for sound' pick.

Hey everyone, As I find the topic of Google TPUs extremely important, I am publishing a comprehensive deep dive, not just a technical overview, but also strategic and financial coverage of the Google TPU. Topics covered: The history of the TPU and why it all even started? The difference between a TPU and a GPU? Performance numbers TPU vs GPU? Where are the problems for the wider adoption of TPUs Google’s TPU is the biggest competitive advantage of its cloud business for the next 10 years How many TPUs does Google produce today, and how big can that get? Gemini 3 and the aftermath of Gemini 3 on the whole chip industry Let’s dive into it. The history of the TPU and why it all even started? The story of the Google Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) begins not with a breakthrough in chip manufacturing, but with a realization about math and logistics. Around 2013, Google’s leadership—specifically Jeff Dean, Jonathan Ross (the CEO of Groq), and the Google Brain team—ran a projection that alarmed them. They calculated that if every Android user utilized Google’s new voice search feature for just three minutes a day, the company would need to double its global data center capacity just to handle the compute load. At the time, Google was relying on standard CPUs and GPUs for these tasks. While powerful, these general-purpose chips were inefficient for the specific heavy lifting required by Deep Learning: massive matrix multiplications. Scaling up with existing hardware would have been a financial and logistical nightmare. This sparked a new project. Google decided to do something rare for a software company: build its own custom silicon. The goal was to create an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) designed for one job only: running TensorFlow neural networks. Key Historical Milestones: 2013-2014: The project moved really fast as Google both hired a very capable team and, to be honest, had some luck in their first steps. The team went from design concept to deploying silicon in data centers in just 15 months—a very short cycle for hardware engineering. 2015: Before the world knew they existed, TPUs were already powering Google’s most popular products. They were silently accelerating Google Maps navigation, Google Photos, and Google Translate. 2016: Google officially unveiled the TPU at Google I/O 2016. This urgency to solve the “data center doubling” problem is why the TPU exists. It wasn’t built to sell to gamers or render video; it was built to save Google from its own AI success. With that in mind, Google has been thinking about the »costly« AI inference problems for over a decade now. This is also one of the main reasons why the TPU is so good today compared to other ASIC projects. The difference between a TPU and a GPU? To understand the difference, it helps to look at what each chip was originally built to do. A GPU is a “general-purpose” parallel processor, while a TPU is a “domain-specific” architecture. The GPUs were designed for graphics. They excel at parallel processing (doing many things at once), which is great for AI. However, because they are designed to handle everything from video game textures to scientific simulations, they carry “architectural baggage.” They spend significant energy and chip area on complex tasks like caching, branch prediction, and managing independent threads. A TPU, on the other hand, strips away all that baggage. It has no hardware for rasterization or texture mapping. Instead, it uses a unique architecture called a Systolic Array. The “Systolic Array” is the key differentiator. In a standard CPU or GPU, the chip moves data back and forth between the memory and the computing units for every calculation. This constant shuffling creates a bottleneck (the Von Neumann bottleneck). In a TPU’s systolic array, data flows through the chip like blood through a heart (hence “systolic”). It loads data (weights) once. It passes inputs through a massive grid of multipliers. The data is passed directly to the next unit in the array without writing back to memory. What this means, in essence, is that a TPU, because of its systolic array, drastically reduces the number of memory reads and writes required from HBM. As a result, the TPU can spend its cycles computing rather than waiting for data. Google’s new TPU design, also called Ironwood also addressed some of the key areas where a TPU was lacking: They enhanced the SparseCore for efficiently handling large embeddings (good for recommendation systems and LLMs) It increased HBM capacity and bandwidth (up to 192 GB per chip). For a better understanding, Nvidia’s Blackwell B200 has 192GB per chip, while Blackwell Ultra, also known as the B300, has 288 GB per chip. Improved the Inter-Chip Interconnect (ICI) for linking thousands of chips into massive clusters, also called TPU Pods (needed for AI training as well as some time test compute inference workloads). When it comes to ICI, it is important to note that it is very performant with a Peak Bandwidth of 1.2 TB/s vs Blackwell NVLink 5 at 1.8 TB/s. But Google’s ICI, together with its specialized compiler and software stack, still delivers superior performance on some specific AI tasks. The key thing to understand is that because the TPU doesn’t need to decode complex instructions or constantly access memory, it can deliver significantly higher Operations Per Joule. For scale-out, Google uses Optical Circuit Switch (OCS) and its 3D torus network, which compete with Nvidia’s InfiniBand and Spectrum-X Ethernet. The main difference is that OCS is extremely cost-effective and power-efficient as it eliminates electrical switches and O-E-O conversions, but because of this, it is not as flexible as the other two. So again, the Google stack is extremely specialized for the task at hand and doesn’t offer the flexibility that GPUs do. Performance numbers TPU vs GPU? As we defined the differences, let’s look at real numbers showing how the TPU performs compared to the GPU. Since Google isn’t revealing these numbers, it is really hard to get details on performance. I studied many articles and alternative data sources, including interviews with industry insiders, and here are some of the key takeaways. The first important thing is that there is very limited information on Google’s newest TPUv7 (Ironwood), as Google introduced it in April 2025 and is just now starting to become available to external clients (internally, it is said that Google has already been using Ironwood since April, possibly even for Gemini 3.0.). And why is this important if we, for example, compare TPUv7 with an older but still widely used version of TPUv5p based on Semianalysis data: TPUv7 produces 4,614 TFLOPS(BF16) vs 459 TFLOPS for TPUv5p TPUv7 has 192GB of memory capacity vs TPUv5p 96GB TPUv7 memory Bandwidth is 7,370 GB/s vs 2,765 for v5p We can see that the performance leaps between v5 and v7 are very significant. To put that in context, most of the comments that we will look at are more focused on TPUv6 or TPUv5 than v7. Based on analyzing a ton of interviews with Former Google employees, customers, and competitors (people from AMD, NVDA & others), the summary of the results is as follows. Most agree that TPUs are more cost-effective compared to Nvidia GPUs, and most agree that the performance per watt for TPUs is better. This view is not applicable across all use cases tho. A Former Google Cloud employee: »If it is the right application, then they can deliver much better performance per dollar compared to GPUs. They also require much lesser energy and produces less heat compared to GPUs. They’re also more energy efficient and have a smaller environmental footprint, which is what makes them a desired outcome. The use cases are slightly limited to a GPU, they’re not as generic, but for a specific application, they can offer as much as 1.4X better performance per dollar, which is pretty significant saving for a customer that might be trying to use GPU versus TPUs.« source: AlphaSense Similarly, a very insightful comment from a Former Unit Head at Google around TPUs materially lowering AI-search cost per query vs GPUs: »TPU v6 is 60-65% more efficient than GPUs, prior generations 40-45%« This interview was in November 2024, so the expert is probably comparing the v6 TPU with the Nvidia Hopper. Today, we already have Blackwell vs V7. Many experts also mention the speed benefit that TPUs offer, with a Former Google Head saying that TPUs are 5x faster than GPUs for training dynamic models (like search-like workloads). There was also a very eye-opening interview with a client who used both Nvidia GPUs and Google TPUs as he describes the economics in great detail: »If I were to use eight H100s versus using one v5e pod, I would spend a lot less money on one v5e pod. In terms of price point money, performance per dollar, you will get more bang for TPU. If I already have a code, because of Google’s help or because of our own work, if I know it already is going to work on a TPU, then at that point it is beneficial for me to just stick with the TPU usage. In the long run, if I am thinking I need to write a new code base, I need to do a lot more work, then it depends on how long I’m going to train. I would say there is still some, for example, of the workload we have already done on TPUs that in the future because as Google will add newer generation of TPU, they make older ones much cheaper.For example, when they came out with v4, I remember the price of v2 came down so low that it was practically free to use compared to any NVIDIA GPUs. Google has got a good promise so they keep supporting older TPUs and they’re making it a lot cheaper. If you don’t really need your model trained right away, if you’re willing to say, “I can wait one week,” even though the training is only three days, then you can reduce your cost 1/5.« source: AlphaSense Another valuable interview was with a current AMD employee, acknowledging the benefits of ASICs: »I would expect that an AI accelerator could do about probably typically what we see in the industry. I’m using my experience at FPGAs. I could see a 30% reduction in size and maybe a 50% reduction in power vs a GPU.« We also got some numbers from a Former Google employee who worked in the chip segment: »When I look at the published numbers, they (TPUs) are anywhere from 25%-30% better to close to 2x better, depending on the use cases compared to Nvidia. Essentially, there’s a difference between a very custom design built to do one task perfectly versus a more general purpose design.« What is also known is that the real edge of TPUs lies not in the hardware but in the software and in the way Google has optimized its ecosystem for the TPU. A lot of people mention the problem that every Nvidia »competitor« like the TPU faces, which is the fast development of Nvidia and the constant »catching up« to Nvidia problem. This month a former Google Cloud employee addressed that concern head-on as he believes the rate at which TPUs are improving is faster than the rate at Nvidia: »The amount of performance per dollar that a TPU can generate from a new generation versus the old generation is a much significant jump than Nvidia« In addition, the recent data from Google’s presentation at the Hot Chips 2025 event backs that up, as Google stated that the TPUv7 is 100% better in performance per watt than their TPUv6e (Trillium). Even for hard Nvidia advocates, TPUs are not to be shrugged off easily, as even Jensen thinks very highly of Google’s TPUs. In a podcast with Brad Gerstner, he mentioned that when it comes to ASICs, Google with TPUs is a »special case«. A few months ago, we also got an article from the WSJ saying that after the news publication The Information published a report that stated that OpenAI had begun renting Google TPUs for ChatGPT, Jensen called Altman, asking him if it was true, and signaled that he was open to getting the talks back on track (investment talks). Also worth noting was that Nvidia’s official X account posted a screenshot of an article in which OpenAI denied plans to use Google’s in-house chips. To say the least, Nvidia is watching TPUs very closely. Ok, but after looking at some of these numbers, one might think, why aren’t more clients using TPUs? Where are the problems for the wider adoption of TPUs The main problem for TPUs adoption is the ecosystem. Nvidia’s CUDA is engraved in the minds of most AI engineers, as they have been learning CUDA in universities. Google has developed its ecosystem internally but not externally, as it has used TPUs only for its internal workloads until now. TPUs use a combination of JAX and TensorFlow, while the industry skews to CUDA and PyTorch (although TPUs also support PyTorch now). While Google is working hard to make its ecosystem more supportive and convertible with other stacks, it is also a matter of libraries and ecosystem formation that takes years to develop. It is also important to note that, until recently, the GenAI industry’s focus has largely been on training workloads. In training workloads, CUDA is very important, but when it comes to inference, even reasoning inference, CUDA is not that important, so the chances of expanding the TPU footprint in inference are much higher than those in training (although TPUs do really well in training as well – Gemini 3 the prime example). The fact that most clients are multi-cloud also poses a challenge for TPU adoption, as AI workloads are closely tied to data and its location (cloud data transfer is costly). Nvidia is accessible via all three hyperscalers, while TPUs are available only at GCP so far. A client who uses TPUs and Nvidia GPUs explains it well: »Right now, the one biggest advantage of NVIDIA, and this has been true for past three companies I worked on is because AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, these are the three major cloud companies. Every company, every corporate, every customer we have will have data in one of these three. All these three clouds have NVIDIA GPUs. Sometimes the data is so big and in a different cloud that it is a lot cheaper to run our workload in whatever cloud the customer has data in. I don’t know if you know about the egress cost that is moving data out of one cloud is one of the bigger cost. In that case, if you have NVIDIA workload, if you have a CUDA workload, we can just go to Microsoft Azure, get a VM that has NVIDIA GPU, same GPU in fact, no code change is required and just run it there. With TPUs, once you are all relied on TPU and Google says, “You know what? Now you have to pay 10X more,” then we would be screwed, because then we’ll have to go back and rewrite everything. That’s why. That’s the only reason people are afraid of committing too much on TPUs. The same reason is for Amazon’s Trainium and Inferentia.« source: AlphaSense These problems are well known at Google, so it is no surprise that internally, the debate over keeping TPUs inside Google or starting to sell them externally is a constant topic. When keeping them internally, it enhances the GCP moat, but at the same time, many former Google employees believe that at some point, Google will start offering TPUs externally as well, maybe through some neoclouds, not necessarily with the biggest two competitors, Microsoft and Amazon. Opening up the ecosystem, providing support, etc., and making it more widely usable are the first steps toward making that possible. A former Google employee also mentioned that Google last year formed a more sales-oriented team to push and sell TPUs, so it’s not like they have been pushing hard to sell TPUs for years; it is a fairly new dynamic in the organization. Google’s TPU is the biggest competitive advantage of its cloud business for the next 10 years The most valuable thing for me about TPUs is their impact on GCP. As we witness the transformation of cloud businesses from the pre-AI era to the AI era, the biggest takeaway is that the industry has gone from an oligopoly of AWS, Azure, and GCP to a more commoditized landscape, with Oracle, Coreweave, and many other neoclouds competing for AI workloads. The problem with AI workloads is the competition and Nvidia’s 75% gross margin, which also results in low margins for AI workloads. The cloud industry is moving from a 50-70% gross margin industry to a 20-35% gross margin industry. For cloud investors, this should be concerning, as the future profile of some of these companies is more like that of a utility than an attractive, high-margin business. But there is a solution to avoiding that future and returning to a normal margin: the ASIC. The cloud providers who can control the hardware and are not beholden to Nvidia and its 75% gross margin will be able to return to the world of 50% gross margins. And there is no surprise that all three AWS, Azure, and GCP are developing their own ASICs. The most mature by far is Google’s TPU, followed by Amazon’s Trainum, and lastly Microsoft’s MAIA (although Microsoft owns the full IP of OpenAI’s custom ASICs, which could help them in the future). While even with ASICs you are not 100% independent, as you still have to work with someone like Broadcom or Marvell, whose margins are lower than Nvidia’s but still not negligible, Google is again in a very good position. Over the years of developing TPUs, Google has managed to control much of the chip design process in-house. According to a current AMD employee, Broadcom no longer knows everything about the chip. At this point, Google is the front-end designer (the actual RTL of the design) while Broadcom is only the backend physical design partner. Google, on top of that, also, of course, owns the entire software optimization stack for the chip, which makes it as performant as it is. According to the AMD employee, based on this work split, he thinks Broadcom is lucky if it gets a 50-point gross margin on its part. Without having to pay Nvidia for the accelerator, a cloud provider can either price its compute similarly to others and maintain a better margin profile or lower costs and gain market share. Of course, all of this depends on having a very capable ASIC that can compete with Nvidia. Unfortunately, it looks like Google is the only one that has achieved that, as the number one-performing model is Gemini 3 trained on TPUs. According to some former Google employees, internally, Google is also using TPUs for inference across its entire AI stack, including Gemini and models like Veo. Google buys Nvidia GPUs for GCP, as clients want them because they are familiar with them and the ecosystem, but internally, Google is full-on with TPUs. As the complexity of each generation of ASICs increases, similar to the complexity and pace of Nvidia, I predict that not all ASIC programs will make it. I believe outside of TPUs, the only real hyperscaler shot right now is AWS Trainium, but even that faces much bigger uncertainties than the TPU. With that in mind, Google and its cloud business can come out of this AI era as a major beneficiary and market-share gainer. Recently, we even got comments from the SemiAnalysis team praising the TPU: »Google’s silicon supremacy among hyperscalers is unmatched, with their TPU 7th Gen arguably on par with Nvidia Blackwell. TPU powers the Gemini family of models which are improving in capability and sit close to the pareto frontier of $ per intelligence in some tasks« source: SemiAnalysis How many TPUs does Google produce today, and how big can that get? Here are the numbers that I researched:

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Cyber Monday is here, and there are lots of deals to choose from, including these excellent discounts on the Apple products we recommend: Today’s best Apple deals: U.S. Today’s best Apple deals: U.K. Updated December 1: We have reviewed the best prices and found more price drops and changes. We will be regularly monitoring the best prices and will update this article throughout Cyber Monday. ‘Tis the season for savings! Whether you’re looking for a deal on an iPad, Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods, or anything else Apple sells, there’s no better time to get one for cheap than Black Friday. The annual shopping extravaganza officially kicked off on Friday, but many of the best deals will last until today, AKA Cyber Monday on December 1. Every retailer that sells Apple gear gets in on the fun, and we are rounding up only the best deals we find right here. We regularly check prices using various tools to get a view of the very best prices right now, compared to what they were over the past days, weeks, and months, so we know an excellent deal when we see it. We’re checking and updating these prices all weekend, so mark this page and return often so you don’t miss a good deal, some of which are short-lived. Even Apple runs its own Black Friday shopping event, where it offers gift cards on certain purchases, including $50 with AirPods Pro 3, $100 for iPad Air, and $250 with a MacBook Pro. The bottom line is that there are lots of deals to be found right now, so no matter what Apple device you’re looking for, you will be able to make a saving. So take a look at the deals on all of Apple’s products below. Also, check our Best Picks round-ups, where you can find reviews of all the products we recommend. At Macworld we’ve been covering and reviewing Apple and Apple devices for more than 40 years, from the original Macintosh to the most recent M5 MacBook Pro and iPhone 17 lineup. We use Apple products every day and purchase them with our own money, so we know a good deal when we see one. More importantly, we also know how to spot a bad deal. With a working knowledge of everything Apple sells and decades of experience, we know when stores are inflating prices or pushing “normal” sales as limited Black Friday deals, so the listings you see here will only be for discounts that are at or near all-time low prices. Macworld Cyber Monday tip: While shopping during the Black Friday sales, we’ve noticed that on Amazon, if you delay your delivery date, there are additional 2-3% savings to be had. This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart, then it can add up to decent savings. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than last Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $150 off it’s a good saving (but it was $200 earlier in the Black Friday sale). We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 did dip as low as $139 at Walmart, but that deal seems to have ended now, the next best option is $189 on Amazon. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 was superb, but stock seems to have run out now (check to see if the model is user). You can still get AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation for less than $100, which is an excellent deal. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that AirPods deals sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers can save money on the AirPods Pro 2, currently at £169 with Argos, but we’ve also seen them at that price on Amazon (but they go out of stock quickly!). Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’ve seen $150 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. The standard entry-level iPad A16 is an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $275, but stock is dwindling, so if you want one act fast. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) (which has run out now) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Cyber Monday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or £74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 off/£20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats. You might also find some deals among our best earbuds for iPhones and Best over-ear headphones. U.S. U.K. Apple holds a shopping event every Black Friday, but it doesn’t offer actual discounts. Instead, Apple gives away gift cards when you buy certain products, which can be used on a future purchase. In 2025, Apple is offering the following gift card values over Black Friday weekend: This years deal is better than last year’s, with a maximum of $250/£200 being given away in the form of gift vouchers, and in some cases, such as the iPhones, we are seeing better savings via Apple than elsewhere.

SP Lover's notes SIMON_ Matrix Featured Article Matrix is the writing community of SSPAI, where we encourage sharing authentic product experiences, practical insights, and thoughtful reflections. We regularly feature the finest Matrix articles to showcase genuine perspectives from real users. The article represents the author’s personal views. SSPAI has only made minor edits to the title and formatting.Featured on the Matrix homepage 2025 marks my fifth year in Japan. Ever since I moved here in 2021, I’ve made it a habit to review my yearly spending at the end of each year and share the items I used most frequently and enjoyed the most. This year is no exception. Rather than a “best-of” product list, it’s more like a reflection on my year. Since I continued traveling frequently in 2025, my spending still leaned toward outdoor and lifestyle items, with very little interest in upgrading tech gadgets. So once again, the “Lifestyle” section comes first — if you’re only here for the “Tech” part, feel free to scroll straight down. Following my principle that “there is no perfect product,” this year’s list also includes a brief “downsides” section for each item to help give a more balanced impression. And because I want to save you the trouble of hunting down prices and where to buy things, I’ll do my best to include a reference price1 and purchase channel2 under each recommendation. The North Face Expedition Series Parka A parka warm enough to handle –20°C, and it accompanied me through the harsh winters of two Northeasts (China’s Northeast and Japan’s Tōhoku) as well as Hokkaido. The reason I chose this jacket is simple: among down jackets, it has the best silhouette, and among parkas, it’s one of the warmest. As one of the premium offerings from The North Face Japan line, this coat features nearly all of their signature technologies: GORE-TEX (2-layer, not 3-layer), PERTEX Quantum (originally used for UK parachutes, later acquired by Mitsui Japan), CLEANDOWN (high-cleanliness down from a long-established Mie Prefecture manufacturer), and Photon Thermo (The North Face Japan’s go-to thermal tech — essentially far-infrared). It may not be the ultimate top-tier product, but it’s extremely versatile and dependable for cold regions. It also frequently goes on sale, so I recommend waiting for discounts to get the best value. Downsides: The jacket is heavy; harder to pack than typical down jackets; faux fur hood trim is mediocre; the new model (ND92546) costs ¥2,000 more without noticeable improvements. ARC’TERYX Gamma MX Hoody This year, aside from shells, I bought quite a bit of Arc’teryx: wool socks, gloves, Gamma pants and tops, quick-dry tees, Atom jackets, hats — basically one of each iconic item. Among everything I’ve tried, the Gamma series is the most worth buying. It has repeatedly appeared on “Best Outdoor Softshell” lists and is often sold out. The Gamma MX I purchased was originally designed as a close-fitting piece for ice climbing, but in recent years the fit has been updated to a more relaxed style, making it suitable for all body types and everyday wear. Details are excellent for this price point: Fortius™ 2.0 fabric for wind resistance and light water repellency with breathability; reinforced glued seams at the hem and hood; windproof cuffs; and a fleeced interior for warmth in spring and autumn. The reason I recommend the Gamma series: it’s one of the few Arc’teryx lines that genuinely works across multiple scenarios. With three different thicknesses available, there’s an option for both northern and southern climates. In spring and fall, it works perfectly as an outer layer; in winter or during outdoor activities, pairing it with a down jacket or hardshell turns it into a warm and reliable mid-layer. The Fortius™ fabric is very stretchy — great for outdoor sports and commuting — and the light water resistance is enough for Japan’s rainy season. The more straightforward reason I bought it this year: the new olive-green color was simply irresistible. Downsides: Expensive. The avalanche incident earlier this year severely damaged the brand’s reputation, and I strongly disapprove of that behavior. However, based on the Arc’teryx events I’ve attended in Japan, their Japan operations are still outstanding. EVERGOODS × Carryology MPL22 Backpack When looking for a new backpack this year, I compared popular brands such as Aer, Able Carry, ALPAKA, and Matador. But considering my actual needs — a pack suitable for both inter-city commuting and light hiking around urban outskirts — I ultimately chose the EVERGOODS MPL22. The MPL22 is designed specifically to transition seamlessly between mountain trails and city streets, making it a perfect match for my use cases. The only issue: the standard MPL22 uses 420d nylon, which doesn’t have the same crisp, structured look as X-Pac and looks a bit too plain in full black. Appearance-wise, it simply didn’t excite me. The collaboration edition I eventually bought upgrades the material to ULTRA 200TX — an ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fabric — offering full waterproofing and exceptional strength. The gray exterior has a refined titanium-like sheen under light, paired with a bright blue interior (TX70 ULTRA), a color combination I really love. In addition, several small design details were upgraded from the standard version:• A metal Velcro patch featuring the Krudde (a fearsome creature from Dutch folklore)• YKK’s high-performance RC-series water-resistant zippers• Anodized aluminum hardware• A fully suspended laptop compartment• A hidden pocket designed to store an AirTagAnd many more thoughtful touches — too many to list here. Interested readers can refer to the official making-of notes and videos linked later. After several months of use, whether hiking, trekking, or commuting, I remain extremely satisfied with this bag. Its 22L capacity is just right — never bulky. The adjustable sternum strap adapts well to my body, offering excellent carrying comfort. The internal pocket layout is also very smart, allowing every piece of my EDC to find its perfect spot. If you’re curious about this backpack, check out the official YouTube video or the detailed manufacturing notes to understand its design philosophy and construction. Downsides: The collaboration model is expensive — the standard version offers far better value. Also, the lack of a luggage pass-through strap is a notable regret. YAMANO3 Flower MOUNTAIN × NANGA Outdoor Shoes Flower MOUNTAIN is a relatively niche brand. Although I’d been aware of it for a while, it didn’t truly enter my radar until this collaboration with the Japanese outdoor brand NANGA. I saw this pair in person at NANGA’s Harajuku store — my first impression was that the design looked striking and the craftsmanship appeared refined. After trying them on and finding the comfort surprisingly good, I decided to buy them. Compared with the regular YAMANO3, the collaboration model features two major upgrades: What also appealed to me was the Microban lining, which provides antibacterial and deodorizing properties, and the cork insole, which offers excellent moisture absorption. The shoes I initially bought purely for their looks have now accompanied me up Mount Asahi and Mount Kuro, and have been worn for multiple outdoor hikes and rainy-day strolls. Similar to the backpack mentioned earlier, I’d describe these shoes as suitable for both city streetwear and light outdoor use. Overall, it’s a collaboration that balances style and function — matching NANGA’s outdoor DNA while retaining Flower MOUNTAIN’s distinctly Japanese aesthetic. Downsides: Due to the waterproof materials, breathability is somewhat limited, making them better suited for autumn and winter. They are intended for light outdoor activities rather than professional-level hiking. KEEN HYPERPORT CLOG LEATHER KEEN, a Japanese brand, released this all-season clog in 2025. Known for its near-obsessive dedication to sandal design (alongside its outdoor line), KEEN launches countless sandal models each year—yet none have ever truly appealed to me aesthetically. This year’s model, however, feels like a hybrid between a Birkenstock clog and something uniquely KEEN. The upper is made of leather and equipped with an easily adjustable buckle for a secure fit outdoors. The outsole uses the brand’s own Aquagrip rubber for reliable slip resistance. What convinced me to choose this pair was simple: more affordable than Birkenstocks, and much easier to style. After wearing them for a full year, I can say they are extremely comfortable. The toe box is wide enough for natural movement, and the thick midsole makes them far more suitable for outdoor casual use compared to regular slippers. Shopping, commuting—no problem at all. Two Brands: SHIRO & LINC CORPORATION This year, my skincare trials revolved mainly around two brands from Hokkaido: SHIRO and LINC ORIGINAL MAKERS. SHIRO is known for its natural ingredients and signature “transparent freshness.” The FREESIA MIST continues this tradition with a fresh fragrance profile: a bright fruity opening of apple and apricot, a floral mid-note, and a subtle woody base. The texture is thin and spreads smoothly, leaving the skin with a moisturized, subtly glossy finish once absorbed. LINC also highlights naturally derived scents. The No. 997 hand cream I picked leans fruity as well. According to the brand, the top notes bring a sweet-tart orchard freshness; the middle notes blend the clarity of geranium and lily of the valley, like sunlight filtering through grass; the base introduces a soft sandalwood reminiscent of a tranquil forest breeze. In practice, the sandalwood lingers the longest (a bit similar to LE LABO’s newly released Santal 33?), refined and non-greasy. Compared to SHIRO, the LINC cream has a thicker texture and longer-lasting scent. Downsides: SHIRO’s fragrance can become cloying over time—or, as many say, may smell a bit “cheap.” Best to try it in person if possible. Costco 93% Duck Down Comforter This winter has been one of the colder ones in Japan, so I picked up this duck down comforter while it was on sale at Costco. The biggest change it brought is that the entire winter, getting into bed felt like sinking into a hotel duvet—extremely comfortable. The best thing about down comforters is that they’re warm yet lightweight. The duck down filling is also of high cleanliness with no unpleasant odor whatsoever. I bought the 1 kg version with 95% duck down fill, and there’s also a goose-down option. Regardless of version, all the down is certified by CIL (Comprehensive Sleep Institute), meets RDS international standards, and is processed with Aller G Plus deodorizing and antibacterial treatment. Being able to trust the filling is the biggest reason I recommend it. In Japan, Japanese-made down comforters often cost over ¥100,000 (e.g., Nishikawa). This Costco comforter is a breath of fresh air—affordable, and even discounted during winter. My final purchase price was ¥12,980, making it incredibly cost-effective. Downsides: None so far. Bellroy Lite Duffel Gym Bag This is a gym bag with excellent texture and craftsmanship, supporting two carrying modes: hand-carry and shoulder-carry (with a detachable strap included). The interior is well-organized, with two bottle pockets and two small item pockets; there’s a built-in AirTag pocket; and the bag can be folded down into a compact size when not in use. The capacity is just right for me. The exterior fabric is water-repellent and has successfully protected my belongings through several surprise downpours; the bag itself is lightweight, making it perfect for going back and forth between home and the gym. Downsides: Expensive at full price. No dedicated shoe compartment. As a travel bag, it lacks a strap to secure it onto a suitcase handle. Patagonia Capilene® Cool Daily Shirt Quick-Dry Baselayer Thanks to the fitness habit I mentioned earlier, I tried quite a few base layer brands this year: Lululemon, Mizuno, Arc’teryx, Montbell and so on. After comparing these, the one most worth recommending is Patagonia’s C1 quick-dry. That’s almost stating the obvious—anyone who knows Patagonia a bit probably already knows that one of their must-try products is the Capilene C1 quick-dry series. The reason I recommend it is that it strikes a great balance between price and performance: it feels great to wear, has excellent quick-drying and odor-control capabilities, comes with a tear-off care label, and is reasonably priced. As for other brands, if we ignore price, Arc’teryx’s Konseal Pocket quick-dry series would probably be my top pick. Unfortunately, the price is high enough to buy at least two pieces from other brands, so I’m not including it in the recommendation list. Downside: It does nothing to hide your body shape—any “flaws” will be fully exposed. Kao Steam Eye Mask (Lavender Scent) An old product in new packaging. A friend once randomly gave me one to try, and I’ve been hooked ever since. These Kao steam eye masks have kept me company through many nights, as well as countless breaks on long bus and plane rides. They’re designed as single-use, so they’re very lightweight, easy to carry, and you just toss them after use—super convenient. There is an unscented version, but I still prefer the scented ones, especially lavender and osmanthus; those scents make it easier for me to slip into a relaxed, sleepy state. Of course, this is very subjective, but it works extremely well for me. Downside: None for now. Mitsubishi Uni-ball Zento Sign Pen The magnetic cap is dangerously addictive—you’ll find yourself clicking it open and shut nonstop. The pen itself has a metal body with a matte coating, giving it a premium feel. The newly developed ZENTO ink includes a “POA surfactant,” which reduces friction against paper even further, resulting in an exceptionally smooth writing experience and minimal ghosting. The weight distribution of the pen has also been adjusted so that the center of gravity sits near the web of your hand, making it comfortable even during extended writing sessions. The overall balance is excellent—you can almost feel that “the pen moves with your mind” smoothness the moment you pick it up. Downside: Pricey. If you just want to try the smooth ink, the standard model is enough. THE SUPERIOR LABOR Wallet In my earlier article “Three Years with a Backpack: My Travel Gear List,” I mentioned wanting a short wallet to replace the long one I had been using. My options at the time were RE:FORM and Bellroy, but the former’s material attracts dust easily, while the latter doesn’t fit well with Japan’s coin-heavy payment habits. Just in time for THE SUPERIOR LABOR’s year-end sale, I picked up this classic Japanese-style wallet at a great price. I call it a “Japanese wallet” mainly because of two features (which also made me choose it): First, despite being a bi-fold wallet with limited space, it includes a coin pocket that opens at a wide angle—perfect for Japan’s cash-centered society. In my case I rarely use coins, so I use this pocket to store my AirTag instead. Second, the craftsmanship. This wallet is made from Japanese Black Wagyu leather, often called the “black diamond of the leather world.” It is tanned using the traditional shironameshi method, which avoids chemical agents and instead uses natural materials like shell ash, salt, and oils. The coloring is done with urushi-nuri, a technique that uses lacquer tree sap. Both methods are traditional techniques and very much reflect Japanese craftsmanship philosophy. Downside: Because of the coin-pocket design, the wallet is on the thicker side. As always, here are some food and drink recommendations to wrap up the lifestyle section: IYOSHI COLA Japan’s version of Laoshan Cola: a cola base infused with traditional herbal ingredients, essentially a medicinal-style Coca-Cola. If you enjoy Laoshan Cola, you’ll almost certainly like Iyoshi Cola—the herbal taste is even stronger, and you’ll often find a bit of herbal sediment at the bottom. This is the kind of drink people either absolutely love or flat-out hate. If you’re a fan of herbal flavors, it’s definitely worth a try. Iyoshi Cola has easily become the drink I consume most frequently this year—nothing else even comes close. Downside: Expensive; the distinctive medicinal flavor can be off-putting for some. Tokyo Milk Cheese Factory Cookies One of my favorite snacks this year. They come in a variety of flavors; my personal picks are Truffle & Cheddar (savory-sweet) and Uji Matcha (sweet). The cookies look a bit like Shiroi Koibito, but taste much better: crisp yet not dry, with smooth, layered fillings that never feel cloying. The Truffle & Cheddar flavor has a subtle savory aroma, with the truffle fragrance blending harmoniously—perfect when paired with black tea as an afternoon treat. The Uji Matcha version balances a gentle bitterness with the soft sweetness of mascarpone, resulting in a wonderfully delicate flavor profile. Downside: Uses no animal butter; the ingredient list is noticeably long… Then let’s talk about two things that aren’t practical but add emotional value: Alapaka 9th Anniversary Limited-Edition Patch A limited-edition badge collection released for ALPAKA’s 9th anniversary. The brand invited nine renowned street artists from around the world, each offering their own creative interpretation of ALPAKA’s core theme — “Keep Moving Forward.” Each patch has a completely different style, and I switch them around on my various accessory bags. No deeper reason — they just look cool. We Are Twinkle People I bought some Pop Mart stock earlier this year and sold too early. Recently I discovered that the Twinkle figures are way too cute. When I’m in a bad mood, giving the little Twinkle guy a squish instantly lifts my spirits. No major purpose — just emotional value as a little “gift back” to Pop Mart for that stock. The rest is pure serotonin. This year’s tech section can be summed up as “nothing remarkable.” My usual habit of upgrading my iPhone annually was interrupted — although I did buy the latest iPhone 17 Pro Max, I immediately sold it to a buyback shop. Overall, I’ve hit a “vacuum phase” with electronics, feeling little motivation to replace or upgrade anything throughout the year. DJI Action 5 Pro As I mentioned in My Travel Gear List After Three Years of Backpacking, the main purpose of this purchase was to replace my old GoPro 9 — pairing it with a car mount for road-trip scenery, or a neck mount for hiking and trekking logs. The 30,000-yen purchase price plus points made it a great deal. The compact body is easy to carry, and compared with my old GoPro, the magnetic mounting system saves a lot of hassle during setup and removal Downside: DJI released the Action 6 at the end of this year, making the 5 Pro an older model. Personally, though, I don’t see a strong reason to upgrade. Panasonic ES-PV3A Electric Shaver A frequent appearance in my recommendations this year. Lightweight, long-lasting battery, USB-C charging — all solid selling points. But the real highlight is how incredibly compact it is: super portable without compromising shaving performance. I’ve tried Braun’s foil shavers before, but had to switch back to Philips after developing a nickel allergy to Braun’s foil. Panasonic’s ES-PV3A, however, contains no nickel, and its foil head shaves noticeably cleaner than Philips’ rotary design. It has become an absolute essential for my trips this year. Downside: Zhitai Portable SSD Because of work, I’ve used portable drives from Samsung, SanDisk, LaCie, and others. Earlier this year, I bought my first domestically made portable SSD — the Zhitai. After nearly a year of heavy usage (storing large quantities of photos and videos, long continuous data transfers), it has remained extremely stable and reliable. Compared with Samsung’s T7 series, the Zhitai drive is cheaper and faster. While long-term durability still needs more time to judge, its performance so far has been excellent. The included dual-head data cable and surprisingly good-quality carrying case also add extra value to the overall package. Nitecore EDC23 Flashlight Since rural areas in Japan often lack streetlights — and because I frequently walk mountain roads at night — I still need a compact flashlight for safety. The EDC23’s flat, compact design is highly portable, yet it can instantly burst to 2,500 lumens of brightness. USB-C charging is another major convenience, saving me from carrying a proprietary cable. I also bought two other popular models this year — the SK-05 and Xiaomi’s multifunction portable flashlight. Both perform well, but due to size differences, neither is as convenient to carry as the EDC23, so I’ll leave them out for now. Downside:The 2,550-lumen turbo mode only lasts a few seconds before the flashlight forces a cooldown. Razer Pro Click V2 Ergonomic Mouse I bought this as a replacement for my current Logitech MX Vertical ergonomic mouse. Compared with the MX Vertical, the Pro Click V2 is better suited for users with larger hands. Once you get used to Razer’s grip style, you’ll find that its mold design is more reasonable and comfortable than the MX Vertical. The matte plastic shell is also a huge advantage for someone like me with “acidic hands”—it doesn’t get corroded or damaged by sweat the way the rubber coating on the MX Vertical does. In addition, its DPI is significantly higher than Logitech’s, making cursor movements more responsive and precise, especially on high-resolution monitors or multi-screen setups. Downside:Just like Logitech’s office drivers, Razer’s software is terrible. The mouse also has a built-in RGB light—if you leave it on, battery life drops drastically. When connected via Bluetooth, wake-from-sleep is noticeably slower than Logitech’s. This is both the conclusion and the disclaimer. Everything listed above represents items that I personally selected with great care throughout the year — but my definition of “good products” is entirely subjective. These items are simply what best fit me, not necessarily what will fit everyone. If anything here gives you even a little inspiration, then that alone makes this article worthwhile. There is no such thing as a perfect product, but I hope this 2025 favorites roundup offers you a broader reference range for your future purchases.

SP Lover's notes SIMON_ Matrix Featured Article Matrix is the writing community of SSPAI, where we encourage sharing authentic product experiences, practical insights, and thoughtful reflections. We regularly feature the finest Matrix articles to showcase genuine perspectives from real users. The article represents the author’s personal views. SSPAI has only made minor edits to the title and formatting.Featured on the Matrix homepage 2025 marks my fifth year in Japan. Ever since I moved here in 2021, I’ve made it a habit to review my yearly spending at the end of each year and share the items I used most frequently and enjoyed the most. This year is no exception. Rather than a “best-of” product list, it’s more like a reflection on my year. Since I continued traveling frequently in 2025, my spending still leaned toward outdoor and lifestyle items, with very little interest in upgrading tech gadgets. So once again, the “Lifestyle” section comes first — if you’re only here for the “Tech” part, feel free to scroll straight down. Following my principle that “there is no perfect product,” this year’s list also includes a brief “downsides” section for each item to help give a more balanced impression. And because I want to save you the trouble of hunting down prices and where to buy things, I’ll do my best to include a reference price1 and purchase channel2 under each recommendation. The North Face Expedition Series Parka A parka warm enough to handle –20°C, and it accompanied me through the harsh winters of two Northeasts (China’s Northeast and Japan’s Tōhoku) as well as Hokkaido. The reason I chose this jacket is simple: among down jackets, it has the best silhouette, and among parkas, it’s one of the warmest. As one of the premium offerings from The North Face Japan line, this coat features nearly all of their signature technologies: GORE-TEX (2-layer, not 3-layer), PERTEX Quantum (originally used for UK parachutes, later acquired by Mitsui Japan), CLEANDOWN (high-cleanliness down from a long-established Mie Prefecture manufacturer), and Photon Thermo (The North Face Japan’s go-to thermal tech — essentially far-infrared). It may not be the ultimate top-tier product, but it’s extremely versatile and dependable for cold regions. It also frequently goes on sale, so I recommend waiting for discounts to get the best value. Downsides: The jacket is heavy; harder to pack than typical down jackets; faux fur hood trim is mediocre; the new model (ND92546) costs ¥2,000 more without noticeable improvements. ARC’TERYX Gamma MX Hoody This year, aside from shells, I bought quite a bit of Arc’teryx: wool socks, gloves, Gamma pants and tops, quick-dry tees, Atom jackets, hats — basically one of each iconic item. Among everything I’ve tried, the Gamma series is the most worth buying. It has repeatedly appeared on “Best Outdoor Softshell” lists and is often sold out. The Gamma MX I purchased was originally designed as a close-fitting piece for ice climbing, but in recent years the fit has been updated to a more relaxed style, making it suitable for all body types and everyday wear. Details are excellent for this price point: Fortius™ 2.0 fabric for wind resistance and light water repellency with breathability; reinforced glued seams at the hem and hood; windproof cuffs; and a fleeced interior for warmth in spring and autumn. The reason I recommend the Gamma series: it’s one of the few Arc’teryx lines that genuinely works across multiple scenarios. With three different thicknesses available, there’s an option for both northern and southern climates. In spring and fall, it works perfectly as an outer layer; in winter or during outdoor activities, pairing it with a down jacket or hardshell turns it into a warm and reliable mid-layer. The Fortius™ fabric is very stretchy — great for outdoor sports and commuting — and the light water resistance is enough for Japan’s rainy season. The more straightforward reason I bought it this year: the new olive-green color was simply irresistible. Downsides: Expensive. The avalanche incident earlier this year severely damaged the brand’s reputation, and I strongly disapprove of that behavior. However, based on the Arc’teryx events I’ve attended in Japan, their Japan operations are still outstanding. EVERGOODS × Carryology MPL22 Backpack When looking for a new backpack this year, I compared popular brands such as Aer, Able Carry, ALPAKA, and Matador. But considering my actual needs — a pack suitable for both inter-city commuting and light hiking around urban outskirts — I ultimately chose the EVERGOODS MPL22. The MPL22 is designed specifically to transition seamlessly between mountain trails and city streets, making it a perfect match for my use cases. The only issue: the standard MPL22 uses 420d nylon, which doesn’t have the same crisp, structured look as X-Pac and looks a bit too plain in full black. Appearance-wise, it simply didn’t excite me. The collaboration edition I eventually bought upgrades the material to ULTRA 200TX — an ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fabric — offering full waterproofing and exceptional strength. The gray exterior has a refined titanium-like sheen under light, paired with a bright blue interior (TX70 ULTRA), a color combination I really love. In addition, several small design details were upgraded from the standard version:• A metal Velcro patch featuring the Krudde (a fearsome creature from Dutch folklore)• YKK’s high-performance RC-series water-resistant zippers• Anodized aluminum hardware• A fully suspended laptop compartment• A hidden pocket designed to store an AirTagAnd many more thoughtful touches — too many to list here. Interested readers can refer to the official making-of notes and videos linked later. After several months of use, whether hiking, trekking, or commuting, I remain extremely satisfied with this bag. Its 22L capacity is just right — never bulky. The adjustable sternum strap adapts well to my body, offering excellent carrying comfort. The internal pocket layout is also very smart, allowing every piece of my EDC to find its perfect spot. If you’re curious about this backpack, check out the official YouTube video or the detailed manufacturing notes to understand its design philosophy and construction. Downsides: The collaboration model is expensive — the standard version offers far better value. Also, the lack of a luggage pass-through strap is a notable regret. YAMANO3 Flower MOUNTAIN × NANGA Outdoor Shoes Flower MOUNTAIN is a relatively niche brand. Although I’d been aware of it for a while, it didn’t truly enter my radar until this collaboration with the Japanese outdoor brand NANGA. I saw this pair in person at NANGA’s Harajuku store — my first impression was that the design looked striking and the craftsmanship appeared refined. After trying them on and finding the comfort surprisingly good, I decided to buy them. Compared with the regular YAMANO3, the collaboration model features two major upgrades: What also appealed to me was the Microban lining, which provides antibacterial and deodorizing properties, and the cork insole, which offers excellent moisture absorption. The shoes I initially bought purely for their looks have now accompanied me up Mount Asahi and Mount Kuro, and have been worn for multiple outdoor hikes and rainy-day strolls. Similar to the backpack mentioned earlier, I’d describe these shoes as suitable for both city streetwear and light outdoor use. Overall, it’s a collaboration that balances style and function — matching NANGA’s outdoor DNA while retaining Flower MOUNTAIN’s distinctly Japanese aesthetic. Downsides: Due to the waterproof materials, breathability is somewhat limited, making them better suited for autumn and winter. They are intended for light outdoor activities rather than professional-level hiking. KEEN HYPERPORT CLOG LEATHER KEEN, a Japanese brand, released this all-season clog in 2025.

After nearly a year of heavy usage (storing large quantities of photos and videos, long continuous data transfers), it has remained extremely stable and reliable. Compared with Samsung’s T7 series, the Zhitai drive is cheaper and faster. While long-term durability still needs more time to judge, its performance so far has been excellent. The included dual-head data cable and surprisingly good-quality carrying case also add extra value to the overall package. Nitecore EDC23 Flashlight Since rural areas in Japan often lack streetlights — and because I frequently walk mountain roads at night — I still need a compact flashlight for safety. The EDC23’s flat, compact design is highly portable, yet it can instantly burst to 2,500 lumens of brightness. USB-C charging is another major convenience, saving me from carrying a proprietary cable. I also bought two other popular models this year — the SK-05 and Xiaomi’s multifunction portable flashlight. Both perform well, but due to size differences, neither is as convenient to carry as the EDC23, so I’ll leave them out for now. Downside:The 2,550-lumen turbo mode only lasts a few seconds before the flashlight forces a cooldown. Razer Pro Click V2 Ergonomic Mouse I bought this as a replacement for my current Logitech MX Vertical ergonomic mouse. Compared with the MX Vertical, the Pro Click V2 is better suited for users with larger hands. Once you get used to Razer’s grip style, you’ll find that its mold design is more reasonable and comfortable than the MX Vertical. The matte plastic shell is also a huge advantage for someone like me with “acidic hands”—it doesn’t get corroded or damaged by sweat the way the rubber coating on the MX Vertical does. In addition, its DPI is significantly higher than Logitech’s, making cursor movements more responsive and precise, especially on high-resolution monitors or multi-screen setups. Downside:Just like Logitech’s office drivers, Razer’s software is terrible. The mouse also has a built-in RGB light—if you leave it on, battery life drops drastically. When connected via Bluetooth, wake-from-sleep is noticeably slower than Logitech’s. This is both the conclusion and the disclaimer. Everything listed above represents items that I personally selected with great care throughout the year — but my definition of “good products” is entirely subjective. These items are simply what best fit me, not necessarily what will fit everyone. If anything here gives you even a little inspiration, then that alone makes this article worthwhile.

Title: Nvidia's bumpy November

Every time Brent D. Griffiths publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nvidia's sterling armor was dented this month. After years of meteoric success, the chipmaker and its CEO Jensen Huang have increasingly found themselves playing defense — an unusual position for the company. Nvidia headed into the month with its stock price at an all-time high, bolstered by increasing AI spending from some of its major Big Tech customers like Meta, Microsoft, and Google. Huang was hot off of Nvidia's GTC conference in Washington, where he dismissed any concerns of an AI bubble and sounded jubilant. But over the course of the month, which saw Nvidia shed 11% of its value, the chipmaker has gone from smashing earnings and alleviating Wall Street's AI bubble fears to becoming the poster boy of what some analysts view as a company on an unsustainable path. Nvidia has also had to fend off short-sellers and the growing threat of Google, picking up some bruises along the way. Big names, including SoftBank and Peter Thiel, cashed out on the Wall Street darling that had became the world's first $4 trillion market cap company mere months ago. SoftBank announced it fully exited its Nvidia position, selling $5.8 billion in shares to bet on OpenAI. And while its CFO stressed it had "nothing to do with Nvidia itself," the move didn't exactly dispel the ongoing AI bubble talk. Nvidia defiantly pushed back on any investor skittishness when it released its third-quarter earnings on November 19, surpassing analysts' already lofty expectations — no small feat — at a time when concerns about the AI bubble were once again creeping up. "There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," Huang told analysts on a call following the results. "From our vantage point, we see something very different." But while shares rallied in after-hours trading following the results, markets did a U-turn the following day as hand-wringing over ballooning tech valuations and spending continued. Behind closed doors, Huang privately told employees in remarks first reported by Business Insider that "the market did not appreciate" Nvidia's "incredible" quarter. Facing sky-high expectations and the position of being a bellwether for the AI industry, Huang described the chipmaker as being in a somewhat no-win situation. "If we delivered a bad quarter, it is evidence there's an AI bubble. If we delivered a great quarter, we are fueling the AI bubble," Huang said during an all-hands meeting. It didn't take long for things to get a bit choppy for the chipmaker. Shares of Nvidia fell after The Information reported that Google was engaged in talks with Meta to provide the social network billions worth of the tech giant's own advanced chips. While Nvidia's chips have long been the gold standard in the AI race, a hot commodity used by tech giants and startups to train and run LLMs and chatbots, the news suggested that the chipmaker's market share might be under threat. With Google now eyeing Nvidia's lunch, the market digested a possible future where Nvidia may no longer be the star attraction. Nvidia's market losses following the news appeared to be Google's gain, with its parent company Alphabet now positioned to join the $4 trillion club that Nvidia started. And in a move that raised some eyebrows, Nvidia released a mostly defiant statement that praised Google's success but said Nvidia's chips are "a generation ahead of the industry." The developments acted as fuel for Michael Burry of "The Big Short" fame, who has become increasingly vocal about voicing his doubts about Nvidia. Burry, who has a particularly dour view of the AI industry, spent much of the month questioning the longevity of Nvidia's chips, its stock dilution, and its circular, "give-and-take deals" in AI. The investor recently leaned into online writing and labeled Nvidia as the Cisco of the AI bubble era in one of his first Substack posts. "And once again there is a Cisco at the center of it all, with the picks and shovels for all and the expansive vision to go with it," Burry wrote. "Its name is Nvidia." The chipmaker didn't take the criticism lying down. In a note to Wall Street sell-side analysts, a copy of which was obtained by Business Insider, Nvidia took exception to Burry's claims, stating that he appeared to have "incorrectly" made some of his calculations. The memo also pushed back against views that Nvidia is too entangled in circular financial arrangements with some of its customers. "First, Nvidia's strategic investments represent a small share of Nvidia's revenue and an even smaller share of approximately $1T raised each year across global private capital markets," the memo said, adding, "The companies in Nvidia's strategic investment portfolio predominantly generate revenue from third-party customers, not from Nvidia." Burry called Nvidia's response "disappointing" and disclosed that he "continues to own puts" on Nvidia. While November undoubtedly turned up the heat on Nvidia, the chipmaker continues to be the world's most valuable company by market cap and its shares have slightly rebounded in recent days, closing up 1.37% on Wednesday. The world's largest tech companies rely on Nvidia's chips and have committed to spend billions and billions on the latest generation. CEO Jensen Huang has said sales of its latest Blackwell chips have been "off the charts." Nvidia's CFO, Colette Kress, told analysts earlier this month that the company is on track to bring in "half a trillion" in AI chip orders during the combined 2025-2026 period — a number that she said "will grow" as more deals are struck. While Nvidia's bruising back half of the month is a reminder that even AI royalty can see its crown threatened, Huang had some words for the doubters during the company's earnings call. "As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator," he said. "We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference." Jump to

Title: The new plan for Urban Planning Authorities, the Eurogroup on K.M.’s agenda with Weber, CVC sells marinas in a €1.5 billion deal, the Church and the auction
URL: https://en.protothema.gr/2025/11/27/the-new-plan-for-urban-planning-authorities-the-eurogroup-on-k-m-s-agenda-with-weber-cvc-sells-marinas-in-a-e1-5-billion-deal-the-church-and-the-auction/
Time Published: 2025-11-27T07:34:07Z

Hello, I find political news today less interesting than two other issues that are much more serious. The first concerns that tragic accident last Friday in Pagrati, in which an 84-year-old driver hit and killed a 75-year-old woman who was walking with her 30-year-old daughter with disabilities. When, finally, in this country will elderly people undergo serious tests in order to renew — or NOT renew — their driver’s license? It is time to put an end to an issue that literally kills innocent people. The second concerns the sudden work stoppage by STASY, due to a tragic accident that occurred in one of the company’s engine sheds in Piraeus. The work stoppage on the metro and tram paralyzed all of Athens yesterday afternoon and caused hardship to hundreds of thousands of citizens. The incident is tragic, but there is a prosecutor and an investigating judge looking into it and, if there is responsibility, it will be assigned through the Justice system. What is gained, and by whom, from making all of Athens suffer? Will working conditions change because of yesterday’s strike? Since the Thessaloniki International Fair, Stavros Papastavrou and Dimitris Papastergiou sat down to design how the reform announced by K.M. at the Fair will be implemented — specifically, the transfer of Urban Planning Offices from municipalities to the Cadastre. The plan has been prepared, will be presented today to the Cabinet, will begin to be implemented on a pilot basis in 2026, and fully by 2027. What it practically provides: integration of the Urban Planning Offices into the Cadastre Offices, both in substance and in the information system, and of course a reduction in physical contact points, through the digitalization of procedures. My understanding is that there will be one local Cadastre office per regional capital and one central office per region. Also, with the digital pool of cases, when one Urban Planning Office has a heavy workload, another with less can handle the work, without requiring contact with the engineer, the citizen, etc. Today at 20:00 K.M. has a scheduled dinner with the president of the EPP, Manfred Weber, who is in Athens with the candidate prime minister of the state of Baden-Württemberg, Manuel Hagel. Under other circumstances the dinner would be social in nature, but here it is obvious that K.M. wants to lobby on the issue of the Eurogroup and the prospect of the EPP supporting Pierre’s candidacy, who has just returned from Berlin. With K.M. at the central Athens restaurant will be Chatzidakis, who is also vice-president of the EPP, and ND’s Secretary for International Relations, Tasos Chatzivasileiou, who gets along well with the Germans. I asked my source who was describing the plan whether the matter of the Urban Planning Offices will stir up local reactions, as happened with the Hellenic Post. “Look, there are municipalities that react, but we do not want to put the mayors in opposition. There are also municipalities that don’t want to have anything to do with Urban Planning Offices,” he told me. As for the staff of the Urban Planning Offices, those who wish will be given the right to remain in the new structure, but if they do not want to, they will be absorbed into other services. I understand that perhaps even before year-end there may be an agreement between the government and industrialists on the issue of electricity and the subsidy that SEV is insistently demanding. After the issue of collective agreements, President Spyros Theodoropoulos has set course for an agreement and is in open communication with both K.M. and Chatzidakis. If I can make an estimate, the agreement will probably be somewhat less than what the industrialists wanted, but still—better than nothing… At the end of the week ND’s leadership will sit down to draft the plan for the party’s pre-congresses, which will pave the way for the party congress after Easter. There is information circulating that the start may be in Patras in the first ten days of December, but there is also the view that there is no point in doing anything before the holidays, as the party mechanism has already been mobilized one way or another due to internal elections. Therefore, the start may come in January, while the cities that will host the at least four pre-congresses will also be finalized. And we move on to market news with an interesting story about a fresh deal in the making. According to information, CVC is launching a process to sell D-Marin, the company that owns and manages marinas. It is a major deal, as the price is estimated to reach €1.5 billion. The Greek interest lies in the fact that included in the “package” coming to market are the marinas of Zea, Pylos, Lefkada, and the large marina in Gouvia, Corfu. According to the same sources, the sale process is taking place abroad. D-Marin owns 26 marinas in nine countries — Greece, Malta, Turkey, Croatia, Italy, France, Spain, Montenegro, and Albania. They sweated, but they are approaching the finish line. This concerns Masoutis and the acquisition of Kritikos, which barring surprises will be finalized by year-end. Initial estimates pointed to October, but it turned out not to be a walk in the park. The deal creates the third-largest player in the supermarket market in terms of turnover. Competitors argue that it will take time until the new entity is well organized and operates smoothly. Many shares of British gambling companies “went into the bucket” as the Labour government — making a dramatic effort to increase state revenue — decided to raise taxes on online gambling. The Remote Gaming Duty (RGD), imposed on online gambling, will rise to 40% in April 2026 from today’s 21%.Finance Minister Rachel Reeves aims to add over £1 billion annually to the state budget as a result of the new levies. However, the tax increase leads to a significant rise in costs for gambling companies, especially those offering online casino, betting, etc., with consequences for their suppliers and the entire sector’s chain. This may reduce profit margins, especially for smaller companies; some may be forced to downsize or restructure their activities through mergers or even leaving the market. Analysts believe there will be a drop in investment in the sector, as the increased tax burden makes the market less attractive.In this climate, the most affected shares were those of companies with high exposure to the British market. A characteristic example is Evoke (888, William Hill, etc.), which dropped 14%, while Entain (Ladbrokes, Coral, etc.) managed to absorb the pressure, and Flutter (Paddy Power, Betfair, FanDuel, etc.) closed in positive territory as it has significant presence in the U.S. Intralot, now controlled by Bally’s Interactive, was hit hard on the Athens Stock Exchange (-17%, at €0.92) due to its significant dependence on the UK market, since 60% of the new entity’s activities take place in the UK, where, among other things, it operates the highly popular online brand Monopoly Casino. Analysts consider the price of €80 million that OPAP will pay for the State Lotteries to be fair, if not advantageous. The company won the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP) tender for the 12-year concession of the exclusive management rights of the State Lotteries. It will pay a lump sum of €80 million, as well as 30% of gross profit annually, with a minimum guaranteed annual payment of €20 million. In April 2026, the current contract for the Lotteries held by Hellenic Lotteries expires, so OPAP managed to keep them in its portfolio until 2038. It is also noteworthy that OPAP will now have 100% of Hellenic Lotteries S.A., the company that has been running the State Lotteries to date, since Scientific Games is selling its 16.5% stake. Yesterday we also had the management’s conference call for the nine-month results, but no news emerged, and analysts and the market now await updates on the Allwyn–OPAP merger at the upcoming Capital Markets Update. The legal saga of Folli Follie continues, and at the latest hearing (November 25), objections were filed by the defendants — D. Koutsolioutsos, Aik. Koutsolioutsou and I. Begeitis — against the participation of shareholders supporting the accusation for fraud and forgery. Similar objections were filed against the participation of HCAP and EFKA. All objections will be decided at the next hearing. Regarding the FF request, the court announced it will give the floor only after its decision on the guilt or innocence of the defendants — that is, at the end of the trial. Despite the fact that this procedural order is provided by law and was followed at first instance, in practice, for cases such as this, it amounts to a form of “penalty” against the damaged party, who ends up being heard last, when everything has already been decided. The trial was again adjourned, to December 18, 2025. It is worth noting that the hearing at the Court of Appeal was originally set to begin on April 9, 2025, but since then it has been constantly postponed — from adjournment to suspension and back again. Time passes, the case drags on, and the administration of justice is tested by its own delays. Early this morning, at the five-star September City Resort Spa & Conference operated by Hotel Brain, in Pylaia, Thessaloniki, the entry of Telis Mystakidis into PAOK BC (KAE PAOK) is officially announced. The entrance into the new era begins with an “injection” of 5.5 million euros from the new major shareholder, while immediately afterwards a large share-capital increase will follow. To make all this happen, an extraordinary General Assembly of PAOK BC shareholders has already been convened for December 17, as required by the institutional framework, with the main item being the election of a new Board of Directors. This process constitutes the final formal step for the full and clean transition to the new ownership structure. It is well-known that the Church of Greece owns large real-estate holdings throughout the country. Now, however, these are the reason it appears on the lists of electronic auctions—albeit indirectly. To avoid misunderstanding: this is not a hammer due to debts, nor is it being hunted by servicers. As the column learns, it is found—formally—in the position of debtor, with a private individual as the party initiating the auction, because she and the Church are co-owners, each holding 50%, of a “prime” plot in Thessaloniki. In this auction, scheduled for 28 January 2026, in the position of “defendant–co-owner–party against whom the auction is directed,” appears the Legal Entity of Public Law under the name “Church of Greece,” headquartered on Iasiou Street in Athens. The entire procedure is based on a recent decision of the Multi-Member Court of First Instance of Thessaloniki, ordering the partition of the plot. It is a complete and buildable plot of 310 sq.m. in the municipality of Thessaloniki, on Polyxenis Antoniou Street, at the borders of the historic center and Ano Poli, near the Ministry of Macedonia–Thrace. Among the scenarios examined in the valuation report was its division, which was not advantageous, while the preferred solution proposed was either selling it as a whole or exploiting it by constructing a multi-story building and distributing the resulting horizontal properties. And so we arrived at the auction, which will take place with a starting price of €402,000. As for the ownership titles, they go as far back as a Royal Decree from 1952. In New York, Petros Pappas continues to be one of the few Greek constants closely monitored by the funds in the dry-bulk market. And it’s not only the financial results of the third quarter of 2025—net income $18.5 million, EBITDA $73.6 million, and an average daily charter rate of $16,634/day—that drew attention. Pappas’ philosophy continues to be read like a manual of financial discipline: the 19th consecutive dividend, steadily $0.11/share (with cumulative returns of $13.12/share since 2021), and above all, dedication to value creation through streamlining the share base. There aren’t many Greek shipowners talked about at trading desks for their buybacks, but Star Bulk has already “burned” about 5 million shares, investing $82.1 million, while another “wallet” of $91.4 million remains available. On Wall Street, this translates as follows: “Pappas knows what his stock is worth and buys when others hesitate.” It is the classic recipe of value operators who are not afraid of volatility, as long as the balance sheet can withstand it. At the same time, Pappas does not miss the chance to buy tonnage when prices are right. The three Kamsarmax newbuilding resales from a Chinese shipyard, delivering in Q3 2026, are read by analysts as a targeted bet on the fleet tightness ahead. The age fatigue of the global bulk fleet is now a given, while regulatory uncertainty—from U.S.–China fee measures to the postponed decision on the IMO Net Zero Framework—works more in favor of strong balance sheets than against them. The week in shipbuilding confirms a pattern that, on Wall Street, is now considered structural: Greek shipowners act as the most consistent source of demand for new tonnage in sectors with different cycles and risk profiles. In bulkers, Atlantic Bulk Carriers is methodically expanding its footprint with four new supramaxes in China—continuation of an order sequence reflecting confidence in future freight rates despite volatility. Pricing at $33.75 million per unit places the company in the “value buyers” zone, exploiting stable construction costs before new inflationary pressures appear. The moves by Danaos and Oceanbulk in container ships reveal a parallel reading of the market: feeder orders remain strong, as supply chains are being reconfigured and regional feedering gains importance. The fact that Danaos is closing a six-vessel 1,800-teu series at a yard specializing in LPG carriers shows the Chinese industry is seeking more flexible capacity use. Meanwhile, Oceanbulk’s two 3,100-teu ships indicate that Greek owners are operating in the “mid-size box” category, where the greatest supply–demand balance is expected after 2026. In the tanker market, VLCC orders have increased in intensity and frequency. Maran Tankers returns with four new vessels at Hanwha Ocean, while a parallel European order at HD Hyundai shipyards shows the crude-oil market is renewing a fleet that has aged faster than the historical average. Prices at $128–130 million indicate that shipyards have regained bargaining power and owners are pricing in resilient earnings over the next four years. The appearance of two LNG carriers in HD KSOE’s books is the exception proving the rule: the LNG market remains conservative with new orders. Workings and backstage movements at the headquarters of the International Maritime Organization, where Vassilis Kikilias represents the country ahead of the electoral process for Category A, in which Greece aims for first place. Given that the IMO is the maritime arm of the UN, what I can tell you is that in the days before the elections, interesting diplomatic games take place with votes and balances as bargaining chips. The Greek delegation has a clear goal: to remind partners of Greece’s role in international shipping—not as a given, but as a responsibility it wants to continue serving. In private meetings, the minister repeated the spirit of his speech: respect for procedures, commitment to cooperation, and a discreet but clear reminder that “Greeks are people of the sea.” The three-member delegation of the Single Resolution Board (SRB) in Athens, led by the well-dressed Czech gentleman and the exceptionally discreet Asian-origin lady, did not hide their enthusiasm after their meetings with the managements of Greek banks. SRB visits are never “courtesy calls” or filled with pleasantries. They arrive with a pre-prepared questionnaire seeking gaps in MREL capital adequacy, the ability for rapid asset transfers, and the readiness of IT systems to operate under emergency conditions. Particular attention this year was paid to the cross-border activities of Greek banks. It appears the inspection results were absolutely satisfactory—something they reportedly did not hide in their final assessment. Aegean’s market capitalization reached €1.3 billion, as it closely follows the trajectory of major European airlines hoping for an end to the war in Ukraine. The European aviation index Stoxx Europe Total Market Airlines recorded another rise yesterday (+1.91%) and on a weekly basis its gains exceeded +5.40%. The index is composed of shares of 10 airlines (Ryanair, IAG, Lufthansa, EasyJet, Air France–KLM, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Wizzair, Finnair, Enter Air, and Norse Atlantic), all of which always trade at valuations lower than justified by their figures, as the sector is extremely sensitive to climate or geopolitical shifts. Over the past week—since even faint echoes of peace have been heard—there has been significant capital inflow into the aviation sector, and Aegean is benefiting from this trend. On 19 November, Aegean’s share price was €13.14; yesterday we saw it at €14.60. In last Monday’s session, 158 thousand shares changed hands; on Tuesday the number nearly doubled to 257 thousand, and yesterday, Wednesday, exceeded 100 thousand shares. AEGEAN continues to stand out for its cash position, holding €379 million in net cash, while implementing an ambitious investment plan that will allow it to spread its wings even to India. High-level international delegations have recently been visiting Sunlight’s factory in Xanthi. Recently, a French delegation led by the French Consul General in Thessaloniki visited the facility, while a few weeks earlier, there had been a large visit of Defense Attachés from 23 countries across 5 continents. The close timing and nature of these two visits are not considered coincidental. France, as the second-largest market for industrial batteries in Europe, represents a strategic market for Sunlight, which simultaneously maintains a long-standing international presence in the market for energy solutions for defense applications. The Greek multinational group Sunlight is rapidly strengthening its role in the new international environment, where energy independence, security, and technological innovation are acquiring decisive importance. Excluding Intralot, which we mentioned above (-17.27% at €0.92) and its issues with the British budget, which dragged down all shares of the Kokkalis Group in its decline, yesterday’s session was a victory for balanced growth. The sixth consecutive upward session pushed the General Index above 2,100 points (2,106.9, +0.94%) with increased trading value of €311.55 million, including €70.6 million in pre-agreed block trades. Banks performed well and raised the pace, but the rise spread across almost all blue-chip stocks, with a clear protagonist being the DEI (Public Power Corporation) share (+2.29% at €7.19), for which investment firms are publishing a series of positive reports these days. Eurobank (+3.62% at €3.52) had many supporters yesterday, and trading in the stock approached €70 million (€49.6 million in blocks). National Bank (+3.38% at €13.06) and Piraeus (+2.31% at €7.19) also raised expectations high, while Alpha (+0.86% at €3.64) continues upward steadily without spikes. Notable is the performance of TITAN, which again reached the price of €45.6 (+1.22%). The mere publication of the news immediately knocked NVIDIA’s stock down by -6%. However, the consequences are broader. Zuckerberg’s Meta (Facebook) announced that it chose Google’s TPU chips instead of Nvidia’s GPUs. In doing so, it broke the monopoly that Nvidia had built in AI infrastructure. Nvidia immediately issued a press release expressing its “enthusiasm” for “Google’s success,” while simultaneously losing $250 billion in market capitalization. At the same time, it reminded that “we continue to supply Google,” since Google still depends on Nvidia’s H100 and GB200 chips for the most demanding AI tasks. Nvidia did not want to attack its best customer directly, despite its “infidelity.” For this reason, it made sure to remind the market that its own chips offer “greater performance and flexibility.” It aimed to warn every other hyperscaler and every company considering following Meta’s example. But for the rest of the market, the message is clear: Nvidia’s dominance is being challenged. Its stock lost 11% in ten days. Google’s TPUs are cheaper, may be limited in certain functions, but competition has knocked on the door of costly Nvidia, and this is just the beginning of another war at the heart of Artificial Intelligence. The submission of the 2026 Budget by the Labor government in the UK targets all those who have chosen London as a taxation base for their income. Savers and property income earners will face a straight tax increase of 2 percentage points on income from interest, rents, and dividends. This means that taxes on savings income start at 22%, rise to 42%, and reach 47%. Dividend tax rates rise to 10.75% for basic-rate taxpayers and go up to 35.75% at higher scales. Chancellor Reeves has budgeted an additional £500 million per year in tax revenues from savings and property income, and an additional £1.2 billion from dividends. For decades, the London market attracted income-focused investors precisely because of the large number of companies paying generous dividends every year. Clearly, these developments also concern Greeks who have purchased apartments in London to collect rent, as they now face a new headache. The tax increase comes in a context of rising inflation, high living costs, and increasing financial pressures. Explore related questions

During his thirty-eight year career he worked on six-continents in field and… More Info Vaalco Energy (NYSE:EGY) is small cap, Houston, Texas-based producer of oil and gas. Its original focus was offshore in the African country of Gabon, but a few years ago it diversified through a beneficial merger that expanded its global footprint. The company delivered a strong Q-4, 2023 earnings report that included news of its further diversification and entry into Côte d'Ivoire. The stock rallied to nearly $8.00 per share following the release of that report. A mixed report for Q-2 that year took the wind out of the company's sails, and thus began the long slide to the current $3.33 level. Now the Q-3 report is out, and there could be some reason for optimism for a rebound in the company’s shares, despite a miss on EPS and revenue. At a glance, the company trades at low multiples and is currently well below its 200 Day SMA of $3.90 per share. This bodes well for finding a favorable recommendation on EGY. In this article, we will dig into the particulars on EGY and come up with an investment recommendation for the stock. First we will take a quick look at the macro picture for oil. The crude oil macro The oversupply narrative is dominating trading in upstream equities. Crude oil has fallen about 30% thus far this year and may not have yet tested a bottom. Compounding current sluggishness is the war premium that had added back ~$10.00 to the price has leaked away as two of the three international hotbeds of belligerence-Israel/Gaza, and Ukraine/Russia, have shown signs of slowing to a simmer recently, a step down from outright hostilities. Peace, while a noble objective, is not good for business in oil and gas, as fears of a supply interruption keep traders long futures contracts in times of belligerence. When things calm down, the contracts are dumped on the market and must find a home, at a price. One spot worth keeping an eye on is Venezuela, as the U.S. turns the screws on the Maduro regime. A war in our hemisphere, so near the booming Guyanese ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Stabroeck project, could have profound consequences. Geopolitical volatility makes it important to pick your entry points carefully when investing in upstream oil and gas companies. There is good news on the horizon for those who take the plunge, however. Fortunately, demand remains strong and has decades to run if the new forecast from the International Energy Agency (IEA) is any guide. Fears of stranded barrels being written off on oil companies' balance sheets are less prevalent than a few years ago. The thesis for Vaalco Vaalco has been growing production since its merger with TransGlobe in 2022. This transformed the company from sole reliance on its Gabonese assets to a diversified player with a number of levers to pull globally. A move last year into Côte d'Ivoire was viewed favorably, and EGY just farmed into another offshore block in that country. In the short run, the company's focus has been on ramping up production in its Egyptian concession and Gabon. Results have been uneven with production progress and efficiency increases in Egypt, offset by a production turnaround and an FPSO refurbishment, combined with rig-related drilling delays in Gabon. This has pushed expected production from a new drilling campaign to the right, adversely impacting the stock. As the slide below notes, the shutdown and the near completion of the FPSO refurbishment, and then next the arrival of, Borr Drilling's Norve jack up is underway and should spud the first well sometime this month. Vaalco trades at a low EV/EBITDA multiple-2.8X, and a low flowing barrel valuation- $19K per barrel. Analysts here and on Wall Street rank the company as a strong buy. Price targets are $10.00 per share, but EPS estimates point to small losses over the next couple of quarters, which could delay any rally in the stock. The company has a quarter of its Q-4 production hedged at $ 60 and plans to increase this to about half. In 2026, EGY plans to hedge about 40% of its daily output. The company is returning capital to shareholders through a 6.5% dividend yield. The company has a small amount of LT debt and has been implementing a capital reduction and cost-cutting program that should improve cash flow and production. Catalysts for EGY An explorer's job is to find oil and gas. Full stop. Operating oil and gas assets is also enhanced by the adjacency of other assets. Sometimes this is called critical mass. It enables cost optimization through several avenues. Gaining operatorship over a block where seismic has already been shot for $3 million seems like a reasonably derisked proposition to me. Someone thought Block CI-705 offshore, Côte d'Ivoire, was prospective enough to shoot seismic, which isn't cheap, so it could be like the last person to pull the handle on a slot machine. Or it could lead to nothing. That's exploration. Dry holes are instructive as well. TotalEnergies, (NYSE: TTE) drilled a test in 2021, and DH'd it. Why did they drill it? Why does anyone think this area might be prospective? Well, if you go back 400 million years and put the puzzle pieces together to form Gondwana, you find the area now known as Côte d'Ivoire fits nicely adjacent to the areas known as Guyana and Suriname. That should cement it in your head as to what the Geo-types have in the back of their minds at EGY. This sort of thinking about the Atlantic Margin has led to the well-publicized discoveries in Guyana, Suriname, and Namibia. Snapshot of Atlantic basin (Google Maps) This is all down the road a piece, even in the success case. In the near term, we have the upcoming drilling campaigns in Gabon, Egypt, and the Baobab field in Côte d'Ivoire -EGY's legacy position from the TransGlobe merger. No catalyst discussion would be complete without at least a mention of EGY's 60% interest in Block P, offshore Equatorial Guinea. As of this date, a Plan of Development has been approved, and a Joint Operating Agreement is in place. Although Venus (Not to be confused with Total's Venus discovery offshore Namibia) As the slide below discusses, there is future prospectivity in this block. And the two producers and one injector needed to bring on Venus could be done in 2026. Canada is taking a backseat after several successes in the company's Cardium and Mannville plays in Alberta, with no further drilling planned until 2026. The slide below shows the 2.50-mile horizontal section performing nearly as well as the 3.0-mile type curve. Q-3, 2025 for EGY Most notably, the company hit the upper range of most production estimates, but cash flow suffered due to softness in Brent prices. Guidance for the full year expects 5% uplift YoY. Capex was reduced due to the issues with Gabon to optimize cash flow for the quarter. Even so, the company had to call upon its revolver for current expenses. Otherwise, the company has no debt. Company filings Risks to the thesis for EGY Even great deals can get cheaper. Picking an entry point can be frustrating as fundamentals continue to weaken. That's the era we are in right now. As I laid out in the Macro, there are many moving pieces driving oil prices, and most of them are not supportive. No matter how good the price of EGY stock looks relative to the recent past, it can always get cheaper when the market turns against upstream investors. Your takeaway EGY’s report reads pretty well. And EGY management is due some deference for their experience in West African operations, going back decades. Their balance sheet management also speaks well for the company. Borrowing money to support operations when interruptions in other projects present cash flow hiccups is no big deal. The company retains ample liquidity, assuming refurbishment with the FPSO goes according to plan. In my view, Vaalco's strong balance sheet, prospects for improving cash flow in the next year, and low multiples, put a buy target squarely on the company at its current level. The company is currently trading in a range well below its 50 and 200 day SMAs, which is probably more induced by the depressed pricing of Brent than anything else. I am giving EGY a Strong for investors with a high risk profile, seeking capital growth and competitive shareholder returns.
