Title: Bitcoin network activity drops to bear market levels – Red flag or buy signal?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-network-activity-drops-to-bear-market-levels-red-flag-or-buy-signal/
Time Published: 2025-05-08T00:00:28Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin’s low volatility and institutional support hint at potential growth despite bearish signals. Bitcoin [BTC] network activity has dropped to bear market levels since December 2024, as the Network Activity Index has sharply declined. This indicates a slowdown in transaction activity and a decrease in daily active addresses, signaling lower demand for block space. While this pattern is typical during bear markets or specific events like the China ban in 2021, it may not necessarily be a red flag. While the market may appear weak, the influx of institutional confidence may help stabilize BTC in the long term. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $96,998.87, reflecting a 2.91% increase over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin’s volatility has decreased to 25.80%, its lowest level in the past thirty days. This period of low volatility could suggest that the market is experiencing a temporary calm before any significant price movements. Historically, such periods of low volatility are often followed by sudden price shifts, whether upward or downward. Given the recent price increase, the market may be preparing for another volatile phase, especially with the upcoming FOMC meeting potentially influencing broader market sentiment. Source: IntoTheBlock At the time of writing, BTC was testing key resistance at $98K, with Fibonacci retracement levels indicating critical price action. The 0.236 and 0.382 retracement levels at $95,656 and $96,347 are key areas of interest, while the 50% and 61.8% levels at $94,799 and $92,171 provide potential support zones. The Stochastic RSI was at 41.55, signaling neutral conditions, with room for both upward and downward movement. A successful breakout above $98K would likely target the $100K mark, but failure to breach this level could lead to a pullback, making $90K and $92K the key support zones. Source: TradingView Bitcoin ETF inflows have been robust, with a total of $5.13 billion entering BTC ETF products over the last three weeks. These inflows signal strong institutional confidence in Bitcoin, even as retail activity slows. However, the upcoming FOMC meeting could introduce market volatility, as any adjustments in interest rates or commentary from the Federal Reserve could impact investor sentiment. Despite this uncertainty, the inflows into BTC ETFs suggest that institutional investors remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Source: Santiment Whale activity has surged recently, with institutional investors like BlackRock purchasing 280 BTC worth $37.8 million and Metaplanet adding 555 BTC. These purchases indicate that large holders are betting on Bitcoin’s future growth, and their actions could signal confidence in the asset, even amid uncertain market conditions. Despite bear market signals, BTC’s price action, along with institutional inflows and whale activity, suggests potential growth. With low volatility, major resistance at $98K, and institutional confidence rising, BTC may be gearing up for another upward move. However, the market’s direction will depend on BTC’s response to key price levels and the upcoming FOMC meeting, which could impact investor sentiment.

Title: The Art of the Price Hike

Trump’s tariff plan has pushed America’s businesses into a nightmarish experiment. This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. Maxwell Cohen knew the tariffs were coming. President Donald Trump had openly threatened a trade war on the campaign trail, and Cohen, an entrepreneur, heeded his words. His company, Peelaways, sells disposable and waterproof fitted bed sheets made in China that are popular with at-home and family caregivers. There’s only so much price elasticity for disposable goods, so he prepared to absorb what he estimated would be roughly 15 to 30 percent tariffs, setting aside money to bring in more inventory before prices skyrocketed. It would hurt, but it would be doable. He thought he had the numbers mostly worked out. But when man plans, Trump laughs. The latest figure for the administration’s tariffs on China sits at 145 percent. Prices are expected to keep climbing for some goods; last week, Trump closed the de minimis loophole for China and Hong Kong, which had exempted them from paying tariffs on shipments of goods worth $800 or less, and wide-ranging tariffs are still set to go into effect for many countries. For any business that can’t swallow an unanticipated and possibly huge price increase on imports, the first step is deciding if it will pass the cost to the consumer. If the answer is yes—as it often is—the next decision is how, or whether, to let the customers know. Tariff transparency recently made headlines on the domestic front of Trump’s trade war. After Punchbowl News reported that Amazon was considering adding a line showing the cost of tariffs for each product on its site, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt held a public shaming of the company from her briefing-room podium, calling the move “a hostile and political act.” CNN reported that a “pissed” Trump called Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder. The company’s representatives soon denied ever approving the idea, adding that it was never a consideration for Amazon’s main site but rather for its spin-off store, Haul. Although big, name-brand American companies are most likely to incur the administration’s wrath over displaying tariff surcharges, other businesses have tough choices to make on how to go about raising prices. The result is a choose-your-own-adventure exercise in managing public perception. Screenshots of the checkout page of the online clothing company Triangl went viral for the astronomical “duties” surcharge. Temu, a Chinese e-commerce giant, added import charges to certain products on its site. Luxury brands aren’t immune, either: Hermès announced price increases for American buyers to offset the tariffs, and Prada plans to raise prices by an undetermined amount later in the summer. Meanwhile, some business leaders aren’t mincing words. Jolie Skin Co, an American shower-filter brand, told The Information that a “Trump liberation tariff” line will be added to checkout pages. “Technically WE are not raising our prices,” the company’s CEO and founder, Ryan Babenzien, wrote on LinkedIn. “We think transparency is the way to go here and I am giving Trump full credit for his decision.” Transparency is a high-wire act. Tariffs is such a politically loaded word that some companies hesitate to invoke it, out of fear of alienating their customer base—or inciting the administration’s ire. But pointing a finger at tariffs can also help shift blame. Increasing prices without any clear explanation risks appearing opportunistic, Mike Michalowicz, a small-business expert, told me. All it takes is for some businesses to get caught profiteering before “the customer becomes suspect of not just them but of everybody.” The gaming industry is a prime example. Nintendo has a large manufacturing presence in China, and last month, it announced that the Switch 2 console would launch at the original price, but some of the accessories will cost more than previously expected. The company’s representatives attributed the update to “changes in market conditions.” If that phrase sounds familiar, it’s almost word for word the explanation Microsoft offered after announcing Xbox price hikes last week, which will run as high as $100 more for some models in America. The absence of the T-word is a glaring omission. Such muddy messaging may help insulate companies from the administration’s spite, but it invites backlash from customers who are quick to blame the good old-fashioned motive of corporate greed. If some companies fear appearing opportunistic, others are trying to cash in while they still can. Marketing 101 teaches you to distinguish your company from your competitors, and Business 101 says to move inventory before the economy goes kaput. What better way to do both than to slash prices when everybody else is raising them? “Pre-tariff” sales are cropping up at furniture companies, fashion retailers, and carmakers. Their underlying message: Get it before you can’t afford it. Ford’s latest campaign, “From America. For America,” is trying to strike an optimistic tone. As Audi pauses car imports to the United States, and automakers hem and haw over price changes, Ford has been running an ad since last month touting employee-priced vehicles and their company’s deep roots in American industry. It’s a strategic ploy—already, Ford has reported double-digit sales increases (although an analysis from CarEdge found that some of Ford’s more popular vehicles had better deals in March, before employee pricing went into effect). Other carmakers that manufacture models in America, including Mercedes and BMW, are promising to temporarily eat the cost of tariffs for some vehicles to keep prices from rising. But an expiration date for this generosity could be imminent: Last week, Ford’s CEO went on CNN and couldn’t say if prices would increase in the summertime. With so much left uncertain in Trump’s trade war, some small businesses are down to the wire. Many of them don’t have the cash to stockpile inventory or the storage space to keep it. The owners of the American vegan-cheese company Rebel Cheese have roughly a month to decide what to do. Much of their cheese relies on fair-trade cashews imported from Vietnam, which faces the threat of 46 percent tariffs, and their inventory is dwindling. The company already went through a round of layoffs a few weeks ago; at this point, adding at least a 10 percent price increase seems inevitable, Fred Zwar, one of the co-founders, told me. They are considering breaking down the numbers for customers when they announce the change, but the sharp fluctuations of Trump’s tariffs make the timing tricky: “We can’t do a price raise today and then say, Hey, they raised it another 90 percent. We need to do another price raise tomorrow,” Zwar said. All of this feels like déjà vu for Peelaways. Cohen dealt with Trump’s seesawing tariffs during his first term, which also coincided with COVID-19’s economic downturn. He laid off all six of his workers and restructured his business in order to stay afloat, leaving him with two C-suite executives overseas. This time around, he’s running a leaner operation and slowly raising prices $1 a week until he hits a 15 percent increase. His plan is to test different newsletters to measure his customer base’s feedback: One will include the standard fare (caregiver tips, customer reviews), and the other will acknowledge the tariffs’ effects on pricing. But even having gone through this before, Cohen can’t be sure he’ll make it out again. “We’re all just holding our breath,” he said, waiting for “whatever the next tweet brings.” Related: Here are three new stories from The Atlantic: Today’s News Evening Read The Real Motive Behind the Real ID–Deadline Charade By Juliette Kayyem Today’s deadline was largely artificial: According to the fine print of the regulations governing Real ID’s implementation, Homeland Security has until the end of 2027 to phase in the program in full. So the administration took today’s deadline to assure Americans that they could still fly, while it focused on another priority: immigration enforcement, rather than safety provision.

Search the news, stories & people Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN Topic:Child Care As troubled childcare provider Genius continues to battle financial woes, the future of its childcare centres remain in limbo. (ABC News: Lucas Hill) The future for staff and children at Genius childcare centres remains in doubt as the financially stricken company searches for new buyers. Administrators are still processing hundreds of enquiries from potential buyers, in an attempt to recoup huge debts owed. Genius remains embroiled in several legal battles over allegation over unpaid rent and wages. The fate of childcare centres looking after more than 1,100 children remains uncertain after administrators warned they may have to shut them down if they can't find a buyer. Centres run by the stricken Genius childcare empire are on the market after they were taken over by administrators, WLP Restructuring, in March following years of accusations by workers of wage underpayment and financial mismanagement. In an affidavit filed with the Federal Court last month, the administrators said they had already closed eight of 18 centres that two Genius companies operated when they collapsed, despite getting a $1 million cash injection from funder Finexia to keep trading. They warned they may have to close the remaining centres, leaving the children without daycare and tipping more than 200 workers out of their jobs, if they can't find a buyer. Centres may be forced to close, leaving hundreds of children without daycare. (ABC Kimberley: Ted O'Connor) Parent Kahri D'Este, whose two children are enrolled at a Genius centre in Conder in the ACT, said she is holding out hope that the centre stays open. "If it goes under — which I honestly think is highly likely — then we will have no care," she said. "We don't have any other option, it's not easy to get care here, everywhere has a waiting list for months." Ms D'Este said despite the ongoing threat of the centre suddenly shutting down, the "amazing staff" have kept her from walking away. "I cannot believe that the educators, who have stuck through it this whole way, could just be dropped like hot potatoes," she said. "There are so many good staff here, and they work their butts off, and they have been treated so badly." The administrators had intended to secure a new buyer by last week, but were still processing more than 400 enquiries from interested parties. The sale of the centres is intended to recoup the huge debts owed by companies in the Genius group, which currently stand at as much as $88 million and are forecast to grow as more creditors emerge. Potential buyers include Gold Coast-based Finexia, where Genius owner Darren Misquitta was until recently the biggest shareholder, but which has become embroiled in Genius's financial downfall. ASX-listed Finexia was forced to freeze its childcare fund in February and last month revealed to investors that more than a fifth of the fund's money was tied up in loans that were in default. Minutes from administrators' meetings with creditors reveal Finexia is chasing Genius over a loan worth more than $24 million, but Finexia has not formally informed investors of the dollar value of its loans to Genius. Finexia offers loans to childcare providers, and has provided funding to Genius. (Finexia) However, it has told the market of the sudden resignation of interim chief executive Marc Duncan last week, who had been at the helm since February when Executive Director and chief executive Patrick Bell left without warning after four years. The company is currently suspended from the exchange. Executive chairman Neil Sheather did not answer questions about Finexia's transactions with Genius. He told the ABC a company run by Mr Misquitta, Sprint Capital Partners, became Finexia's biggest shareholder in 2023 after a capital raising. Finexia's 2023 annual report shows Sprint owned 11.4 per cent of the company. But Mr Sheather said Sprint divested the holding after Finexia raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest. "What became clear to us at Finexia was that this was not the relationship we wanted," he said. Another potential buyer is Steps Early Learning, which has for months been poised to take over ten Genius centres. Steps, which is run by Mr Misquitta's former business partner Ashok Naveinthiran, had in April not yet received the critical provider approval required by ACECQA to be authorised to run childcare centres. Despite that, administrators said they had received more than $278,600 in childcare subsidies Steps had been paid since March. In the meantime, administrators are also investigating a string of transactions made by Genius companies' bank accounts, including transfers made in the days immediately before the administrators were appointed along with "payments to or at the direction of Mr Misquitta" and "payments to other third parties of at least $500,000". According to the affidavit, the results of those investigations will help determine whether Mr Misquitta contravened his director duties and allowed the companies to trade while insolvent. Genius Childcare owner Darren Misquitta remains at the centre of an investigation launched by administrators. (LinkedIn) Separately, an interim report by a different administrator responsible for a third Genius company known as Horizontal 1 Pty Ltd, said initial investigations suggested the company had not been able to pay its debts since as early as June 30, 2020. Genius is also embroiled in a legal stoush with global fund management giant Blackrock, with the company taking action in the Federal Court in November 2024 over more than $1.2 million in unpaid rent. The same month, the United Workers Union launched proceedings against Genius companies and Mr Misquitta claiming underpayment of superannuation and failure to pay wages to workers on time. That case has been temporarily paused pending the administration process. Mr Misquitta did not respond to the ABC's questions.

Shares in Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) are dipping sharply amid comments from tech giant Apple suggesting that artificial intelligence (AI) will threaten the dominance of the top search engine. Apple’s services chief Eddie Cue says he believes AI-run search engines will eventually replace the classic search engines like Google, Bloomberg reports. Speaking in a testimony during the US Justice Department’s lawsuit against Alphabet Inc, Cue said he expects Apple will use services from OpenAI, Perplexity and Anthropic as search options in Apple’s Safari browser in the future. “Prior to AI, my feeling around this was, none of the others were valid choices… I think today there is much greater potential because there are new entrants attacking the problem in a different way.” Currently, Google has been paying Apple as much as $20 billion a year to be the default search engine on Apple’s Safari browser. Following Cue’s testimony and the subsequent uncertainty of Google’s future dominance, the tech giant’s stock collapsed, wiping out over $200 billion in market cap. At time of writing, GOOG is down 10.4% on the day, currently trading at $149. Cue added that for AI search engines to improve, they will need better indexing, but even if they can’t achieve that, they will likely soon have features that are “so much better that people will switch.” Says Cue, referring to the switch from standard to AI-based search engines, “There’s enough money now, enough large players, that I don’t see how it doesn’t happen.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) shares slid Wednesday, a day after the cybersecurity company said in a regulatory filing it plans to cut roughly 500 jobs, or 5% of its workforce. CrowdStrike "continues to scale its business with focus and discipline" toward a target of $10 billion in ending annual recurring revenue (ARR), it said Tuesday. In March, the company reported ending ARR of $4.24 billion as of Jan. 31. CrowdStrike expects to incur between $36 million and $53 million in layoff-related charges, including $7 million in its fiscal 2026 first quarter, the filing said. The company plans to report current-quarter results on June 3, with those charges excluded from its adjusted figures. The company added it sees Q1 results "in-line with or above" its March guidance and affirmed its full-year outlook. In a letter to employees, CEO George Kurtz said CrowdStrike is at a "market and technology inflection point, with AI reshaping every industry." "AI flattens our hiring curve, and helps us innovate from idea to product faster," Kurtz added. "It streamlines go-to-market, improves customer outcomes, and drives efficiencies across both the front and back office." Shares of CrowdStrike fell 5% in recent trading but are up 23% in 2025.

Title: Mark Carney’s Sustainability Goals Could Reshape Canadian Real Estate
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/alihoss/2025/05/07/mark-carneys-sustainability-goals-could-reshape-canadian-real-estate/

ByAli Hoss ByAli Hoss, Contributor. Could Carney's Climate Strategies Provide Competitive advantages in Canada's commercial Real Estate? Canada stands at a pivotal juncture in its sustainability journey, marked by the recent emergence of Prime Minister Mark Carney. As the nation transitions from traditional carbon taxation to a nuanced incentive-based climate strategy, commercial real estate stakeholders must carefully consider the implications of these substantial policy shifts. Carney’s ambitious plans present both considerable opportunities and complex challenges for the Canadian commercial property sector. This transition is further accentuated by evolving sustainability standards across Canada, driven by the urgent imperative to reposition soon-to-be stranded assets. Stakeholders must thoughtfully navigate these interconnected dynamics, capitalizing on emerging incentives and adapting proactively to maintain competitiveness and resilience. Canada’s evolving sustainability strategy under Carney’s leadership will undoubtedly impact the commercial real estate sector. It looks like 2025 marks the beginning of a new regulatory landscape. Historically, Canada’s approach to climate change mitigation and adaptation centered heavily on a consumer-facing carbon tax, designed to incentivize sustainable choices through direct financial costs. However, Carney’s administration has significantly shifted this approach, eliminating consumer carbon pricing in favor of targeted incentives and enhanced industrial regulation. Carney’s strategy retains carbon pricing mechanisms for large industrial emitters, thus continuing to leverage regulatory pressures effectively within heavy industries. Canada’s new policy notably emphasizes the importance of maintaining the nation’s global competitiveness through the introduction of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. This tariff not only discourages companies from relocating to countries with weaker climate regulations, but also equalizes costs associated with carbon-intensive production. This allows businesses in countries committed to ambitious climate targets to remain competitive internationally. For commercial real estate owners and operators, this raises intriguing questions: How might these industrial regulations indirectly influence property investment markets, particularly in regions heavily dependent on manufacturing, logistics, or resource extraction? Could CBAM indirectly alter property values or tenant demand patterns, compelling developers and investors to reassess site location, procurement strategies, and performance benchmarks? The results remain to be seen. Carney’s climate initiatives are also focused on incentives for the adoption of sustainable technologies, including a 31% credit rate for eligible properties acquired after January 1, 2024. The additional expansion of subsidies for electric vehicles, heat pumps, efficiency retrofits, and renewable energy installations promises to accelerate Canada’s transition to a low-carbon economy. These subsidies offer the commercial real estate sector tangible financial incentives to integrate cutting-edge sustainability technologies into building design and operations. Furthermore, direct government support, such as Canada Infrastructure Bank’s Building Retrofits Initiative, will likely create favorable conditions for developers investing in sustainable construction and retrofits. Carney’s administration has explicitly committed to accelerating project approvals, such as a $175 million investment in the Hudson Bay Railway and the Port of Churchill, especially projects related to critical minerals and clean-energy infrastructure. We should also take into account the Building Emission Performance Standards, which set explicit emissions performance benchmarks for commercial buildings, incentivizing efficiency upgrades, renewable energy integration, and electrification. However, BEPS implementation poses challenges as well, especially regarding upfront retrofit costs. Cities like Vancouver address affordability concerns through targeted financial incentives and technical assistance programs, ensuring equitable compliance pathways for diverse stakeholders. Although solutions will vary across provinces, the nation-wide policy direction raises questions about whether proactive engagement in sustainability initiatives will led to competitive advantages in tenant attraction, operational cost management, or long-term asset valuation. The nonprofit Green Communities Canada released a report in April 2025 projecting that eco-friendly retrofits could save Canadians $3.8 billion over the next 20 years for at least half a million Canadian households. Perhaps most significantly, Carney’s advocacy for mandatory emissions disclosures, including Scope 3 emissions, and for structured frameworks guiding financial institutions toward sustainable investments, is expected to have widespread across the Canadian economy. His renowned maxim, "What gets measured gets managed," encapsulates his belief in data-driven transparency as a catalyst for environmental action. Real estate finance, inherently reliant on institutional lending and capital markets, stands to experience substantial shifts under these new financial sector guidelines. Mandatory climate risk disclosures could alter investment attractiveness, reshape lending practices, and influence asset valuation methodologies. Regulatory frameworks like Vancouver’s Climate Emergency Action Plan impose stringent emissions caps, substantial fines, and progressive tightening of standards. Buildings failing these benchmarks face diminished financing options, lower valuations, and decreased tenant appeal. In this regulatory landscape, institutional investors increasingly prioritize sustainability performance metrics, suggesting an evolving landscape where properties demonstrating superior environmental credentials will likely command valuation and rent premiums. Moreover, financial institutions and investors increasingly categorize assets failing sustainability standards as high-risk investments. Given the significant economic disruptions accompanying recent tariffs and international trade tensions, substantial stimulus investment in sustainable infrastructure, including commercial real estate, could deliver multifaceted economic benefits. For example, directing governmental funding toward sustainable commercial developments in urban cores might simultaneously stimulate economic recovery and address critical urban housing shortages through mixed-use projects. On the other hand, while Carney’s vision presents substantial opportunities, it also introduces complexities and potential risks. Carney’s historical emphasis on voluntary industry collaboration, such as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero and Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, underscores a preference for cooperative rather than strictly regulatory frameworks. However, voluntary approaches alone might be insufficient, as their effectiveness can be undermined by subjective interpretations with a high risk of greenwashing. For instance, in recent months, four of Canada’s largest banks have withdrawn from the United Nations-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance, an initiative specifically designed to accelerate climate action within the financial sector. This trend is mirrored in the U.S., where several major banks and leading asset management firms, such as BlackRock and Vanguard, also stepped away from prominent climate-focused asset manager alliances. These departures highlight the fragility of voluntary climate commitments and reinforce the need for robust, binding policies to promote transparency and accountability. Looking ahead, the shift from consumer carbon taxation toward structured incentives, financial market reforms, and integrated societal solutions positions real estate as a critical player in Canada’s sustainability journey. Carney’s proposed framework underscores the intricate balance between environmental stewardship, economic pragmatism, and social responsibility. For the commercial real estate industry, navigating this new paradigm will require strategic foresight, proactive adaptation, and collaborative engagement with both public and private stakeholders. As Canada embarks upon this ambitious sustainability trajectory, commercial real estate professionals must thoughtfully consider their roles, responsibilities, and opportunities. By proactively integrating sustainability into strategic decision-making the industry can not only thrive economically but also significantly contribute to Canada's sustainable future. This could be achieved through leveraging emerging incentives, adapting to regulatory complexities, embracing technology, and aligning with broader societal goal. Ultimately, the effectiveness of Carney’s vision will depend on its successful translation into actionable policies, transparent governance, and genuine stakeholder collaboration. For Canadian commercial real estate, this represents an unprecedented opportunity to lead by example, demonstrating how visionary climate policy can underpin enduring economic resilience and environmental sustainability.

For instance, in recent months, four of Canada’s largest banks have withdrawn from the United Nations-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance, an initiative specifically designed to accelerate climate action within the financial sector. This trend is mirrored in the U.S., where several major banks and leading asset management firms, such as BlackRock and Vanguard, also stepped away from prominent climate-focused asset manager alliances. These departures highlight the fragility of voluntary climate commitments and reinforce the need for robust, binding policies to promote transparency and accountability. Looking ahead, the shift from consumer carbon taxation toward structured incentives, financial market reforms, and integrated societal solutions positions real estate as a critical player in Canada’s sustainability journey. Carney’s proposed framework underscores the intricate balance between environmental stewardship, economic pragmatism, and social responsibility. For the commercial real estate industry, navigating this new paradigm will require strategic foresight, proactive adaptation, and collaborative engagement with both public and private stakeholders. As Canada embarks upon this ambitious sustainability trajectory, commercial real estate professionals must thoughtfully consider their roles, responsibilities, and opportunities. By proactively integrating sustainability into strategic decision-making the industry can not only thrive economically but also significantly contribute to Canada's sustainable future. This could be achieved through leveraging emerging incentives, adapting to regulatory complexities, embracing technology, and aligning with broader societal goal. Ultimately, the effectiveness of Carney’s vision will depend on its successful translation into actionable policies, transparent governance, and genuine stakeholder collaboration. For Canadian commercial real estate, this represents an unprecedented opportunity to lead by example, demonstrating how visionary climate policy can underpin enduring economic resilience and environmental sustainability.

Title: BlackRock Buys $2,500,000,000 Worth of Bitcoin As BTC Price Holds Steady: Arkham

New data from market intelligence firm Arkham reveals that asset management titan BlackRock purchased billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin (BTC) as the flagship crypto asset closes in on $100,000. In a new thread on the social media platform X, Arkham says that BlackRock, which has over $11 trillion in assets under management, bought $2.5 billion worth of BTC last week. In his annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggests Bitcoin may one day become the world’s reserve currency, replacing the US dollar. Says Fink, “The US has benefited from the dollar serving as the world’s reserve currency for decades. But that’s not guaranteed to last forever. The national debt has grown at three times the pace of GDP since Times Square’s debt clock started ticking in 1989. This year, interest payments will surpass $952 billion – exceeding defense spending. By 2030, mandatory government spending and debt service will consume all federal revenue, creating a permanent deficit. If the US doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Meanwhile, Arkham notes that the publicly traded Bitcoin mining firm Riot Platforms is selling hundreds of BTC. “Riot just reported that they sold 475 BTC in April for $38.8 million. During April, they moved exactly 475 BTC to NYDIG. [Monday], they just moved another $6.7 million BTC to NYDIG. Are they selling even more this month?” Arkham data shows that the company’s portfolio now includes about 6,611 BTC, worth about $642 million at current prices. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $97,238.

Title: Saylor Pressures Microsoft To Join Bitcoin Revolution With $75 Billion Bet
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/saylor-microsoft-bitcoin-75-billion-bet/
Time Published: 2025-05-07T14:30:05Z
Full Content:
At the Bitcoin for Corporations 2025, MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor turned his keynote into a direct challenge for one of the technology sector’s most cash-rich giants. Speaking to an audience of chief financial officers and treasury executives, he argued that Microsoft should shift tens of billions of dollars from share buybacks and short-dated Treasuries into Bitcoin, calling the cryptocurrency “the universal, perpetual, profitable merger partner” that outclasses every other treasury asset in the artificial-intelligence age. Saylor framed the comparison starkly. “Microsoft is up 18% a year for the past five years. Bitcoin is up 62%,” he said, adding that the S&P 500’s compound growth rate of roughly 14% defines the hurdle rate by which corporate capital allocation is judged. “Normalize everything against that cost of capital and you discover Microsoft’s real out-performance is 4%. Bitcoin’s is 48%. Bonds are negative. Why would you hold the thing that’s destroying capital when the apex asset is compounding almost 50% above the cost of money?” He then zeroed in on Microsoft’s current balance sheet mix. “If Microsoft buys bonds, you’re destroying 99.7% of your capital over ten years,” he declared. “Buying your own stock is only marginally less catastrophic—you’re vaporizing 97%. Buying Bitcoin would be ten times better than buying back MSFT.” Saylor’s argument rests on his conviction that Bitcoin inaugurates a third monetary epoch. “Gold was nineteenth-century money; sovereign debt was twentieth-century money. Bitcoin is twenty-first-century money—the first liquid, fungible capital asset with no counterparty,” he said. He dates the institutional “year zero” for Bitcoin to 2024, “the moment the SEC blessed spot ETFs and FASB signaled fair-value accounting.” By that chronology, 2025 is “year one” and the window for first-mover advantage is already narrowing. To quantify the upside, Saylor revealed that his team ran Microsoft through the open-source “Bitcoin 24” treasury-modeling tool. Four scenarios were stress-tested: sweeping excess cash into Bitcoin, substituting dividends for coin purchases, replacing buybacks with accumulation, and adding a thin layer of leverage. “Depending on the mix, it adds anywhere from $155 to $584 a share—one to five trillion dollars in enterprise value—while taking less risk,” he said. “I’m asking you to stop surrendering the capital you just spent five years winning.” The emotionally charged moments of the keynote came when Saylor linked treasury policy to operational strain. “When you divest yourself of $200 billion, you amplify every risk factor in your own prospectus,” he warned. “You put massive pressure on your employees, then on your customers—lock them into three-year contracts, force them to buy everything when they only want some things—then your competitors complain and the regulators sue you. All of it because you’re chasing quarterly volatility you could hedge instantly by holding a non-correlated hard asset.” He pressed the point with a thought experiment aimed squarely at Microsoft’s board. “If you could buy a hundred-billion-dollar company growing 60% a year at one-times revenue, would you do it? What if you could do it every year, forever?” he asked. “That’s Bitcoin. The irony is that the least risky acquisition imaginable is perceived as risky by consensus finance.” 🇺🇸 MICHAEL SAYLOR JUST CALLED MICROSOFT TO BUY $75 BILLION OF #BITCOIN AND MAKE $4 TRILLION IT’S COMING!!! 🚀 pic.twitter.com/ujyHwquA0e — Vivek⚡️ (@Vivek4real_) May 6, 2025 Saylor reserved his longest uninterrupted passage for a final appeal: “Rich people are not rich because of a future expectation of cash flows; they’re rich because they own hard assets. I would rather be invested in a rich company than in a company that gives away its money and promises to work ever harder and raise prices on customers ad infinitum.” He added: “You can cling to twentieth-century capital—treasury bills, stock buybacks, dividends—or you can embrace the future, capitalize on Bitcoin, and turn a decapitalization spiral into progressive growth. It’s good for your customers, your employees, your shareholders, your country, and your legacy. Adopt Bitcoin.” The shorthand $75 billion bet circulating in conference corridors reflects Microsoft’s authorized buyback and two years of forward dividends folded into a single digital-asset allocation. Notably, Microsoft shareholders voted against a proposal to add Bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet during the firm’s meeting on December 10. At press time, BTC traded at $96,521.

Title: 50 Companies Now Hiring Remote Jobs In 2025

ByRachel Wells ByRachel Wells, Contributor. Companies in tech, health, and defense industries have the greatest share of remote jobs Once upon a time, getting a good, stable job meant relocating into a big city, traveling into the office and skipping your son's baseball game while stuck for hours in never-ending traffic or the rush of the commute. Today, the workplace is being redefined. Remote work and hybrid models are popular amongst jobseekers and professionals eager to advance in their careers, and employers are embracing the challenge. Although many employers still prefer their workers to be in the office more than working from home, there's still a sizable number of companies still hiring for fully remote roles and hybrid roles too, so you can get the best of both worlds. You're able to progress your career at these companies just as well as if you were working at the office. And, at the same time, you won't have the guilt of missing out on your children's school activities or any aspect of your personal and family life. Plus, you'll even have time to work on a side hustle when you're working from home. Just a few weeks ago, FlexJobs, a popular remote and flexible work job board, analyzed the remote job listings within their database from January to March 2025. Their findings revealed that companies with the greatest share of remote job listings across that time period regularly reviewing reports like these enables you to keep a finger on the pulse of remote work trends and helps you make informed decisions as a job seeker so you can narrow down your employer choices and be more targeted with your job search. Here’s the full list: The main industries represented by these employers include healthcare (covering service providers and health insurance companies), financial services, investments and banking, IT, and defense and engineering. As a job seeker or professional passively looking for remote career opportunities, there are tons of ways to find remote work other than the traditional methods that everyone else uses, like scrolling through job boards. In fact, browsing Indeed and LinkedIn Jobs hoping for remote work opportunities is severely limiting you because there are so many other opportunities that you’re missing due to relying on stale methods. You need to remember that there is such a thing as the hidden job market, explained in detail here. In a nutshell, this means that most jobs never actually quite make it to a job board. Many are hidden within a company and you'll only find out about them through connecting with the right people and building your network strategically. Aligning yourself with decision-makers and building relationships with them will enable you to be put forward for referrals, making it easier for you to secure a job than hopelessly waiting to be progressed to the next stage after sending out hundreds of applications on Indeed. Here are some ways to find remote jobs that you probably haven’t considered: Freelancing allows you to work from anywhere on your own terms, and you could land a project as early as this week, so this is probably the fastest way to secure a contract or “job” while working from home. Applying directly on a company’s career page always beats applying for the same role via a posting on a job board. Go straight to the source as much as possible. Try: Lastly, try unconventional methods such as: If you’re feeling a little overwhelmed with this list, start your remote job search strategy by picking at least five companies from the “companies hiring” list above, researching them, tailoring your application materials, and then applying at least three of the strategies listed above to help you find more remote jobs or to connect you to the right people within these companies who would be hiring. Applying directly for remote jobs by finding outside-the-box approaches to contact hiring managers ... More allows you to secure remote work faster Try this approach each week, and you’ll find yourself hired faster than 90% of other job seekers…all because you decided to take an innovative, outside-the-box approach. You’re shifting your mindset beyond merely applying for jobs, and now you’re pitching yourself like a business, to partner with other companies to solve their problems. This adjustment is what will really make you stand out when looking for remote work.

Title: Irish Times readers on the Catholic Church: ‘I am very proud to be a Roman Catholic in Ireland today’

The conclave to choose the next head of the Catholic Church has begun, following the death of Pope Francis in April. While the world waits to hear who will be named the next pope, we asked our readers to submit their views on the Catholic Church. Bill Fox (66), a retired clinical psychologist from Co Sligo, says he is “very proud to be a Roman Catholic in Ireland today”. “I have always practised my faith, apart from lapsing for a few months while I was a student. “I have been a Minister of the Word for about 30 years and a Minister of the Eucharist for about 23 years ... My religious faith has become more important to me in later life.” He says he attends Mass on a weekly basis and prays “every day”. Liam Bairéad (74), from Dublin, experienced a lapse in faith in his 20s but now describes his “sense of God at the centre of everything good” as “very strong”. A retired secondary schoolteacher, he was “raised in a strongly Catholic household”. “By the age of 20 I had turned my back on the Catholic Church and religion in general. I lost all faith in God and became, very consciously, a materialist and an atheist. [ Have Your Say: What is your view on the Catholic Church?Opens in new window ] “Then a series of incidents and encounters and my reflections on them caused me to become a lapsed atheist by the time I was 25. I returned to the practice of the Catholic faith, particularly the Mass and the Eucharist,” he says. Michael O’Flanagan (33), from Dublin, believes “the papacy of Pope Francis has opened the doors for a more welcoming and inclusive church”. “As a young person in my early 30s the papacy of Pope Francis brought me closer to the institutional church, but the humility of Pope Francis brought the institutional church closer to God,” he says. Concern regarding the continued involvement of religious orders in the Irish education system was one issue that recurred in responses. Anna McCabe (91), from Longford, says she “joined Atheist Ireland and later the Humanist Association of Ireland” after her belief in Catholic teachings faded. “I no longer believed what they taught me as a child and what I taught to primary schoolchildren for many years ... I consider teaching religion to young children as a form of child abuse. I think religion should be taught outside school.” Mike Gogan (62), a copy writer from Dublin, also chose to distance himself from the Catholic Church “as a young man in 1986”, saying he has “not looked back” since. “At the time my mother questioned my actions, but as soon as the reports of abuse started to emerge, she understood. I have not looked back and have been actively involved in trying to remove the influence of the church in our education system.” Some felt they could talk more freely without being fully identified, such as Aidan from Dublin, who said: “[I was] baptised by my parents as a Catholic and educated at Willow Park and Blackrock ... I had lost faith long before my fellow students revealed the horrific abuse at the hands of priests, but it really added to my anger thinking of the two-faced piety and sanctimony of pulpit paedophiles being enabled by the Catholic Church omertà which prevailed for so long in Ireland.” While he no longer practices nor believes “in a man-made religion”, he “still somewhat regret[s] not having a faith of any kind”, adding that “it must be a comfort to those who do”. Having grown up in south Dublin and now living in Switzerland, Seán Redmond (54) says he “wish[es] that the Catholic church was less Catholic and more Christian”. “Since I was a child, I have seen the Catholic hierarchy on one side of the current culture war we are in and the priests on another,” says Mr Redmond, describing himself as “more aligned with the poor priests than with the hierarchy”. I felt cushioned in a blanket of prayers ... The unchanging tenets of my faith are an anchor in these uncertain times “Why can’t women be priests? Why can’t priests have children? What is wrong with being LGBTQ? Is the command to love one another as I have loved you too complicated in a patriarchal society? Why must the majority cardinals and bishops be over 70?” he asks. Paul (67), who works in the education sector in Dublin, says despite coming “from a devout Catholic family” his own faith waned and by his early teens he had “ceased to believe the bulk of Catholic teaching”. “Growing older, I began to witness so much of what I found repulsive about Catholicism,” he says, listing “the wealth of the Vatican and the grandiose pomp and ceremony that accompanies it ... the misogyny and obsession with sexuality ... and then of course, the revelations of the breadth and depravity of physical and sexual abuse perpetrated by so many ordained members of the church” among examples. For others, like retired secondary schoolteacher Breid Carberry (68) from Co Donegal, Catholicism has offered solace during difficult periods. “I have had a lot of illness in my life and my Catholic faith sustains and comforts me in good times and bad,” says Carberry, reflecting on her diagnosis of breast cancer. “I felt cushioned in a blanket of prayers ... The unchanging tenets of my faith are an anchor in these uncertain times.” [ New pope will face a Vatican budget crisis and myriad other problemsOpens in new window ] Siobhán Cullen (61), from Kildare says her religious upbringing informed her current relationship with Catholicism. “I go to Mass on Sunday and my faith is important to me. My parents were very religious, as were most parents of the 1960s, and they passed on that faith to me and my siblings. I left the church for a while in my late teens, but came back to it in my mid-20s and it has been a great source of comfort and joy to me. “I realise that this has not been the case for a lot of people and can understand how this has turned them against the church. It was truly horrendous what went on and the church should pay recompense to those victims. I have been lucky in that the priests and nuns I met were good people and did great work for the community.” Ursula (57), a self-described “cradle-Catholic”, also from Kildare, attends Mass daily. “Through faith and the 10 commandments, I don’t agree with a lot of societal change,” she says, citing abortion as an example, “but we all have free will and I can’t judge anyone. “My prayer is always ‘let not their sin become mine’. In other words, if I judge others, I am creating a greater sin. This life is where we choose to follow Jesus or not.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

DON'T GET LEFT OUT: HUNTER MUST BE STOPPED! by Michael Snyder | May 7, 2025 | Conspiracy Fact and Theory | 2 comments This article was originally published by Michael Snyder at The Economic Collapse Blog. Are you ready for store shelves to start emptying all over America? When I first started writing about the coming shortages last month, I received quite a bit of criticism. But now, expert after expert is warning that we really are facing a crisis of historic proportions. Most major retailers still have several weeks of inventory on hand, but after that, shortages are going to start becoming very visible. For smaller businesses, the shortages will be noticeable a lot sooner. On Sunday, I visited a local small business to purchase some groceries. In addition to selling groceries, this particular discount store also sells a wide variety of other products, and some of them are made in China. As I walked through the aisles, I was stunned by how low their stock levels were. Honestly, it was kind of depressing. Of course, anything that we are witnessing now is just the leading edge of what is eventually coming. According to CNN, it is estimated that “Chinese imports into the United States will plunge by as much as 80% by the second half of the year”… The historically high tariff on China has effectively stopped all trade between the two countries, Trump has said repeatedly. The number of cargo ships headed from China to the United States fell 60% in April, according to Flexport, a logistics and freight forwarding broker. JPMorgan estimates Chinese imports into the United States will plunge by as much as 80% by the second half of the year. American consumers should expect pandemic-like disruptions as goods that were warehoused before tariffs took effect begin to run out over the next week or so, including higher prices, shortages and empty store shelves. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said repeatedly that the high tariff on China are “unsustainable,” and Trump also said he expects the tariff to come down. But it would need to come down significantly – by more than half – for any real trade to recommence, trade experts say. But even then, the economic damage would be done — and it would be weeks or even months before American shelves would be replenished. This is going to be catastrophic. Anyone who cannot see this simply does not understand how our system works. Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen is a supply chain expert that helps thousands of businesses move products around the globe, and he is warning that we are facing “an extinction-level, asteroid-wiping-out-the-dinosaurs kind of event”… “If they don’t change the tariffs, it’s going to be an extinction-level, asteroid-wiping-out-the-dinosaurs kind of event,” he told me. “Only these aren’t dinosaurs. These are dynamic, healthy businesses.” He knows this because those businesses are his customers. They use Flexport to transport products from the factory to your front door. Petersen’s company handles everything from booking space on planes, trucks and enormous ocean carriers to managing all the tedious paperwork along the way. Ryan Petersen knows exactly what he is talking about, because dealing with supply chains is what he does for a living. According to Petersen, container bookings from China to the United States have already fallen by 60 percent… But since the tariffs took effect, ocean-freight bookings from China to the U.S. have dropped 60%, Petersen says. In response, containership operators are shrinking their boats and canceling trips altogether. It takes a while for downstream consequences to flow through the system—but logistics nerds can look at the data on their screens and see into the future. If tariffs continue at this rate, Petersen says, it’s only a matter of time before that asteroid hits. There are thousands upon thousands of products that are made in China that aren’t made anywhere else. And it takes years to build new factories and set up new supply chains. So how are we possibly going to replace the 438 billion dollars of imports from China that normally fill up our store shelves? Of course the truth is that we aren’t going to replace those imports and store shelves will soon start getting emptier and emptier. In addition, it is likely that we will see massive layoffs as supply chains all over the U.S. slow down dramatically. Southern California is one area that will get hit particularly hard… With more than 70% of the port workforce living within a 10-mile radius of the complex, LA’s waterfront communities of San Pedro, Wilmington and Long Beach are expected to be the first hit by the slowdown, but they will certainly not be the last, said Gary Herrera, president of International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) local 13. “One in every five jobs in southern California is tied to the ports – warehouse workers, truck drivers, logistic teams and more,” said Herrera, who has been a longshore worker since 1998. Herrera says LA’s Inland Empire, including Riverside and San Bernardino, which serve as warehousing centers for retailers such as Walmart and Amazon, as well as communities such as Bakersfield and Barstow, which have freight rail lines, will also be severely affected. Even if President Trump made a deal with China this week, we are being told that it could take up to a year for our supply chains to fully return to normal… “These are big, massive bullwhips that have not been seen since COVID,” Evan Smith, the CEO of the supply-chain-management company Altana Technologies, told me. “The tariffs themselves are a shock to the system, and the shock is echoed and amplified across the entire chain. Even if there is resolution, it will take nine to 12 months to work out these bumps.” The good news is that it appears that the Chinese are open to beginning negotiations with the Trump administration. But the Chinese are insisting that they will not be coerced into making a deal. There had been hope that tariffs on Chinese goods would be reduced in an attempt to get China to the negotiating table, but President Trump has slammed the door on that possibility… When Welker directly asked, “You’re not dropping the tariffs against China to get them to the negotiating table?” Trump’s response was unequivocal: “No.” His firm stance underscores a broader strategy of using tariffs as leverage to protect American economic interests and curb China’s global influence. Even if negotiations commenced tomorrow, we would probably not see a deal with China until months from now. Meanwhile, our supply chain crisis will continue to get worse with each passing day. If there is anything that is made in China that you are going to need, I would get it immediately. It does not appear that President Trump plans to reverse course on his tariffs anytime soon. In fact, he just unveiled a new 25 percent tariff rate on most foreign-made auto parts… President Trump’s tariffs on foreign-made auto parts began on May 3, with automakers receiving some concessions from the administration but still feeling the heat on others. Trump signed an executive order formalizing the new rules late last week, which gave some carve-outs to what would have been blanket 25% tariffs on imported auto parts. Everything from foreign-made powertrain components to seats and airbags is affected. This is not a drill. A global trade war is here, and it is going to cause immense pain all over the planet. It won’t be too long before empty shelves start appearing all over America. So if there is something that you need to get done, get it done now.

Title: Why The Future For Financial Advisors Is In The Private Market

ByAtish Davda ByAtish Davda, Forbes Councils Member. Atish Davda is EquityZen's CEO, former quant at AQR Capital and a Penn alum who loves FinTech, Python, traveling and tennis. The secret is out about private markets. BlackRock’s recent announcement that its model portfolios will now incorporate private market investments marks a pivotal shift in the investment landscape. This move may make a significant impact in democratizing access to private assets—something to which I’ve dedicated my career. Big market moves like this also challenge the status quo. If BlackRock’s model portfolios make private market investments the norm, financial advisors may need to rethink their strategies to remain competitive. The global economy is currently facing substantial headwinds. President Trump’s tariff announcements have injected uncertainty into the markets, with fears of a potential recession looming. These protectionist measures have led to increased market volatility, prompting investors to seek alternative avenues for diversification and stability. The market landscape makes BlackRock’s strategic shift toward private markets all the more timely. By blending private and publicly traded assets, BlackRock aims to provide investors with more diversified and resilient investment portfolios. This move reflects a broader industry trend toward incorporating alternative assets to dampen the effects of volatility, while capturing the illiquidity premium and providing the potential for better risk-adjusted returns. All market evolutions—from the launch of ETFs to SPACs—present both opportunities and challenges for financial advisors. Now that individual investors can more easily gain diversified exposure to alternatives while paying much lower fees than an advisor may charge, advisors will be challenged to further prove their value add. Here are some of the ways they can with regard to private market investments. ​ With private market investments becoming more accessible to individual investors, advisors can distinguish themselves by developing deep expertise in this market. Understanding the nuances of private assets, including their risk profiles and liquidity constraints, will be crucial.​ More financial advisors are differentiating themselves from their peers by building knowledge on the private markets. Whether providing liquidity to clients who are early employees or investors in startups or knowing the ins and outs of secondary transactions, they prove their value by their expertise in a growing, but niche market. Advisors can also consider expanding their product suite to include differentiated options that are best-suited to their clients’ individual needs. This could involve partnerships with platforms that offer access to private investments or advisors developing in-house capabilities to evaluate and recommend private assets.​ RIAs tell me that their clients seek access to the technology companies at the forefront of innovation in industries such as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. There are different avenues to provide this access—each with different time horizons, investment minimums and investment structures. Much like they have with direct indexing in public portfolios, advisors can identify and curate private market products for their specific clients. As private market investments become integrated into portfolios, educating clients about these assets becomes imperative. While the private market is growing rapidly, it can still be opaque and daunting to the uninformed. Talking with clients about private investments’ potential benefits and risks will build trust.​ Not every private market investment is right for every client. Advisors can help clients understand their options and choose the most appropriate investments for their situation and goals. The financial market is undergoing a massive change as alternatives—once a wealth creation avenue only available for the ultra-wealthy—go mainstream. With the number of public companies continuing to diminish, it is more important than ever to offer this access to clients of all sizes. I steadfastly believe that the future of investments is in the private market. BlackRock’s vocal endorsement of private markets is a clarion call for financial advisors to evolve and meet this moment. By deepening their understanding of private assets, diversifying their offerings and educating clients, advisors can differentiate themselves while providing enhanced value in this new investment era. Embracing this shift is not just about staying competitive. It’s about leading the way in democratizing access to investment opportunities for all. Not all pre-IPO companies will go public or be acquired, and not all IPOs or acquisitions are or will become successful investments. There are inherent risks in pre-IPO investments, including the risk of loss of the entire investment, illiquidity, and fluctuations in value and returns. Investors must be able to afford the loss of their entire investment.

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Powered by Adelaide, Forbes AI GUANGZHOU, CHINA - APRIL 30: Passengers have their body temperature measured before taking a WeRide ... More L4 autonomous driving bus on April 30, 2022 in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province of China. Passengers can experience the driverless bus line in Guangzhou, which opens for a test ride from Saturday. (Photo by Chen Jimin/China News Service via Getty Images) Updated, May 7, 2025: This post has been adjusted to include information from Uber's Q1 2025 earnings report. Shares in WeRide, a China-based autonomous vehicle technology provider, popped 40% Tuesday, according to Google Finance. Why? The $2.6 billion market capitalization company is partnering with Uber — which is adding $100 million to its investment in WeRide — to expand its robotaxi services from Abu Dhabi to 15 more cities worldwide by 2030, according to CnEV Post. Should investors buy WeRide stock? Although the company’s revenue fell in 2024 and its losses are huge, Uber’s vote of confidence in WeRide could contribute to significant growth and ultimate profitability. WeRide — which operates a driverless commercial Robotaxi service in Beijing and does business in 10 countries — suffered a decline in revenue and a substantial loss in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to the company’s Q4 2024 earnings call transcript. More specifically, in the fourth quarter WeRide’s revenue fell 3% to $15.8 million coupled with a 112% increase in the company’s net loss to $34 million, noted the earnings call transcript. WeRide has the potential to grow rapidly — with positive contribution margins — aided by local partnerships. Outside China, the company provides “autonomous vehicles and services to local partners and global platforms through a combination of selling the vehicles, charging a fixed service fee, and a revenue-sharing arrangement,” WeRide’s Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Li told investors in the earnings call. To be sure, WeRide faces challenges when it introduces autonomous vehicles in a new location. To overcome those challenges, WeRide builds up mutual trust — gradually introducing “automobile driving products, like we can always introduce RoboSweeper at first, and also fixed-route minibus, which the challenges for safety for this product relatively low compared to the requirements for Robotaxi,” WeRide CEO Tony Han told investors, according to the earnings call. This trust has scaled sufficiently for Uber to expand its partnership with WeRide. By 2030, Uber — which already operates a robotaxi service in Abu Dhabi, with Dubai next in line — will roll out WeRide’s Robotaxi services in “15 new cities across Europe and other regions outside of China and the U.S.,” noted TipRanks. The Uber-WeRide partnership splits up the work of operating robotaxis between the two companies based on their mutual strengths. WeRide provides the self-driving technology, while Uber integrates the service into its app and manages fleet operations, TipRanks reported. WeRide offers another advantages to Uber’s efforts to expand autonomous services globally. That’s because WeRide’s presence in 30 cities across 10 countries includes “test licenses in China, UAE, Singapore, France, and the U.S.,” TipRanks reported, which will make it easier for Uber to overcome regulatory barriers to entry in key markets. Uber has other robotaxi partnerships with Waymo, Volkswagen, Avride, May Mobility, and the autonomous trucking company Aurora in the U.S. as well as international partnerships with Pony.AI and Momenta, reported CNBC. Besides its Waymo partnership, Uber has also agreed to work with Volkswagen, Avride, May Mobility, and for autonomous ride-hailing and freight services in the U.S. Uber has additional partnerships with AV companies internationally including with WeRide, Pony.AI and Momenta. Based on analysts’ price targets, WeRide stock has more upside than Uber. Two analysts who cover WeRide set an average price target of $22, according to Zack’s — representing 133% upside. Meanwhile, Uber — which just reported first quarter 2025 results — has less upside. More specifically, the ride-booking giant’s stock has 5.6% upside based on the average price target of 33 analysts of $90.20, noted TipRanks. Uber’s stock fell 1.3% in May 7 trading after reporting a mixed result – in which the company’s revenue fell short of expectations while its earnings per share beat them. Specifically, Uber’s Q1 revenue of $11.53 billion fell $100 million short of London Stock Exchange Group expectations, according to CNBC, while Q1 earnings per share of 80 cents beat analysts’ views by 33 cents. The company’s Waymo Austin launch “exceeded” Uber’s expectations and around 100 Waymo vehicles operating in Austin are now‬‭ “busier than over 99% of all drivers” in Austin as measured by the number completed trips per day, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told CNBC. With the global market for robotaxi services growing at an 80.8% average annual rate to $119 billion by 2031, according to Fortune Business Insights, WeRide stock may have further room to rise with help from the Uber partnership.

May 07, 2025 08:15 ET | Source: Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP OMAHA, Neb., May 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On May 7, 2025, Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP (NYSE: GHI) (the “Partnership”) announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2025. Financial Highlights The Partnership reported the following results as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2025: The difference between reported net income per BUC and CAD per BUC is primarily due to the treatment of unrealized losses on the Partnership’s interest rate derivative positions. Unrealized losses of approximately $3.9 million are included in net income for the three months ended March 31, 2025. Unrealized losses are a result of the impact of decreased market interest rates on the calculated fair value of the Partnership’s interest rate derivative positions. Unrealized gains and losses do not affect our cash earnings and are added back to net income when calculating the Partnership’s CAD. The Partnership received net cash from its interest rate derivative positions totaling approximately $847,000 during the first quarter. In March 2025, the Partnership announced that the Board of Managers of Greystone AF Manager LLC declared a regular quarterly distribution to the Partnership's BUC holders of $0.37 per BUC. The distribution was paid on April 30, 2025, to BUC holders of record as of the close of trading on March 31, 2025. Management Remarks “We continue to evaluate investment opportunities despite continuing market volatility,” said Kenneth C. Rogozinski, the Partnership’s Chief Executive Officer. “Our successful Series B Preferred Units issuance provides low-cost, non-dilutive capital for us to deploy into accretive investment opportunities. In addition, the dedicated pool of capital that we have from the new BlackRock construction lending joint venture is a powerful tool for us to serve our affordable housing developer relationship base.” Recent Investment and Financing Activity The Partnership reported the following updates for the first quarter of 2025: In May 2025, the managing member of Vantage at Helotes sold the property to a governmental entity who in turn leased the property to a non-profit entity. That non-profit entity financed its purchase of the leasehold interest by issuing tax-exempt and taxable bonds. The Partnership received gross proceeds of approximately $17.1 million, inclusive of the return of capital contributions and accrued preferred return. The Partnership expects to recognize investment income of approximately $1.8 million and a gain on sale of approximately $163,000 in the second quarter of 2025, before settlement of final proceeds and expenses. The Partnership expects to recognize approximately $0.08 of net income per BUC, basic and diluted, and CAD per BUC, based on the number of BUCs outstanding on the date of sale.

About Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP was formed in 1998 under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act for the primary purpose of acquiring, holding, selling and otherwise dealing with a portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing for affordable multifamily, seniors and student housing properties. The Partnership is pursuing a business strategy of acquiring additional mortgage revenue bonds and other investments on a leveraged basis. The Partnership expects and believes the interest earned on these mortgage revenue bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. The Partnership seeks to achieve its investment growth strategy by investing in additional mortgage revenue bonds and other investments as permitted by its Second Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement, dated December 5, 2022 (the “Partnership Agreement”), taking advantage of attractive financing structures available in the securities market, and entering into interest rate risk management instruments. Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP press releases are available at www.ghiinvestors.com. Safe Harbor Statement Certain statements in this press release are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for “forward-looking statements” provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by use of statements that include, but are not limited to, phrases such as “believe,” “expect,” “future,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “foresee,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “estimates,” “potential,” “continue,” or other similar words or phrases. Similarly, statements that describe objectives, plans, or goals also are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond the control of the Partnership. The Partnership cautions readers that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, implied, or projected by such forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: defaults on the mortgage loans securing our mortgage revenue bonds and governmental issuer loans; the competitive environment in which the Partnership operates; risks associated with investing in multifamily, student, senior citizen residential properties and commercial properties; general economic, geopolitical, and financial conditions, including the current and future impact of changing interest rates, inflation, and international conflicts (including the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war) on business operations, employment, and financial conditions; uncertain conditions within the domestic and international macroeconomic environment, including monetary and fiscal policy and conditions in the investment, credit, interest rate, and derivatives markets; any effects on our business resulting from new U.S. domestic or foreign governmental trade measures, including but not limited to tariffs, import and export controls, foreign exchange intervention accomplished to offset the effects of trade policy or in response to currency volatility, and other restrictions on free trade; adverse reactions in U.S. financial markets related to actions of foreign central banks or the economic performance of foreign economies, including in particular China, Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom; the general condition of the real estate markets in the regions in which the Partnership operates, which may be unfavorably impacted by pressures in the commercial real estate sector, incrementally higher unemployment rates, persistent elevated inflation levels, and other factors; changes in interest rates and credit spreads, as well as the success of any hedging strategies the Partnership may undertake in relation to such changes, and the effect such changes may have on the relative spreads between the yield on investments and cost of financing; the aggregate effect of elevated inflation levels over the past several years, spurred by multiple factors including expansionary monetary and fiscal policy, higher commodity prices, a tight labor market, and low residential vacancy rates, which may result in continued elevated interest rate levels and increased market volatility; the Partnership’s ability to access debt and equity capital to finance its assets; current maturities of the Partnership’s financing arrangements and the Partnership’s ability to renew or refinance such financing arrangements; local, regional, national and international economic and credit market conditions; recapture of previously issued Low Income Housing Tax Credits in accordance with Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code; geographic concentration of properties related to investments held by the Partnership; changes in the U.S. corporate tax code and other government regulations affecting the Partnership’s business; and the other risks detailed in the Partnership’s SEC filings (including but not limited to, the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K). Readers are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements. If any of these risks or uncertainties materializes or if any of the assumptions underlying such forward-looking statements proves to be incorrect, the developments and future events concerning the Partnership set forth in this press release may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these statements, which speak only as of the date of this document. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our expectations and beliefs to change. The Partnership assumes no obligation to update such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, unless obligated to do so under the federal securities laws. Disclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Measures - Cash Available for Distribution The Partnership believes that CAD provides relevant information about the Partnership’s operations and is necessary, along with net income, for understanding its operating results. To calculate CAD, the Partnership begins with net income as computed in accordance with GAAP and adjusts for non-cash expenses or income consisting of depreciation expense, amortization expense related to deferred financing costs, amortization of premiums and discounts, fair value adjustments to derivative instruments, provisions for credit and loan losses, impairments on MRBs, GILs, real estate assets and property loans, deferred income tax expense (benefit), and restricted unit compensation expense. The Partnership also adjusts net income for the Partnership’s share of (earnings) losses of investments in unconsolidated entities as such amounts are primarily depreciation expenses and development costs that are expected to be recovered upon an exit event. The Partnership also deducts Tier 2 income (see Note 22 to the Partnership’s condensed consolidated financial statements) distributable to the General Partner as defined in the Partnership Agreement and distributions and accretion for the Preferred Units. Net income is the GAAP measure most comparable to CAD. There is no generally accepted methodology for computing CAD, and the Partnership’s computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other companies. Although the Partnership considers CAD to be a useful measure of the Partnership’s operating performance, CAD is a non-GAAP measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP, or any other measures of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table shows the calculation of CAD (and a reconciliation of the Partnership’s net income, as determined in accordance with GAAP, to CAD) for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 (all per BUC amounts are presented giving effect to the BUCs Distributions described in Note 22 of the condensed consolidated financial statements on a retroactive basis for all periods presented): MEDIA CONTACT: Karen Marotta Greystone 212-896-9149 Karen.Marotta@greyco.com INVESTOR CONTACT:Andy GrierInvestors Relations402-952-1235 OMAHA, Neb., April 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP (NYSE: GHI) (the “Partnership”) announced today that it will host a conference call for investors on Wednesday,...

More mobile phone screen with the AI (artificial intelligence) revolution symbol in the background. (Photo Illustration by Idrees Abbas/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Despite posting impressive quarterly results, Arista Networks (NASDAQ: ANET) saw an unexpected market reaction. The company delivered solid numbers with sales reaching $2.0 billion (up 27.6% year-over-year) and adjusted earnings of $0.65 per share (up from $0.50 last year). Both figures beat Wall Street expectations of $1.97 billion in sales and $0.59 EPS. As an aside, will Tesla get back to basics? See Tesla’s Lost Cause. Adding to the good news, Arista’s Q2 outlook of $2.1 billion exceeded consensus estimates, and they announced a $1.5 billion share buyback program. Normally, these would be ingredients for a stock rally, but instead, ANET dropped 5% in after-hours trading. Clearly, ANET stock is volatile, and if you are looking for potential upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – What’s Next For HIMS Stock After A Solid Q1? So what happened? Investors were clearly hoping for even more, especially considering major tech companies have maintained their AI-related capital expenditure plans. The question now: Does it make sense to buy ANET at $86 (after-hours price)? We think absolutely. At $86 (after market), ANET trades at 15x trailing revenues, just slightly above its three-year average P/S ratio of 14x. We believe a higher valuation multiple is justified given Arista’s strong position in the AI space, with companies like Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, and Google making up a significant portion of sales while remaining committed to AI expansion. With sales growth projected in the high teens over the next few years, the premium valuation makes sense. Bottom line: Investors should consider using this dip in ANET stock as an opportunity to buy for solid long-term gains. For investors aiming to reduce the inherent volatility associated with individual stocks like Arista Networks, there are alternative investment strategies available. The Trefis RV strategy, which has a history of outperforming its all-cap stock benchmark, provides a diversified approach to potentially achieve solid returns. Likewise, the High-Quality portfolio has shown superior performance compared to the S&P 500 with returns that exceed 91% since its initiation, offering potential upside with reduced stock-specific risk.

Today is the start of the REAL ID requirement at airport security checkpoints, but if you don’t have one, don’t panic. Most people will still be allowed to fly, according to U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. A standard, state-issued driver’s license is no longer enough to get through security—you’ll need one that typically has a star in the upper right corner, though each state’s version looks different. And while you may get through security without a REAL ID, it could mean going through extra screening, so plan to arrive three hours ahead of your flight. The requirement, aimed at improving security, has been long-delayed. But if you have a passport or one of roughly a dozen other compliant forms of identification, there’s no need to rush on obtaining a REAL ID. An army soldier stands guard on the rooftop of a mosque building damaged by a suspected Indian ... More missile attack near Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan controlled Kashmir. (AP Photo/M.D. Mughal) India launched missile strikes in Pakistan Wednesday, two weeks after it accused Pakistan of being involved in a terrorist attack on the tourist town of Pahalgam that killed over two dozen people. Pakistani officials denounced the strikes, calling them “an unprovoked and blatant act of war.” The nuclear-armed nations have been at odds for decades, but tensions have risen in recent weeks following the Pahalgam attack. Even as AI models become more advanced, they’re increasingly prone to hallucinations, or false information created by false reasoning, presenting a challenge for the industry. For instance, company tests show OpenAI’s newest o3 and o4-mini models have hallucinated 30-50% of the time, and it’s unclear why. U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell Despite demands from President Donald Trump, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to slash interest rates as the central bank’s rate-setting committee meets this week. Economists at the three largest investment banks all predict the Fed will keep rates steady as it grapples with inflation that remains above its 2% target. Legal AI startup Legora is in talks to raise $85 million in funding at a $675 million valuation, following a string of deals with big name law firms. The firm’s software helps lawyers draft contracts, review and analyze documents, and run checks against legal databases, automating some of the most repetitive and tedious tasks for attorneys. Amazon-owned robotaxi firm Zoox has issued a software recall for 270 of its vehicles after an unoccupied Zoox robotaxi collided with a passenger vehicle in Las Vegas last month. The incident didn’t result in any injuries, and the robotaxis are back on the road, but it adds to a series of challenges for the fledgling industry. The Trump Organization disclosed in a filing submitted to British regulators that President Donald Trump retains influence over the trust that controls one of his U.K. golf resorts and, via a web of additional entities, virtually every other asset in his empire. By stating that Trump has control over the trust, his own business appears to admit that Trump maintains a grip on his business empire, despite some efforts to portray separation. The Supreme Court allowed the Trump Administration’s transgender military ban to take effect again while a legal case against it moves forward. A lower court had paused the policy, but it is now in effect until it potentially comes back to the highest court again. an airport control tower at Newark Liberty International Airport Newly released audio reveals that air traffic controllers temporarily lost all contact with planes approaching Newark Airport on April 28. Following the incident, some air traffic controllers took time off, and a shortage of controllers has caused hundreds of delayed and canceled flights at the airport over the past week. In recent days, President Donald Trump and top advisor Stephen Miller have suggested immigrants may not be entitled to due process before being deported, as the Trump Administration faces pushback over its mass deportation plans. But that conflicts with longstanding legal precedent: In 1993, conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court that “the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings.” For a variety of reasons, elite college admissions are becoming an impossible dream—even for perfect students. Today, 19 of 20 applications submitted to nearly all of the schools in the Ivy League are rejected. And it’s not just the super elite: Admission rates are plunging at popular schools like Northeastern University and New York University. Lower admissions rates lead to more stress and more heartbreak. But while the traditional May 1 decision deadline has come and gone, it’s not too late to secure a college acceptance for the fall term. Through April and May, hundreds of colleges report to the National Association for College Admission Counselors that they still have seats available in their incoming freshman classes. As of Wednesday, 281 colleges told NACAC they’re still seeking applicants. Many of these colleges are excellent, and in an effort to highlight the best colleges in need of freshmen, Forbes has culled the list for schools that appear on the 2025 Forbes Top Colleges list, as well as the Princeton Review’s 2025 list of Best Colleges. One option is the University of San Francisco, a private Jesuit university that is popular for health professions programs. And if internships are a goal, Philadelphia’s Drexel University, with 12,000 undergraduates and 100 majors and minors, is known for its co-op program, which places students in paying jobs for six-month stints at employers like Comcast, Dupont, Estee Lauder, Vanguard and Johnson & Johnson. WHY IT MATTERS “Heading into high school graduation season without a college admission offer is disheartening, no doubt, but it’s not time to give up on college ambitions,” says Forbes staff writer Emma Whitford. “Students who didn’t get any college acceptances still have plenty of excellent schools to apply to for the fall, and a strong transfer application to your dream school next spring will fare better than a first-year application following a gap year.” MORE America’s Top Colleges If trade negotiations fall through, the European Union could consider placing additional tariffs on more than $110 billion in U.S. exports. That would impact everything from cars to oil and gas: $10 billion: The worth of new cars exported from the U.S. to the EU in 2023 3.5%: The share of all U.S. global exports that went to Germany in 2022 Nearly 1 million: The number of jobs in the U.S. supported by trade in services with the EU in 2023 With layoffs in the news, it’s natural to worry that your position could be on the chopping block. In a recent survey, HR directors and managers identified five red flags that could signal a role could be eliminated, including whether a position can be replaced by AI, or if the role relies on outdated skillsets. Consider making a career pivot that leverages your skills if your position is at risk of automation, and make sure to regularly assess your performance with your boss.

Let Banking Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The investment fintech, targeting a $4 billion valuation, is expected to launch on the Nasdaq index May 14. Social investment fintech eToro is seeking to raise $500 million through its initial public offering in the U.S., targeting a valuation of $4 billion and an expected IPO date of May 14. The firm and some of its shareholders are offering 10 million shares for between $46 and $50 each, according to a securities filing, half of which are being offered by the company and half by the shareholders. Founded in 2007 in Tel Aviv, Israel by brothers Yoni Assia and Ronen Assia and cofounder David Ring, eToro is a social trading app that allows users to replicate the trading strategies of top investors. It has over 40 million users, according to the securities filing. After first filing in late March, eToro put a hold on its IPO pursuit due to tariff-related market volatility that followed President Donald Trump’s major tariffs announcement in early April, Bloomberg reported. Buy now,pay later fintech Klarna also paused its IPO for the same reason, The Wall Street Journal reported. But in eToro’s May 5 IPO filing, the company said that certain funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, the firm’s cornerstone investor, have indicated an interest in purchasing as much as $100 million in shares at the IPO price. For 2024, eToro reported a net contribution of $787 million in 2024 and net income of $192 million. The figures represent a 41% increase and 1,161% increase, respectively, from the prior year, according to the filing. The company is in a quiet period following the IPO filing and did not provide comment beyond the press release. eToro was among the firms named by fintech investor Nigel Morris, QED Investors co-founder, as part of a “generation” likely to file IPOs this year. “In 2021, there were 61 fintech IPOs,” he said during his keynote at Fintech Meetup in March. “Since 2021, there’s been a total of 13.” “Now we have a cohort of companies that are at scale, they’re profitable, they’re growing fast, that have business models that make sense,” he said, naming Klarna, Circle and eToro. All three have since filed an IPO. “Notwithstanding the turbulence of the angry markets this week and today … there’s no doubt that these companies are IPO-ready and will be [in] the right window, either at the end of this quarter or next quarter, that will see a whole generation of them,” Morris said. “And with that, there’ll be a wave of valuations that are market-tested … these are really powerful and capable companies.” eToro’s IPO is being led by Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, UBS and Citi. Shares are expected to trade under the ticker symbol ETOR on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.

Title: When The CEO Is The Corporate Brand: How To Manage Reputational Risks

ByBrian Cattell ByBrian Cattell, Forbes Councils Member. Brian Cattell, Managing Partner at CLP Strategies, a strategic communications firm with offices in New York City and London. It’s not new for charismatic CEOs to be the face of the corporations they lead. In 2025, however, with many business leaders seeming to be either permanently on social media, on TV or quoted in the newspapers, many CEOs have effectively become the company brand. It’s not just the extreme examples like Elon Musk. More sober but still ubiquitous corporate titans such as Andy Jassy of Amazon, Jensen Huang of Nvidia or Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Today’s rapidly evolving ecosystem of new digital, social and legacy media platforms means that these executives are in the spotlight more than any others in corporate history. In many ways, today’s CEOs are behaving more like influencers. They comment on market trends, share views on AI and even weigh in on how everyday people spend their free time. Every post or statement is instantly shared, analyzed and judged. As a result, corporate communications teams must now manage not only the company’s brand but also a highly visible, human brand—one that’s imperfect, spontaneous and constantly speaking. Consider WK Kellogg CEO Gary Pilnick’s infamous "let them eat cake" moment in 2024. In a CNBC interview, Pilnick suggested cereal as a low-cost dinner option amid rising food prices—claiming it could feed a family for just $1. The backlash was swift. His comments went viral, drawing sharp criticism online from people who saw the remarks as tone-deaf and out of touch. Although Pilnick—new to the role at the time—kept his job and WK Kellogg avoided lasting damage, it’s safe to assume his communications team likely spent several intense days managing the fallout. How can a company let a CEO be themselves and convey authenticity without a script while safely representing the corporate brand without undue reputational risk? There’s no doubt that authenticity has value—genuine, unfiltered communication can build trust with both internal and external audiences. Live videos, spontaneous interviews and off-the-cuff Q&As often resonate more than polished scripts. But these moments also carry serious risks. A casual, poorly worded remark can easily veer off-message, triggering internal frustration among employees or, worse, sparking public backlash. Anything from political opinion to comments about layoffs, the workforce and much more are at risk of being misinterpreted. So, how should the internal communications team or external advisers to the corporation manage these new risks? First, media training needs to go beyond traditional TV or print media. It now needs to cover the right tone and body language for TikTok or Instagram, LinkedIn etiquette and dealing with live comments from customers or employees in an open forum environment. Before CEOs go out into the world to communicate, there needs to be some deep thinking about content strategy. It needs to balance personal branding for the individual with corporate messaging. Don’t forget to plan for different scenarios. Comms teams, particularly those supporting high-profile business leaders, should have a multistep plan that follows the possibility of their CEO’s comment or post going viral for the wrong reason. Finally, PRs have been practicing the art of rapid rebuttal in the media for decades. In today’s environment, speed for response across all content verticals is just as critical. Prepare well and be ready to step in should things go south. The great paradox of the modern CEO as the corporate brand is that it stems from a desire to be relatable to many more people than were traditionally reached by the words and actions of company executives. However, by striving to be relatable through greater public exposure, business leaders increase their risk of doing or saying the wrong thing. If that happens, they end up being anything but the person that someone would love to have a beer with. While high-profile gaffes often dominate headlines, a CEO’s internal reputation can be just as critical. When the CEO embodies the company’s identity, their mistakes don’t just damage the brand externally—they can also shake confidence within the organization. Misjudged statements—especially during sensitive moments like layoffs or changes to DEI or remote work policies—can spark anything from employee backlash to public criticism. As a result, communications teams must now monitor internal sentiment as closely as they do media, customer and investor reactions. The challenge for those managing a CEO brand in 2025 is to balance risk and reward. The leader’s voice can be a very powerful tool, but it requires careful management, strategy and real-time monitoring. In an age where saying the wrong thing can spark a consumer boycott or an employee walkout, the CEO doesn’t just speak for the company—they often are the company.

Crypto institutional investors ramp up inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs following a swift recovery and expected price consolidation. The last seven days saw a net jump in total digital asset products alongside soaring trading volumes. As institutional sentiment spikes, traders are primed for a run above $100k, although certain macro indicators could hinder the upward drive. On-chain data shows spot Bitcoin ETFs added $1.8 billion, triggering bullish sentiments in the last seven days. This comes from renewed speculation for a massive price jump in May. Following the last dip and the recovery, which kicked off in the previous two weeks, traders began high-end accumulations seeking to break new positions. Traditional investors also caught the wave as they shifted through gears. According to SoSoValue data, net inflows topped $40.25 billion on May 2, marking the highest level since Feb 11. These products gained traction after the previous two months as the White House lowered tariff pressure. The previous week saw a much larger $3 billion inflow coming off a string of outflows. Currently, bull pressures are backed by new centralized institutions increasing their appetite for the asset class. Firms like Strategy and Metaplanet have intensified acquisitions in the same period. Last month, Cantor, Tether, SoftBank, and Bitfinex announced plans to roll out a Bitcoin acquisition firm. This influx of institutional demand has shaped trader confidence as they aim for new cycle peaks. Per pseudonymous Bitcoin enthusiast BlockChair, metrics are strengthening due to huge ETF inflows. “Institutional adoption of Bitcoin continues to accelerate. With spot ETFs absorbing 6x the weekly mined supply and BlackRock dominating holdings, the supply squeeze narrative grows stronger. A 2% BTC allocation across traditional portfolios would indeed be transformative.” For most digital asset commentators, the next point is another push through the $95k price to set the tone for a larger $100k level. After swings in the past few months, this psychological level remains important for Bitcoin holders. Bitcoin price dropped 22% from an all-time high above $108k, ushering in fresh outflows in the wider market. If the price reclaims $100k this month, bulls’ projections could be in play due to skyrocketing institutional inflows and on-chain metrics. Long-term holders are back in the green zone, spiking new retail investors.

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File photo Uber Technologies missed quarterly revenue estimates as growth in its ride-hailing unit slowed to its weakest since the pandemic, stirring fears of slowing demand against the backdrop of a murky economic outlook and clouding an upbeat forecast. Shares of the company fell about 8 per cent before clawing back some ground to be down 5 per cent in premarket trading on Wednesday. Total revenue rose 14 per cent to $11.53 billion in the first quarter, compared with analysts' expectations of $11.62 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Uber has struggled to match the high growth from the post-pandemic quarters and is also contending with lower ride prices with some customers seeking cheaper transport options.

Title: Facebook stole my book to train its AI. The insult wasn't the money
URL: https://qz.com/meta-facebook-ai-mark-zuckerberg-books-llama-theft-1851779221
Time Published: 2025-05-07T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
It started with an email from my literary agent. “You might’ve heard about LibGen and books being used to train AI,” she wrote. “A search of the database shows that Poe for Your Problems is on the list.” I had seen the headline, back in March, in The Atlantic: “Meta (META) pirated millions of books to train its AI,” it screamed. But to my shame, I hadn’t actually read the piece. I had been too busy writing for Quartz (as now) and chasing my four-year-old around the house. Life goes on, even when someone steals your intellectual property. Yet there it was. The story detailed how Meta employees had downloaded tens of gigabytes of pirated books from LibGen, a well-known “shadow library” that hosts roughly eight million titles. They used these files to help train LLaMA 3, the company’s most advanced language model. Internal discussions, unsealed earlier this year as part of an ongoing lawsuit, show that Meta’s engineers explicitly debated the legal risks and chose to proceed anyway, looking to save both time and money. The documents further suggest that top leadership signed off on the maneuver. “Eventually, the team at Meta got permission from ‘MZ’ — an apparent reference to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — to download and use the data set,” The Atlantic reported. In response, a group of authors including Sarah Silverman have filed a class action lawsuit, now winding its way through the legal system. Instead, I was relieved. My little book had been deemed important enough to steal! Thank goodness. The greater shame would’ve been not being pirated, considering the scale of the theft. I turned to a friend who happened to be standing nearby and said, “It’s just nice to be included.” If that seems like a perverse reaction, well, it conveys how humbling it can be to achieve your lifelong author dreams. Many people dream of publishing a book someday — I had since I was eight years old — but becoming an author is a lesson in humility, at least in my experience. You show up at a bookstore to give a reading to five people, two of whom are your dad’s cousins. You do podcast interviews in which the host greets you with, “So I haven’t had time to read your book… can you remind me what it’s about and who you are?” Like I said: humbling. But the relief quickly curdled as I remembered what it had been like to sell the book in the first place. Nonfiction is sold on proposal — which means you don’t write the book, you write a 40-page business plan for the book. I spent years on mine, rewriting it three separate times. I got upwards of two dozen rejections before it finally went to auction and found a home with a Hachette subsidiary in 2019. After that, it took another year to write the actual book. When it came out in 2021, I spent thousands of hours promoting it. My advance was $20,000 — not nothing. But that was before taxes and my agent’s 15% cut. I once calculated that I’d earned less than the federal minimum wage for writing the book. Since it “earned out” in 2023 (meaning the publisher fully made back its costs), I’ve received another $10,000 in royalties. Those checks are always welcome, but they’re also pre-tax couch change compared to the time, energy, and ambition that went into the work. It’s hard to explain just how difficult it is to land a publishing deal, especially with one of the “Big Four.” Unless you’re an Obama or a Kardashian, it’s nearly impossible. Publishing is a perpetually precarious industry, surviving year to year on breakout hits like Atomic Habits or It Ends With Us. Even the largest publishers operate on net margins of about 6%. That doesn’t leave much room for risk. So they’re understandably reluctant to bet on an unproven author with an odd idea. I got around the issue of not being famous myself by writing about someone who was: my literary hero, Edgar Allan Poe. But that didn’t make things easy. Selling a self-help book based on the life of history’s most miserable writer was, perhaps unsurprisingly, an uphill battle. And while my genre — irreverent self-help, sometimes called “anti-self-help” — is relatively common now, it wasn’t when I was knocking on doors, metaphorical hat in hand. Putting together a convincing business case was hard enough. Writing the actual book — 55,000 words of deeply researched, counterintuitive argument — was harder still. “To coin one’s brain into silver, at the nod of a master, is to my thinking, the hardest task in the world,” Poe once wrote. It’s no less true when you’re the master, too. Today, Amazon sells my book for $12.99. My cut of that is $2.25. And that’s too steep a price tag for Meta? A company worth $1.5 trillion, helmed by a founder with a $200 billion net worth? Mark Zuckerberg owns about 13% of Meta stock. He could’ve paid me $2.25 — the amount I earn per sale — almost 89 billion times. Or he could’ve just bought a single copy, which would’ve cost him 0.0000011% of his wealth. Assuming a $20 sticker price on each of the 7.5 million pirated books, actually paying for all of them would’ve cost about $150 million — not even one-tenth of one percent of Zuckerberg’s fortune. Me? I would’ve come out $2.25 better. I could’ve bought a Snickers, depending on the gas station. Surely the world’s third-richest man could swing that. If you want to understand the artist’s dilemma in the AI age, it’s this: Do something singular, something that takes years of obsessive creative labor — then watch it get stolen by someone for whom $150 million is a rounding error. In that light, it’s not just theft. It’s bullying. Exploitation. Looting on a grand scale. The stuff of Upton Sinclair. Only we don’t have robber barons anymore. We have pirate captains. Bluebeards of the human heart. And what are we supposed to fight them with? Carefully worded emails? That’s like bringing a spork to a nuclear war. Some authors think publishers should be the ones leading the charge. “I checked one of the sites,” the novelist Domenica Ruta told me, “and yes, both my former books were used to train AI. I’m furious and feel utterly powerless about what to do. My take is that publishers — who absolutely have the resources — need to be the frontline defenders against this. They need to protect their authors and our work. As individuals we have little power. A Big Four publisher has a lot more influence.” When Facebook came to power and popularity circa 2010, we at least understood the bargain: In exchange for our data, we got to post above-average-cute photos of ourselves, and learn our relatives’ reprehensible political views. The calculation has shifted since, with Meta stealing something much more intimate, deeply personal, and hard-won than data. If I’d plagiarized someone’s book, I’d be in trouble. I’d go to court, face consequences, quite likely be publicly shamed. That’s not what’s happening to Zuckerberg. Instead, he hangs out at the White House. If you walked into Barnes & Noble and stole a $13 book, you’d get the police called on you. But steal 7.5 million, and you’ll make billions. It’s an object lesson in contemporary law enforcement: the bigger the crime, the more likely you are to get away with it. By the same token, shoplift some disposable razors and you’re a menace, a criminal. Steal 7.5 million books and you’re a visionary. That’s the math now. People love to obsess about thefts of toothpaste and Tide Pods at CVS (CVS) in San Francisco, but plunder on an epic scale just slightly further south and you’ll not only walk away untouched, you’ll emerge vastly richer. It’s hard to think this wasn’t Meta’s whole calculus to begin with. Gamble big, make billions, and let the lawsuits drag on. A lawyer friend of mine put it plainly: The copyright cases are about to enter discovery in both New York and California, and Meta is likely to lose. But by then, the damage will be done. As they said, “No one loves to read more than lawyers and judges.” In the meantime, the industry is already eyeing a workaround by lobbying the executive branch directly. Here’s the part I really hate to say: I don’t think they can be stopped either, whatever the class action lawsuit does. Facebook has faced down governments. It’s currently facing down the FTC and the European Union. And beyond Facebook, vast as it is, there’s the whole AI wave we’re all riding, if unequally. Companies like Meta, Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) are likely to reap long-term trillions by creating AI tools and programs. I’ve covered the stock market for more than a decade and I’ve never seen economic logic so relentless. Meanwhile, artists and white-collar workers are losing their livelihoods on top of the knowledge and ingenuity that’s already been stolen from them. To coin one’s brain into silver — and watch it be scraped by AI — is enough to make you question the point of doing it in the first place. Lest I seem knee-jerk anti-capitalist, I should add that I come at all this as an author and a shareholder. Checking my Etrade (MS) just now, I see I own about $31,000 in Meta stock. That’s in a regular, non-retirement brokerage account and doesn’t include shares I own indirectly through index and mutual funds. I started buying the stock circa the IPO because I’ve long recognized the wealth-creation dynamics of our era: Hard work may or may not pay off, but invest in companies like Meta and you can ride along for the extra-legal wealth they’re likely to create. It’s the surer thing. So I don’t begrudge Meta its $16.4 billion quarterly profit, not necessarily. But as a shareholder, I don’t want it earned through theft. And as a writer, I feel the same way. You want so badly to enter the cultural DNA. But if it means you get erased, robbed, exploited? Not so much. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

But the relief quickly curdled as I remembered what it had been like to sell the book in the first place. Nonfiction is sold on proposal — which means you don’t write the book, you write a 40-page business plan for the book. I spent years on mine, rewriting it three separate times. I got upwards of two dozen rejections before it finally went to auction and found a home with a Hachette subsidiary in 2019. After that, it took another year to write the actual book. When it came out in 2021, I spent thousands of hours promoting it. My advance was $20,000 — not nothing. But that was before taxes and my agent’s 15% cut. I once calculated that I’d earned less than the federal minimum wage for writing the book. Since it “earned out” in 2023 (meaning the publisher fully made back its costs), I’ve received another $10,000 in royalties. Those checks are always welcome, but they’re also pre-tax couch change compared to the time, energy, and ambition that went into the work. It’s hard to explain just how difficult it is to land a publishing deal, especially with one of the “Big Four.” Unless you’re an Obama or a Kardashian, it’s nearly impossible. Publishing is a perpetually precarious industry, surviving year to year on breakout hits like Atomic Habits or It Ends With Us. Even the largest publishers operate on net margins of about 6%. That doesn’t leave much room for risk. So they’re understandably reluctant to bet on an unproven author with an odd idea. I got around the issue of not being famous myself by writing about someone who was: my literary hero, Edgar Allan Poe. But that didn’t make things easy. Selling a self-help book based on the life of history’s most miserable writer was, perhaps unsurprisingly, an uphill battle. And while my genre — irreverent self-help, sometimes called “anti-self-help” — is relatively common now, it wasn’t when I was knocking on doors, metaphorical hat in hand. Putting together a convincing business case was hard enough. Writing the actual book — 55,000 words of deeply researched, counterintuitive argument — was harder still. “To coin one’s brain into silver, at the nod of a master, is to my thinking, the hardest task in the world,” Poe once wrote. It’s no less true when you’re the master, too. Today, Amazon sells my book for $12.99. My cut of that is $2.25. And that’s too steep a price tag for Meta? A company worth $1.5 trillion, helmed by a founder with a $200 billion net worth? Mark Zuckerberg owns about 13% of Meta stock. He could’ve paid me $2.25 — the amount I earn per sale — almost 89 billion times. Or he could’ve just bought a single copy, which would’ve cost him 0.0000011% of his wealth. Assuming a $20 sticker price on each of the 7.5 million pirated books, actually paying for all of them would’ve cost about $150 million — not even one-tenth of one percent of Zuckerberg’s fortune. Me? I would’ve come out $2.25 better. I could’ve bought a Snickers, depending on the gas station. Surely the world’s third-richest man could swing that. If you want to understand the artist’s dilemma in the AI age, it’s this: Do something singular, something that takes years of obsessive creative labor — then watch it get stolen by someone for whom $150 million is a rounding error. In that light, it’s not just theft. It’s bullying. Exploitation. Looting on a grand scale. The stuff of Upton Sinclair. Only we don’t have robber barons anymore. We have pirate captains. Bluebeards of the human heart. And what are we supposed to fight them with? Carefully worded emails? That’s like bringing a spork to a nuclear war. Some authors think publishers should be the ones leading the charge. “I checked one of the sites,” the novelist Domenica Ruta told me, “and yes, both my former books were used to train AI. I’m furious and feel utterly powerless about what to do. My take is that publishers — who absolutely have the resources — need to be the frontline defenders against this. They need to protect their authors and our work. As individuals we have little power. A Big Four publisher has a lot more influence.” When Facebook came to power and popularity circa 2010, we at least understood the bargain: In exchange for our data, we got to post above-average-cute photos of ourselves, and learn our relatives’ reprehensible political views. The calculation has shifted since, with Meta stealing something much more intimate, deeply personal, and hard-won than data. If I’d plagiarized someone’s book, I’d be in trouble. I’d go to court, face consequences, quite likely be publicly shamed. That’s not what’s happening to Zuckerberg. Instead, he hangs out at the White House. If you walked into Barnes & Noble and stole a $13 book, you’d get the police called on you. But steal 7.5 million, and you’ll make billions. It’s an object lesson in contemporary law enforcement: the bigger the crime, the more likely you are to get away with it. By the same token, shoplift some disposable razors and you’re a menace, a criminal. Steal 7.5 million books and you’re a visionary. That’s the math now. People love to obsess about thefts of toothpaste and Tide Pods at CVS (CVS) in San Francisco, but plunder on an epic scale just slightly further south and you’ll not only walk away untouched, you’ll emerge vastly richer. It’s hard to think this wasn’t Meta’s whole calculus to begin with. Gamble big, make billions, and let the lawsuits drag on. A lawyer friend of mine put it plainly: The copyright cases are about to enter discovery in both New York and California, and Meta is likely to lose. But by then, the damage will be done. As they said, “No one loves to read more than lawyers and judges.” In the meantime, the industry is already eyeing a workaround by lobbying the executive branch directly. Here’s the part I really hate to say: I don’t think they can be stopped either, whatever the class action lawsuit does. Facebook has faced down governments. It’s currently facing down the FTC and the European Union. And beyond Facebook, vast as it is, there’s the whole AI wave we’re all riding, if unequally. Companies like Meta, Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) are likely to reap long-term trillions by creating AI tools and programs. I’ve covered the stock market for more than a decade and I’ve never seen economic logic so relentless. Meanwhile, artists and white-collar workers are losing their livelihoods on top of the knowledge and ingenuity that’s already been stolen from them. To coin one’s brain into silver — and watch it be scraped by AI — is enough to make you question the point of doing it in the first place. Lest I seem knee-jerk anti-capitalist, I should add that I come at all this as an author and a shareholder. Checking my Etrade (MS) just now, I see I own about $31,000 in Meta stock. That’s in a regular, non-retirement brokerage account and doesn’t include shares I own indirectly through index and mutual funds. I started buying the stock circa the IPO because I’ve long recognized the wealth-creation dynamics of our era: Hard work may or may not pay off, but invest in companies like Meta and you can ride along for the extra-legal wealth they’re likely to create. It’s the surer thing. So I don’t begrudge Meta its $16.4 billion quarterly profit, not necessarily. But as a shareholder, I don’t want it earned through theft. And as a writer, I feel the same way. You want so badly to enter the cultural DNA. But if it means you get erased, robbed, exploited? Not so much. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Business FILE PHOTO: Dark clouds are seen over the building of the European Central Bank (ECB) before the ECB's monetary policy meeting in Frankfurt, Germany, June 6, 2024. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo LONDON : The rush to cut interest rates at major central banks slowed to a trickle in April, as policymakers faced uncertainty on the outlook for economic growth and inflation in the wake of escalating trade tensions. Two of the five central banks overseeing the 10 most heavily traded currencies that held meetings in April - the European Central Bank and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand – lowered interest rates by a cumulative 50 basis points. Rate setters in Australia, Japan and Canada left benchmarks unchanged, while central banks in Sweden, Switzerland, Norway, Britain and the United States did not meet in April. In February, half of the G10 central banks cut interest rates. The main focus now shifts to the U.S. Federal Reserve, which concludes its rate setting meeting later on Wednesday.

Title: IBIT acquires 5,613 BTC worth $530M in one day – Details and effects!

Is BlackRock triggering the next crypto bull run? BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has reignited investor momentum with a powerful streak of 15 straight days of inflows. This has simply underscored renewed institutional confidence in Bitcoin [BTC]. On 5 May alone, the asset manager acquired 5,613 BTC, valued at approximately $530 million – Solidifying IBIT’s dominance in a week where most other ETFs saw flat or negative flows. With total inflows since inception now surpassing $44 billion, BlackRock’s aggressive accumulation reinforces its outsized influence on the broader crypto ETF landscape. It also means that institutional appetite for Bitcoin exposure remains strong. Remarking on the same, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas took to X and noted, “Deja vu in the weekly flows w/ $VOO and $IBIT in the top spots, just like last year when ‘beta with a side of bitcoin’ was the big theme. $IBIT now 8th in YTD flows (was out of Top 50 at one point) with +$6.4b. Been hoovering up btc like a madman ever since the decoupling.” In the thread, he further added, “One interesting note also is $IBIT taking in SO much more then the rest of them (altho 10 of them have seen inflows). Usually there’s much more parity tho. Why is this? My theory, return of the HF basis trade and some big fish biting after the decoupling and subsequent rally.” Additionally, Bitcoin’s stability above the $90,000 threshold, even after a modest 0.42% dip in the last 24 hours, alluded to growing confidence in the asset’s long-term trajectory. This price level, once seen as highly ambitious, now might be a stepping stone towards the psychological $100,000-mark. Notably, key technical indicators such as the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) were in bullish territory at press time. This reinforced the idea that short-term dips may be part of a healthy consolidation phase, rather than a reversal. Source: Trading View Additionally, BlackRock’s IBIT has been seeing renewed investor appetite for quite some time too. Even on 24 April, IBIT recorded massive inflows worth $442 million. Needless to say, Blackrock’s success is not just limited to Bitcoin. Even in the case of Ethereum [ETH], Blackrock’s ETHA has been the reason behind the cumulative inflows spot ETH ETFs have been getting. The scale of institutional influx is a sign that market participants may be positioning for another leg up. It also further strengthens the case for a sustained rally in the coming weeks.

Title: Spiritans accused of putting own interests before those of abuse victims

The Spiritan congregation has been accused of putting its own interests, needs and concerns before survivors of abuse in schools run by them. The Restore Together advocacy group for survivors of abuse in Spiritan-run schools has said: “Our experience is that the Spiritans have failed at every stage, from the time of the abuse onwards, to put the interests and rights of victims/survivors first. The Spiritans have invariably put their interests, needs and concerns and those of the institution first.” The accusation is in a lengthy letter written on behalf of the group by survivor Philip Feddis, who attended Blackrock College. Last month it was sent to past pupils’ unions at Blackrock College, Willow Park, St Mary’s College, St Michael’s College and Templeogue College, all in Dublin, and Rockwell College in Co Tipperary. Easter, it said, was “a time for Spiritan priests to reflect on the adequacy of their response to child sex abuse”. The “victim/survivor experience” involving Spiritans was “not one of compassion”, it said. “Victims/survivors feel frustrated, disappointed, angry and worse. The ongoing delay in implementing the comprehensive restorative programme has increased the suffering of victims/survivors in many ways. It is not compassionate, it is cruel.” It pointed out that “a comprehensive, victim-centred redress scheme and a testimony-gathering (truth-telling) project has still not been delivered and the Spiritans have made no commitment to a start date for either. This is completely unacceptable to victims/survivors; most of us are over 60, who have already waited far too long for justice.” [ Spiritans have paid €8.8m in settlements to 125 abuse survivors since 1998Opens in new window ] Because of the age factor, “urgent delivery is vital for the success of these redress and testimony programmes”, the letter said. “A constant refrain is that victims/survivors are tired. We are tired of being ignored and marginalised. We are tired of feeling betrayed and abandoned by institutions that were supposed to protect and care for us as children.” It noted how “Restore Together recently called on the Spiritans to finalise the redress scheme without further delay and have it up and running no later than June 1st this year. The Spiritans have not responded to this call. We in Restore Together have been more than patient.” Survivors, the group said, are “tired of having to fight and push the Spiritans every step of the way to fully and comprehensively face up to the issue of child sex abuse in their schools and `do the right thing’. We are tired of being told we will have to wait.” The “historic power imbalance that we as victims/survivors experienced as children and which facilitated our abuse is still present and underpinning the current situation. This compounds the suffering of victims/survivors and has to be ended for once and for all. The Spiritans must take all immediate steps to bring justice to victims/survivors without having to be pushed every step of the way to do so,” it said.

Title: A county pension fund in Pennsylvania just became the first known to cease purchasing new Tesla stocks

A swing county in Pennsylvania has decided it will no longer purchase new Tesla stock, citing CEO Elon Musk's political activities and the company's declining shares. Lehigh County, which is toward the east of Pennsylvania and has a relatively affluent population, has a county pension board that oversees $500 million in assets. It's the first known US pension fund to stop purchasing new Tesla stock. "Elon Musk's choice to become a political figure rather than a customer-focused leader has compromised the Tesla brand," Mark Pinsley, the Lehigh County controller who first introduced a motion to cease Tesla investments, said in a joint statement with organizers of Tesla Takedown. "Tesla's earnings are down 71% from a year ago, their auto revenues have dropped 20%, and profitability has taken a sharp dive," Pinsley added. "We owe it to our retirees and taxpayers to take a hard look at whether these are wise investments at this time." On Tuesday, the board not only voted to hit the brakes on new Tesla investments in a 4-2 decision, but it also directed the county's investment manager to draft a report outlining options to divest its passively managed funds from Tesla. The Lehigh County Controller's Office and Tesla didn't immediately respond to requests for comments. Pinsley and the retirement board of Lehigh County aren't the only ones concerned about pensions invested in Tesla. In March, a group of 51 New York State legislators called on the state to divest its $1 billion in Tesla holdings. A top contender in the New York City comptroller race has pledged to pull the city's $300 billion pension portfolio out of Tesla if elected. Brad Lander, the current New York City comptroller, has also been vocal about his dissatisfaction with Musk's leadership, but he stopped short of calling for a divestment in his office's latest response to Business Insider in April. The city's five public pension systems held more than 3 million Tesla shares worth about $1.26 billion on December 31, yet this figure had shrunk to $831 million by March 28, according to the comptroller's office. In April, eight state treasurers wrote a joint letter to Tesla's board to express concern over Musk's lack of focus on Tesla, and the American Federation of Teachers is pressing major asset managers — including BlackRock and Vanguard — to consider divestment. Beyond the US border, the Netherlands' largest pension fund offloaded its $600 million stake in Tesla in January. Denmark's $20 billion pension fund, AkademikerPension, followed suit in March. Recently, Canada's largest public-sector union also urged national pension funds to cut ties with Tesla, though divestments have yet to happen. Tesla has been facing growing pressure over Musk's governance of the company and his political activity. The Tesla Takedown movement that emerged in protest of Musk's involvement in the White House DOGE office is looking to evolve beyond demonstrations. The movement's next goal is to help cities and states develop resolutions to divest in "all things Musk," according to a statement on April 22 after Tesla reported earnings. As of Tuesday, Tesla stock has declined more than 27% since the beginning of 2025, and its Q1 revenue missed expectations. Musk announced during the latest earnings call that he would be stepping back from his political activities at the White House. Marketing experts previously told BI that Tesla had alienated its core customer base and that rebranding efforts might require significant concessions from Musk. "To some degree, Musk can say, 'I don't care because I'm so rich and I've got so many other entities that I could afford to lose a lot of money.'" David J. Reibstein, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School, previously told BI. "But for the other shareholders who are bailing on the company, that's problematic." Jump to

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Entrepreneur Grant Cardone is celebrating what he calls the beginning of America’s biggest comeback ever, thanks to President Donald Trump’s push to bring tech manufacturing back to the U.S. Cardone posted on X after Nvidia NVDA CEO Jensen Huang joined Trump at the White House on Wednesday to announce a massive new chip investment. “America is about to have its greatest resurgence in its 250 year history. Thank you President Trump for ‘encouraging' big tech to come home,” Cardone wrote, sharing a video of Huang’s remarks. Don't Miss: Mode Mobile developed a smartphone called EarnPhone, which allows users to earn and save money by playing video games, listening to music and reading the news. With the phone priced at an affordable $99, the barriers to adoption are low. Earning Opportunity for All Smartphone Users Mode EarnPhone State-of-the-art smartphone device includes built-in earning features. EarnOS Proprietary earning software turns smartphones into EarnPhones. During the event, Trump introduced Huang as “the founder, CEO and president of NVIDIA,” and said he was producing up to $500 billion worth of the most powerful AI chips over the next four years—all to be manufactured in the U.S. for the first time ever. Huang said, “NVIDIA reinvented computing for the first time after 60 years,” noting that modern computer design hasn’t changed much since IBM’s System/360 in the 1960s. But the new AI chips are a big leap forward. “That GPU—that’s one GPU unit—it’s 70 pounds, 60,000 parts, 10,000 watts,” Huang said. “Just to test a superchip requires a supercomputer.” Trending: Donald Trump just announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure deal — here's how you can invest in the entertainment market's next big disruptor at $2.25 per share. Huang credited Trump for pushing manufacturing to happen in the U.S. “Without the president’s leadership, his policies, his support, and very importantly, his strong encouragement … manufacturing in the United States wouldn’t have accelerated to this pace,” he said. He emphasized that making these chips isn’t about cheap labor—it’s about advanced tech, robotics, and AI. Nvidia will also use its Omniverse digital twin technology to help build cutting-edge factories on U.S. soil. “This new industry is a manufacturing industry in itself,” Huang said. “We now have the backing of the administration, the backing of President Trump, to support the creation of a whole new industry.” See Also: Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary called Missing Ring his biggest mistake — Don't repeat history—invest in RYSE at just $1.90/share. Huang said the AI infrastructure being built in the U.S. will power breakthroughs in healthcare, financial services, drug discovery, education, and more. “This computer is the engine of a whole new industry,” he said. “Electricity goes into this machine and incredible tokens come out—artificial intelligence.” Nvidia’s partnership with the Trump administration may be shaping up to be a key turning point in bringing high-tech manufacturing back to the U.S., and Cardone believes it could mark the beginning of a historic economic transformation.

Title: U.S. stocks drop on concerns over trade tensions
URL: https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2025/05/07/us-stocks-drop-on-concerns-over-trade-tensions

Wednesday, 07 May 2025 NEW YORK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks closed lower on Tuesday as investors sifted through a wave of corporate earnings while looking ahead to developments on trade talks and the outcome of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, which began earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 389.83 points, or 0.95 percent, to 40,829.00. The S&P 500 dropped 43.47 points, or 0.77 percent, to 5,606.91, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 154.58 points, or 0.87 percent, to finish at 17,689.66. Nine of the eleven S&P 500 sectors ended in negative territory, led by healthcare and consumer discretionary, which declined 2.76 percent and 0.85 percent, respectively. Utilities and energy were the only sectors to post gains, up 1.23 percent and 0.10 percent. Stocks seesawed on Tuesday following a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, their first formal negotiation session since Carney recently took office. During the meeting, Trump dialed back earlier optimism about impending trade agreements, stating bluntly, "We don't have to sign deals." The remark marked a sharp reversal from his Sunday comments, when he suggested multiple deals could be finalized as soon as this week. Investors are now turning their attention to the Federal Reserve, which is not expected to change its benchmark interest rate this week. However, markets are eagerly awaiting Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks on Wednesday, particularly his views on how the Trump administration's tariff policies may be influencing the broader economic outlook. "Despite external pressure to lower rates, the Fed will likely hold strong on the current pause until we see greater clarity on the major economic factors impacting the economy," said Steve Rick, chief economist at TruStage. "As the impacts of tariffs settle in, we still broadly expect the economy to continue to shift towards a slower pace of growth than in recent months." Earnings reports drove notable stock movements on Tuesday. Palantir plunged 12.05 percent, making it the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, despite meeting first-quarter earnings expectations and providing a positive forecast. In contrast, Constellation Energy surged 10.29 percent after beating revenue estimates, fueled by rising electricity demand linked to AI infrastructure growth. Ford Motor gained 2.65 percent after surpassing quarterly profit estimates, though it withdrew its full-year guidance due to tariff-related uncertainty. Mattel also climbed 2.78 percent as it suspended its outlook and announced price hikes in response to tariffs. Large-cap tech stocks, which had recently driven much of the market's rally, faced selling pressure. Tesla and Meta Platforms both declined by about 2 percent, while Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Broadcom, Apple and Nvidia also lost ground. Thank you for your report!

Title: Supermicro Stock Drops as Server Maker Lowers Its Revenue Outlook

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) cut its full-year revenue outlook, sending shares lower in extended trading Tuesday. The server maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner said it now expects fiscal 2025 revenue of $21.8 billion to $22.6 billion, down from its prior range of $23.5 billion to $25 billion. Supermicro shares fell over 6% in after-hours trading following the release. For the fiscal third quarter, Supermicro posted revenue of $4.6 billion, up nearly 20% year-over-year and at the high end of its significantly reduced forecast. Adjusted earnings of 31 cents per share fell from 66 cents per share a year earlier. Supermicro said it anticipates fourth-quarter sales of $5.6 billion to $6.4 billion and adjusted earnings per share of 40 cents to 50 cents. CEO Charles Liang said some Supermicro clients delayed making product decisions during the period, which pushed sales beyond the fiscal third quarter. “We do expect many of those commitments to land in the June and September quarters, reinforcing my confidence in our ability to meet our long-term targets, however economic uncertainty and tariff impacts may have a short-term impact,” Liang said. Supermicro shares have seen significant volatility this year as concerns about the company's accounting practices and delayed filings raised worries it could be delisted from the Nasdaq. The company ultimately met the exchange’s deadline to file its delayed reports in February, but still faces challenges, including uncertainty around how it could be affected by shifting tariff policies.

Title: The 7 Best Diaper Bags, According To Moms Who’ve Tested Over 20 Styles
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/article/best-diaper-bag/
Time Published: 2025-05-06T20:52:55Z
Full Content:
Before I had my first baby, I don’t think I truly understood how many things I would need to carry around with them whenever we left the house. The best diaper bags have the space to stow all those baby essentials like wipes, diapers, bottles, spare clothes, burp cloths and toys. They’re also comfortable and easy for parents to use, so you’re not digging through the diaper bag abyss to find that elusive pacifier. After testing over 20 diaper bags among several testers, we found the Petunia Pickle Bottom Meta Backpack to be the best—it’s made of high-quality materials and has dedicated pockets for all the essentials. Our top value pick, the popular Skip Hop Forma Diaper Bag Backpack, is lightweight, roomy and has remained durable through years of testing. The best diaper bags hold and organize everything you need for your little. Here are all of our winners after testing over 20 diaper bags: When choosing a diaper bag, consider the size and style you want. If you have multiple kids, you may need a larger bag—but be careful not to overload it. Additionally, many parents prefer a backpack or belt bag, so they can have their hands free. “A comfortable, well-designed and ergonomic diaper bag that meets your specific needs can improve quality of life as you navigate the daily demands of motherhood,” says Amy McCormick, an occupational therapist who leads the postpartum rehabilitation program at UNC Rex Holly Springs Hospital in North Carolina. Continue reading for an in-depth look at all of our top picks for the best diaper bags along with more information on our testing process and what to look for when you’re shopping for a diaper bag. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 13.4 x 6.7 x 13.8 inches | Weight: 1.3 pounds | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: A 100% guarantee on hardware and fabric defects for two years | Cleaning instructions: Wipe down Best for: Skip if: With 10 total pockets, the Petunia Pickle Bottom Meta Backpack makes it simple to find a spot for all your baby items and then some. From a discreet felt-lined electronics pocket to stretchy diaper pockets and an insulated bottle pocket, there’s a place to put everything. The large main compartment zippers all the way down, which helps with packing the bag and finding things that may have fallen to the bottom. A strap on the back that attaches to rolling luggage makes it a great option for travel, too. It’s also the lightest diaper bag backpack that we tested. The Petunia Pickle Bottom Meta Backpack is just the right size for essentials. Many of the more stylish diaper bags I’ve tested are either uncomfortable or have fabrics that are difficult to maintain and clean. That isn’t the case with this bag. Depending on the style you choose, the outer material is either vegan leather, coated canvas or vegan leather with cable-stitch textured embossing. The styles are classic and professional, making this a good option to bring to work if you’re pumping or simply want to continue to use the bag after your baby is older. Though the bag isn’t machine washable, the materials are easy to wipe clean. Our tester intentionally spilled a blueberry pouch on the bag and left it to sit overnight. In the morning, it wiped up effortlessly. The included changing pad is machine washable, so there’s no need to worry about messy diaper changes. The comfort of this bag is a huge plus, too. It’s a backpack-style bag, which many of our experts recommend. The padded straps are nice and comfortable. “When worn properly, with both straps well positioned, [backpack bags] can help minimize risk of injury and reduce stress on the back, abdominals, and pelvic floor,” says McCormick., Though I laud the bag for its ample pockets, you can’t pack quite as much in this bag as some of our other top picks, like the Skip Hop Forma or the Béis Backpack Diaper Bag. When I try to put too many things in the bag, it becomes lumpy and awkward because there isn’t much give to the material. Our tester also found that the side water bottle pocket was difficult to pack when there were too many things in the main compartment. However, that limit on space is a good thing in some ways. “More space just means more stuff crammed inside—and trust us, you don’t need to carry everything but the kitchen sink,” says Laura Hunter, a licensed practical nurse and cofounder of Moms on Call, a parenting resource brand. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 16 x 8 x 14 inches | Weight: 1.4 pounds | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: Limited warranty | Cleaning instructions: Wipe down Best for: Skip if: The value of the Skip Hop Forma Diaper Bag Backpack is unmatched. My husband and I have used it as our main diaper bag for over five years, and it’s still in excellent shape. The bag has two padded straps and it’s a backpack bag, making it the ideal ergonomic option. Because it’s a backpack bag that’s incredibly lightweight, this is a good option for parents have back problems or moms who may struggle with core strength, pelvic floor strength or who are recovering from a c-section or tear. “Postpartum moms should consider their core and pelvic health when choosing a diaper bag. After a vaginal birth, weakened pelvic floor muscles and potential back pain mean a lightweight, evenly distributed bag (like a backpack style) is ideal to reduce strain. For c-section recovery, avoiding heavy shoulder bags that put pressure on healing abdominal muscles is crucial,” says John Gallucci Jr., a doctor of physical therapy and CEO of New York-based Jag Physical Therapy. The Skip Hop Forma is a great value option that's durable and easy to pack. I like packing this bag more than some of the more stylish or boxy bags because the material has some give to it. There are nine total pockets, plus two packing cubes. Pockets include two bottle pockets, a main compartment, two stretchy interior pockets, two front zipper pockets and more. The bag also comes with a changing pad. The side bottle pockets have plenty of room to hold water bottles for parents and caregivers or babies. The storage cubes are great for packing things on-the-go, too. If I want to leave the larger diaper bag in the car, I can put a bottle, diaper and some wipes in a packing cube and significantly lighten my load. McCormick likes the option of using removable storage cubes, too, as they make it easy to add and remove items based on the specific outing or activity. The fabric is water-repellent, and our tester found it easy to clean a spilled baby food pouch and water. In addition to being able to wipe down any spills, I’ve also found that it’s easy to clean out crumbs and messes at the bottom of the bag because the fabric has enough flexibility to it that I can turn the bag inside out. Dagne Dover Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 9.5 x 5.6 x 12.3 inches (small), 11.8 x 6.5 x 12.8 inches (medium, 12.3 x 7 x 13.8 (large) | Weight: 3 pounds (small), 3.5 pounds (medium), 4 pounds (large)| Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: Limited guarantee for 1 year | Cleaning instructions: Hand wash Best for: Skip if: The Dagne Dover Indi Diaper Backpack comes in small, medium and large sizes, so parents can find the right option for their carrying style. In addition to the many interior and exterior pockets, including a wipes and insulated bottle holder, it also comes with extras like a storage pouch and a shoe bag. A luggage sleeve on the back makes this a good option for travel, too. Other extras include a changing mat and stroller clips, though we don’t recommend using stroller clips due to the potential danger of tipping the stroller. If you tend to overpack your bag, you might want to get the size larger than you think you’ll need. Our tester found that when she had the main compartment of the bag packed full, it was difficult to use the exterior zipper pockets. The fabric on the Dagne Dover Indi is so comfortable and soft. Many people love the look and feel of the Indi. The neoprene material is 100% vegan, and it’s available in a variety of aesthetic colors, some of which are gender-neutral. From the outside, it looks more like a regular backpack than a diaper bag. The fabric is soft, not stiff, and the nicely padded straps make it comfortable to wear. Our tester found that the fabric stretches easily to accommodate items that you throw in the bag. If you (or your kids) tend to spill things a lot, this may not be the best bag for you. When our tester spilled water and a tot food pouch on the bag, it initially cleaned up well, but in the long-term, she found some stains lingered on her camel-colored bag. Béis Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 12 x 7.75 x 15 inches | Weight: 4 pounds | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: 45-day return policy | Cleaning instructions: Wipe down Best for: Skip if: Some people like to overstuff their diaper bag (guilty as charged). Whether you’re packing for twins like me or just need extra space, the Béis Backpack Diaper Bag gives you the room you need. The top of the bag opens wide so you can pack and find the things you need, and there are a good number of pockets. Our tester found that the exterior bottle pockets were large enough to hold her water bottles, which wasn’t the case with every bag she tested. Inside, you can tighten the insulated bottle pouch so your baby’s bottle doesn’t get lost in the main compartment. Because it’s such a big bag and it already weighs 4 pounds, be careful not to overpack it. “Extremely large or heavy bags may encourage overpacking, making it hard to reach items and adding unnecessary strain to the back, abdominals and pelvic floor,” says McCormick. Though the bag can get heavy if you stuff too much in it, our tester found it comfortable with nicely padded straps. My favorite thing about the Béis Backpack Diaper Bag is that it’s obvious it was thoroughly designed with babies and parents in mind. The included changing pad has a pouch to store diapers, wipes or diaper rash cream. In the bag, you’ll find a pacifier pouch and a teething ring. There is also an odor-proof pouch, which is ideal for storing soiled clothes or for parents who use cloth diapers to store dirty diapers until they get home. Another included extra is stroller clips, though we do not recommend using these as the weight of the bag can tip your stroller. Our tester loved all of these extras as well as how easy the bag is to clean. The stain-resistant fabric can be wiped down. She had no problem cleaning up the food pouch that she intentionally spilled on the bag. The high-quality and easy-to-clean material makes this a great pick for families with multiple kids or those who want a durable bag that can stand up to extensive everyday use. Caraa Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 12.3 x 12 x 5 inches (medium), 13 x 12.8 x 5.8 (large) | Weight: 2.5 pounds (medium), 3 pounds (large) | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: 21 day return period, manufacturing defects are assessed on a case by case basis | Cleaning instructions: Machine washable (black), clean with mild neutral soap mixed with warm water and a clean microfiber cloth (all other colors) Best for: Skip if: Becoming a parent doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice your style or your love for luxury products. The Caraa Baby Bag is made with parent and baby in mind, with so many thoughtful features. Forbes Vetted editor Margaret Badore found that this bag had the best features of all the high-end bags she tested. She particularly likes the hot/cold pocket and the fully removable diaper caddy. The caddy has four pockets for storing wipes, diapers and other essentials, and it’s a helpful feature for packing a few things on the go. “The removable organizer is also extremely useful; when packed with diaper change essentials, I could take just that part out and head to the bathroom with baby for a change,” says Badore. Unfortunately, the bag does not come with a changing pad to complement the diaper caddy. One of my favorite baby-friendly features: the black version of the bag is machine washable, which isn’t a common feature in diaper bags. No matter the spill, you can throw it in the wash for quick cleanup. For other color options, you need to clean with mild neutral soap mixed with warm water and a clean microfiber cloth to maintain the color. The Caraa Baby Bag can be worn as a backpack or a cross-body bag. The bag is available in a medium or large size, and the versatility is key. You can choose to wear the bag as a backpack or as a crossbody bag by attaching a shoulder strap. When you wear it this way, you can tuck the backpack straps out of the way. The bag also comes with stroller hooks, but we don’t recommend using them because hanging a bag on your stroller can cause it to tip. This bag has so many pockets. From insulated bottle pockets to a phone pocket to hot/cold pockets and pockets with magnetic closures, you’ll certainly find a spot to put everything. When you’re traveling, simply slide the bag onto your luggage with the attached luggage sleeve. Badore has used this bag for about two years, including on family trips and as a carry-on, and has found virtually no signs of wear. The profile of this bag is a bit wider than many others, so that’s something to consider if you need your bag to fit into a compact area. State Bags Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 16.5 x 13 x 5.9 inches | Weight: 1.9 pounds | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: 1 year for material or manufacturing defects | Cleaning instructions: Spot clean with a damp cloth Best for: Skip if: A gender neutral diaper bag is ideal if you’ll be sharing the bag with other caregivers—or perhaps you simply prefer that look and style. From the outside, the State Lorimer Diaper Bag doesn’t scream diaper bag, and it’s available in five colors, including the several gender-neutral picks like an olive, black and navy. You can personalize the bag with up to three characters and two symbols or patches. The padded straps are nice, and Badore found the bag comfortable even when it was loaded up. When traveling, you can also attach the bag to your luggage with a built-in luggage slip. The fabric is easy to clean. In our tests, water ran right off the nylon parts, and our spilled pouch wiped up no problem. Badore appreciates all of the pockets in this bag, which include two main compartments, a front zipper pocket, side water bottle pockets, an insulated bottle pocket and more. With so many places to put things, it’s less likely you’ll lose something at the bottom of the bag. It also includes a washable changing pad and a padded laptop sleeve that fits laptops up to 15 inches. For parents who sometimes have to work while taking care of their kids, this can be a huge plus. Though there is plenty of room for all of the essentials, the large size of this bag could encourage you to pack too much, which could put extra stain on your back. This can also be dangerous if you use the attached stroller clips as a heavy diaper bag could tip a stroller. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 6.5 x 7 x 4 inches | Weight: 2 pounds | Bag style: Belt bag | Warranty: Limited warranty for 1 year | Cleaning instructions: Machine washable Best for: Skip if: I really couldn’t ask for much more in a compact diaper bag. The Colugo On-The-Go Organizer is sleek, comfortable and highly adjustable. According to Hunter, small and compact is the way to go. “Moms on Call recommends smaller, well-organized bags that keep only the essentials at your fingertips. Some other features we can do without,” she says. The bag has enough room for the basics like diapers and wipes. It has six pockets plus two bottle holders, so you can keep your items organized, too. Our tester was surprised at how many things she could fit in the bag. It also had room for her son’s sweatshirt. The Colugo On The Go Organizer is ideal for staying hands-free while carrying all the essentials. My favorite thing about this bag is that it can double as a stroller organizer. While hanging larger, heavier bags from a stroller is unsafe due to the potential for tipping, I don’t worry about that with such a small bag. In fact, the bag is designed to be a stroller organizer first, diaper bag second. It’s nice to be able to just grab the bag and go when you need to park your stroller or leave it somewhere unattended. The versatility makes the price just right, too. You’re getting two products in one. I appreciate machine-washable diaper bags like this one, because with three kids, sometimes I don’t realize a spill happened until well after the fact. It wipes down easily, too. Our tester spilled the majority of a water bottle in the bag and found that it dried easily and didn’t get things stored in other pockets wet. The bag is simple to adjust and comfortable. I don’t have to fiddle with the straps too much to get them where I want them. Other crossbody or belt bags that I’ve tested feel too boxy or bulky, but I didn’t find that with this one. The strap also has a pretty wide range, meaning it can work for caregivers of various sizes. Over several years, we’ve tested more than 20 diaper bags among three mom testers. We included our favorites in the guide and continue to test additional bags as they become available. Here are the others we’ve tested: Freshly Picked Classic Diaper Bag: I’ve had this bag for years, and I really like the style and look of it. However, it’s pretty boxy, and it doesn’t offer as many organization options as other bags. Another tester also found that it started to fray almost immediately, which made us question the high price tag. BabbleRoo Diaper Bag Backpack: This is a budget-friendly diaper bag that is available in many colors and styles. It also has a lot of useful pockets, like a pacifier pouch and three insulated bottle pockets. It wasn’t as comfortable as some of the other bags we tested, and our tester found it difficult to pack the bag with everything she needed. Ruvalino Diaper Bag Backpack: This popular bag is well-loved for its low price. However, it’s somewhat bulky and stiff. It was also a bit more difficult to clean than many other bags we tested. We enjoyed the variety of pockets and were able to pack a lot into the bag. Herschel Baby Strand Sprout Shoulder Bag: Though this is more of a minimalistic bag, there is plenty of space inside. Our tester really liked the included changing pad. Unfortunately, it lacks many of the features of our top picks and our tester wasn’t able to find a comfortable way to carry the bag. Eddie Bauer Cascade Back Pack Diaper Bag: There are plenty of features packed into this diaper bag like a wipes pocket, insulated bottle pocket and changing pad. However, it’s not as user-friendly as we’d like. It can be difficult to reach the bottom of the main compartment and our tester found that the diaper pockets weren’t wide enough. Béis The Diaper Pack: This bag has some nice features like a changing pad and a convenient wipes pocket. It’s also pretty spacious for a belt bag. However, I found it too boxy and bulky. The main dealbreaker was that when worn as a belt bag, I couldn’t get the straps small enough. Parents and caregivers with slim frames may struggle to get the bag tight enough to stay on. Dagne Dover Ace: Those searching for something extra minimalistic might like this fanny pack diaper bag—but it just didn’t have enough features or space for us. Storq Quick Change Fanny Pack : Though this bag is a good size for a belt bag, it doesn’t have the organization features necessary to store the amount of baby gear you can fit in a bag. We like that it’s lightweight and machine washable. Ditty Co. Small Diaper Bag: This belt bag is comfortable and machine washable with an affordable price that matches it size. It might work for some families who prefer to pack light, but we wanted more space. Luli Baby Monaco Sling Bag: This sling bag has nice features given its smaller package, such as a pacifier holder and a phone pocket. It’s more complicated to adjust and get items out of than other bags we tested, though, and when you’re juggling babies and all their things, you don’t want a bag that makes things more difficult. State Jordan Diaper Bag: We were able to fit plenty of things in this bag and liked the organizing pouches and changing pad. However, we didn’t find the shoulder strap very comfortable, especially when compared to backpack style diaper bags. BagSmart Walker 25L Featherlight Travel Diaper Backpack: There are a lot of features in this bag that we appreciated, like the large insulated bottle pocket and the waterproof laundry pouch. What our tester didn’t like was that many of these features don’t quite work the way they should. For example, the insulated bottle pouch didn’t fit many popular bottle brands, and it was hard to get diapers to fit into the diaper pouches. JuJuBe B.F.F. Diaper Bag: You can wear this bag as a backpack, messenger bag or shoulder bag—but our tester didn’t find it comfortable to wear, and it wasn’t quite big enough to fit all of our supplies. We also tested the Petunia Pickle Bottom Mini Bag and the Kibou Fanny Pack Diaper Bag. The Petunia Pickle Bottom Mini Bag is no longer in stock, and though the Kibou Fanny Pack Diaper Bag was our previous pick for the best diaper belt bag, the bag has since been discontinued. What we’re testing next: We’re continuing to test two No Reception bags, two Calpak diaper bags, including the Calpak Diaper Backpack With Laptop Sleeve, and plan to consider the new Away diaper bag collection as well as Uppababy’s Changing Backpack, among others. We’ve spent years testing diaper bags and between myself and two other testers, we’ve tested over 20 bags. For this round of testing in 2025, myself and baby and kids gear editor Margaret Badore tested a combined 11 bags, and some bags have been tested by multiple families. We tested the diaper bags in real-world situations, like daycare drop-offs, family outings and trips to the pediatrician’s office. Here’s a peek at what we looked for when we tested bags: The best diaper bags make it easier for you to get out and about with your kids. Here are some factors to consider when shopping for a diaper bag. The three most common types of diaper bags are backpack, fanny pack or belt bags and shoulder or tote bags. Many parents and caregivers want a diaper bag that fits their style as it can become an extension of themselves for quite a few years. Don’t forget to consider the preferences of your partner or other caregivers, too. While you might love a stylish floral print bag, another caregiver you’ll be sharing the bag with might not. Ergonomics are incredibly important, particularly for new moms. After delivery, moms might face weakened abdominal muscles and a weakened pelvic floor. They might also be recovering from a c-section or a perineal tear. For any parent or caregiver, an ergonomic diaper bag can help reduce the risk of developing back, neck and shoulder pain. Some ergonomic features to look for include wide, padded backpack straps that allow you to evenly distribute weight, structured bags that maintain their shape while wearing them and adjustable straps. Choosing a lightweight bag and limiting how much you pack can be beneficial, too. “It’s important that all moms choose a diaper bag that is lightweight and adjustable to safely distribute weight and support healing of the pelvic floor and abdominals that are often compromised from the strain endured during both pregnancy and childbirth,” says McCormick. “Moms experiencing postural changes or diastasis recti should prioritize ergonomic designs that prevent excessive forward hunching,” adds Gallucci. “Ultimately, a well-balanced, adjustable bag can help reduce discomfort and support postpartum recovery.” Diaper bags can have many features. Some helpful ones include insulated pockets, changing pads, diaper pockets, wipe pockets, device pockets, storage cubes or pouches and clips for keys and toys. “Durable and easy-to-clean materials can hold up to everyday use, make messes quick to resolve with less stress, and prevent caregiver fatigue by allowing the bag to be set down without concern for damage,” says McCormick. While some bags are machine washable, most are water-resistant and can be wiped clean. I’m a parenting writer, product tester and mom to three, and I cover baby and kids gear for Forbes Vetted. I’ve been testing baby, kids and parenting products for seven years, and I’ve tested many diaper bags on this list, some of which I’ve used for years. I test a wide range of products, from the best toys for 6-month-olds to the best strollers. In addition to testing products for this article, I also spoke to other parents and testers about which diaper bags they liked, conducted in-depth research, compared features of the diaper bags and interviewed four experts. Those experts include: At its core, a diaper bag is simply a place to carry baby essentials while you’re out and about. You can use a purse, backpack or any other type of bag as a diaper bag. However, many diaper bags have convenient features such as insulated bottle pockets, wipes pouches and elastic diaper storage pockets. They’re designed to carry all your baby essentials and often come with built-in changing pads, too. Prices of diaper bags can range from around $20 to over $200. Many durable and comfortable diaper bags fall in the $75 to $100 range. You might pay a bit more for something that’s more stylish or made of higher-end materials. When it comes to a diaper bag, the lighter, the better. As you add more things into the bag, it can get heavy, causing back and neck strain. Most diaper bags are 4 pounds or less with some belt bags weighing under a pound.

ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(Millions except per share amounts and percentages) (Unaudited) ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(Millions) ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS(Millions) (Unaudited) ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.SELECTED CORPORATE DATA(Millions) (Unaudited) (1) The Company operates as three operating segments, Data Center, Client and Gaming, and Embedded segments.The Data Center segment primarily includes Artificial Intelligence (AI) accelerators, server microprocessors (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), accelerated processing units (APUs), data processing units (DPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Smart Network Interface Cards (SmartNICs) and Adaptive System-on-Chip (SoC) products for data centers.The Client and Gaming segment primarily includes CPUs, APUs, and chipsets for desktops and notebooks, and discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and development services.The Embedded segment primarily includes embedded CPUs, GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, System on Modules (SOMs), and Adaptive SoC products. From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio. All Other category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the operating segments, such as amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, employee stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, inventory loss at contract manufacturer and restructuring charges. (2) Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA The Company presents “Adjusted EBITDA” as a supplemental measure of its performance. Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting GAAP net income for interest expense, other (income) expense, net, income tax provision (benefit), equity income in investee, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, inventory loss at contract manufacturer, acquisition-related and other costs, and restructuring charges. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of net income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows. (3) Reconciliation of GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by operating activities for capital expenditures, and free cash flow margin % is free cash flow expressed as a percentage of the Company's net revenue. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities.

Title: $330B Bitcoin Corporate Surge? Why BTC Bull Token Could Be Poised to Benefit
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/330b-bitcoin-corporate-surge-btc-bull-token-to-benefit/
Time Published: 2025-05-06T20:00:07Z
Full Content:
Bernstein predicts that corporate treasuries could hold $330B worth of Bitcoin by 2029. That prediction indicates an ongoing change of heart from Wall Street — and could prime BTC Bull token to explode in 2025. Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, used to be a Bitcoin critic. Now, Blackrock offers $IBIT, the largest Bitcoin ETF on the market, controlling $55B of the $116B Spot Bitcoin AUM (assets under management). Bernstein’s latest report projects a staggering $330B in corporate Bitcoin holdings by 2029, a figure that underscores the growing role of $BTC in mainstream finance. According to Bernstein’s research, companies worldwide could allocate up to 5% of their treasuries to Bitcoin by 2029, translating to an estimated $330 billion inflow. That trajectory – Bitcoin as a strategic asset, rather than just another kind of tech stock – marks a dramatic turnaround. If sovereign wealth funds sink 3-5% of their assets into Bitcoin, the crypto’s price could reach astronomically high levels; $700K, per an earlier Fink prediction. The question remains: are funds buying Bitcoin? Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) certainly is. It continues to amass Bitcoin at a prodigious rate. After snapping up another 1,800+ Bitcoin, the company holds 555,450 $BTC. There will eventually be only 21M Bitcoin, so Strategy already holds a little over 1 out of every 42 potential tokens. Put another way, the stated goal of the US Bitcoin Treasury is to purchase 1M Bitcoin. Saylor’s already halfway there by himself. Strategy’s stock has grown 2,476% since buying its first Bitcoin in August 2020, validating Saylor’s increasingly aggressive approach to purchasing Bitcoin. The key to Bitcoin’s success will be if it continues to decouple from equities. And if Bitcoin gets even close to that $700K mark, then another group of crypto investors will have already made huge gains – anyone who owns BTC Bull token, one of the best crypto to buy now. How can average investors compete with institutions that can drop billions into Bitcoin treasuries? With BTC Bull token ($BTCBULL), there’s a way. $BTCBULL is designed to give everyday crypto enthusiasts leveraged exposure to Bitcoin’s market movements, without the complexity of managing futures or options. $BTCBULL uses two simple tokenomics tools to tie $BTCBULL’s performance to Bitcoin’s growth. Both tools are triggered whenever Bitcoin reaches key price milestones. Those milestones occur every time Bitcoin’s price reaches an all-time high, in $25K increments up to $250K. Of course, if Bernstein’s prediction is correct, then the team behind BTC Bull might have severely undershot with their project’s goals. Regardless, $BTCBULL token holders gain three ways to earn from the project: The project has already raised $5.3M, with a current token price of $0.0025. Our analysis shows that the token price could reach $0.06467 by the end of the year, with the potential for even greater gains if Bitcoin accelerates rapidly. Learn how to buy BTC Bull token, and visit the presale page today. As institutional Bitcoin adoption grows, retail investors seek vehicles that maximize their upside potential. $BTCBULL is perfectly positioned to fill that gap, offering amplified returns tied directly to Bitcoin’s price movements. And the better Bitcoin does, the better the outlook for the best altcoins, which will also benefit from market momentum. Always do your own research. This is not financial advice, and the crypto market remains highly volatile. With bullish momentum across the market and growing mainstream acceptance, projects like BTCBULL could become key players for traders aiming to capitalize on Bitcoin’s next growth cycle.

Title: What Is VTSAX and How Does It Work? A Beginner’s Guide

Time Published: 2025-05-06T19:03:48Z

If you’ve been researching investment options for building long-term wealth, chances are you’ve come across the term “VTSAX.” It’s one of the most recommended mutual funds among financial experts and personal finance communities. But what exactly is VTSAX, how does it work, and is it the right investment for you? In this comprehensive guide, we break down everything you need to know about VTSAX in simple terms. Whether you’re a beginner or just looking to understand this fund better, this article is designed to help you make an informed investment decision. Contents VTSAX stands for Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Admiral Shares. It is a low-cost mutual fund offered by Vanguard, one of the largest investment companies in the world. VTSAX is designed to give investors exposure to the entire U.S. stock market in a single investment. This means that when you invest in VTSAX, you own a tiny piece of over 4,000 publicly traded U.S. companies – from large corporations like Apple and Microsoft to small-cap stocks you’ve probably never heard of. The popularity of VTSAX boils down to a few key benefits: VTSAX uses a passive investing strategy. It aims to mirror the performance of the CRSP US Total Market Index, which includes nearly all U.S. stocks across various sectors and market capitalizations (large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, and micro-cap). Instead of trying to beat the market like actively managed funds do, VTSAX simply tracks it. This strategy leads to lower trading costs, minimal turnover, and greater tax efficiency. VTSAX holds thousands of companies across a wide range of industries. Some of the top holdings include: These top holdings typically make up a larger percentage of the fund due to their market capitalization. Many investors compare VTSAX vs VTI because both offer exposure to the total U.S. stock market.

LipoJaro Ingredients Breakdown Exploring the Natural Compounds That Power LipoJaro LipoJaro’s formula is built on a blend of natural ingredients selected to support the body’s fat metabolism, appetite regulation, and digestive balance—without the use of stimulants. This focus aligns with 2025’s clean-label movement and the shift toward non-GMO, plant-based supplements for weight management. Below is a closer look at each of the key ingredients in LipoJaro and how they may contribute to a more sustainable wellness routine. While individual results will vary, the inclusion of these compounds is grounded in a combination of traditional use and emerging scientific research. Disclaimer: The following ingredient descriptions are for informational purposes only and are not intended to diagnose, treat, or prevent any disease. Consult your healthcare provider before beginning any supplement. Glucomannan Glucomannan is a water-soluble dietary fiber derived from the root of the konjac plant. Once ingested, it expands in the stomach by absorbing water, which may create a sensation of fullness and reduce overall calorie intake. Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) CLA is a type of fatty acid found in meat and dairy products, though LipoJaro uses a plant-derived version. CLA has been studied for its potential to promote fat oxidation and preserve lean body mass. Green Tea Extract Green tea extract contains catechins—especially EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate)—that are associated with fat-burning and antioxidant support. Garcinia Cambogia Derived from a tropical fruit, garcinia cambogia contains hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which has been explored for its potential role in suppressing appetite and reducing fat storage. Chromium Chromium is a trace mineral that may play a role in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Black Pepper Extract (BioPerine®) Black pepper extract is often added to enhance nutrient absorption. It improves bioavailability, making other ingredients in the formula more effective. Additional Botanicals and Synergistic Compounds While the primary ingredients carry most of the functional benefits, LipoJaro may also include supportive compounds such as: These additions are designed to round out the supplement and enhance its total impact over time. Designed for Ingredient Transparency LipoJaro’s formulation avoids artificial additives, preservatives, and synthetic fillers. Each capsule reflects the brand’s focus on quality, third-party testing, and manufacturing in GMP-certified facilities. Disclaimer: Effects are not guaranteed and may vary depending on the individual. Always verify ingredient labels for allergies or contraindications. No more jitters. Just results. Shop LipoJaro today and start your journey to better appetite control and metabolism—risk-free for 60 days! Reported Side Effects and Safety Considerations What to Know Before Starting LipoJaro While LipoJaro is marketed as a non-stimulant, natural weight management supplement, understanding its potential side effects and overall safety profile is important for informed use. Based on the formulation and user-reported feedback, most individuals tolerate the product well when taken as directed. That said, it's essential to explore how the body might initially respond to the active compounds, especially for first-time users or those with underlying health conditions. LipoJaro is formulated without common stimulants like caffeine or synephrine, which are often responsible for jitteriness, rapid heart rate, or sleep disturbances in traditional fat burners. Instead, it relies on a combination of fiber-rich and fat metabolism-supportive ingredients such as glucomannan, green tea extract, and CLA. These are generally considered gentle on the system, but they may cause mild digestive changes for some users during the adjustment period. Possible Mild Reactions Reported by Users Some individuals may experience: These effects are typically transient and tend to subside after the first few days of consistent use. Drinking adequate water when taking LipoJaro is essential for optimal fiber expansion and to prevent gastrointestinal discomfort. Disclaimer: These potential side effects are not experienced by everyone. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional before beginning any new supplement, especially if you are pregnant, nursing, have a medical condition, or are taking prescription medications. Who Should Avoid Taking LipoJaro? Although LipoJaro is generally well-tolerated, there are cases where it may not be advisable. It may not be appropriate for individuals who: Because the supplement works partly by expanding in the stomach to help control appetite, it’simportant to take it with at least 8 oz of water. Taking it dry or without adequate hydration could result in discomfort or choking risk. A Clean-Label Alternative for Sensitive Users Compared to many over-the-counter weight loss products, LipoJaro offers a gentler approach—free of synthetic stimulants, harsh laxatives, or artificial colors and preservatives. This makes it appealing to those who have experienced side effects from stimulant-heavy formulas in the past or who prefer a cleaner supplement experience. As with any supplement, the best approach is to start slowly, listen to your body, and maintain open communication with a healthcare provider. LipoJaro's formula is designed for daily use, but it’s always smart to monitor how it fits into your personal health routine. Ready to ditch the crash diets?

Real User Results: What People Are Saying A Closer Look at the Lived Experience Behind the Label When evaluating a supplement like LipoJaro, it's not enough to simply review the ingredient list—real-world feedback from actual users offers some of the most valuable insight into what the product can or cannot do. Many people considering a non-stimulant fat burner want to know: Does LipoJaro actually work? What kinds of results can I expect? Are users satisfied with their outcomes? Across public reviews, feedback platforms, and testimonials shared on the official website, user impressions of LipoJaro show a mix of positive momentum and realistic expectations. While individual results vary, many users report benefits such as improved portion control, reduced cravings, more balanced energy levels, and modest but noticeable body composition changes when paired with healthy habits. Reported Positive Outcomes Common positive experiences include: For some individuals, the impact was not dramatic in the first few days, but became more noticeable with consistent use over two to three weeks. This gradual shift aligns with the supplement's intended purpose—supporting long-term metabolic and appetite regulation rather than forcing aggressive short-term weight loss. “After struggling with portion control for years, I finally feel like I’m in charge of my hunger instead of the other way around. LipoJaro made a big difference for me.” — Verified User Review “I wanted something without caffeine or jittery side effects. LipoJaro didn’t give me a quick fix, but it helped me stay consistent and avoid the late-night snacking that always ruined my progress.” — Verified Buyer Experience Realistic Expectations and Moderate Feedback While many users express satisfaction, some note that LipoJaro did not deliver drastic results on its own, especially without any dietary or exercise adjustments. A few reviewers mention needing to increase their water intake or adjust meal timing to better coordinate with the supplement. Others express the desire for quicker visual results, though they acknowledge the formula's stimulant-free nature and emphasis on sustainability over speed. Key Takeaways from User Feedback Disclaimer: Testimonials reflect individual experiences and are not guarantees of specific results. Supplement effects vary based on individual physiology, activity levels, and adherence to a healthy lifestyle. By analyzing user responses, it becomes clear that LipoJaro is built more for reliability and balance than extreme fat loss. Those looking for a clean-label, stimulant-free addition to their routine may find it a helpful tool on the journey to better metabolic health. Your metabolism deserves better.

Common Complaints and How They’re Handled Addressing the Concerns Behind the Feedback While many LipoJaro users report positive experiences, it’s important to acknowledge and evaluate the most common concerns shared by customers. A transparent supplement review doesn’t just highlight benefits—it also takes into account areas where users may have encountered friction or unmet expectations. Like any widely distributed wellness product, LipoJaro receives a range of feedback. Most complaints are not about the formulation itself but revolve around order fulfillment, expectations for rapid results, or communication with customer service. Understanding these concerns—and how the company addresses them—can help potential buyers make a more informed decision. Most Frequently Reported Complaints Disclaimer: Experiences vary by customer. For all support issues, it’s best to retain order confirmation emails and communicate directly with the official support team to ensure accurate service. How LipoJaro’s Brand Responds LipoJaro’s website features a clear returns policy and states a 60-day satisfaction guarantee. To back this, they provide a dedicated customer service email to handle refund requests, product inquiries, and shipping updates. While this policy is in place, like any supplement company, response times can fluctuate based on volume. The company also encourages buyers to use the product consistently for at least 30 days before judging its effectiveness—especially because it is not formulated with fast-acting synthetic stimulants that might mask true metabolic shifts. Transparent Business Practices Matter Although no product is universally loved, a brand’s willingness to address concerns head-on and stand by its refund policy reflects positively on its business model. Customers are encouraged to review all terms of service, usage instructions, and return guidelines before purchasing. Disclaimer: Always refer to the official website for the latest return policy, terms of use, and customer service contact information. Business policies are subject to change. Who Should Consider LipoJaro? Identifying the Ideal User Profile LipoJaro is designed for individuals seeking support in managing weight-related challenges using a non-stimulant, plant-based approach. While it is not a substitute for a healthy lifestyle, it may offer meaningful support for people who struggle with appetite control, cravings, and slow metabolism—especially those looking to avoid harsh ingredients or quick-fix gimmicks. Based on the ingredients and reported effects, LipoJaro may be a good fit for the following groups: Why the Stimulant-Free Approach Appeals to a Broader Audience Many people avoid traditional fat burners due to side effects such as anxiety, heart palpitations, or disrupted sleep. LipoJaro’snon-stimulant formula allows for daily use without triggering the nervous system or interfering with natural energy cycles. This makes it an attractive option for those seeking gentle, sustainable weight management rather than short-term energy spikes. Additionally, the inclusion of fiber-based ingredients like glucomannan and digestion-enhancing compounds such as black pepper extract can appeal to people dealing with bloating, irregularity, or sluggish digestion—factors that can all contribute to weight retention. Disclaimer: LipoJaro is not intended for individuals under 18, those with swallowing difficulties, or anyone diagnosed with a medical condition without physician approval. Always speak with a qualified healthcare provider before beginning any new dietary supplement. Who Might Not Benefit While LipoJaro is formulated to be accessible and well-tolerated, it may not suit everyone. Individuals expecting rapid fat loss, or those who are not committed to making lifestyle adjustments alongside supplement use, may not achieve optimal outcomes. Similarly, anyone requiring a medically supervised weight loss program should not use over-the-counter supplements without direct approval from a medical professional. Supporting the Right Expectations LipoJaro works best as a complement to balanced nutrition, hydration, and movement. It is not a magic bullet, but rather a support tool for those who are ready to improve consistency and reduce self-sabotaging habits like emotional eating or erratic hunger patterns. When used as directed, it may help users feel more in control of their eating, experience gradual improvements in body composition, and support their long-term weight wellness goals. Natural weight loss starts here—LipoJaro is trusted by thousands. Shop today for powerful appetite support with no side effects! How to Use LipoJaro for Maximum Benefit Following the Suggested Routine for Effective Results To get the most from any dietary supplement—especially one designed for non-stimulant metabolic support—consistency and proper timing matter. LipoJaro is formulated with ingredients like glucomannan, CLA, and green tea extract that work best when taken regularly and in conjunction with balanced lifestyle habits. According to the manufacturer, the recommended usage is to take two capsules per day, ideally 30 minutes before your two largest meals of the day, such as breakfast and lunch. This allows the ingredients to interact with food intake and support satiety before eating begins. Taking the capsules with at least 8 ounces of water is essential, particularly because glucomannan expands in the stomach to promote a sense of fullness. This hydration step is critical—not just for effectiveness, but for safety. Disclaimer: Never take LipoJaro dry or without sufficient water, as this could pose a choking hazard. Individuals with difficulty swallowing should not use this product. Tips for Integrating LipoJaro Into Your Daily Routine To optimize your experience with LipoJaro, consider the following best practices: What to Avoid While Taking LipoJaro Although LipoJaro is generally well-tolerated, it may be best to avoid pairing it with other fiber-heavy products or additional appetite suppressants without guidance from a healthcare provider. Overdoing fiber can lead to bloating or discomfort, especially if not spaced out properly. Additionally, combining LipoJaro with stimulant-based fat burners could be redundant and may offset its balanced, gentle effects. Disclaimer: Always read ingredient labels when combining supplements. If you are currently using other weight management products, consult a healthcare professional before adding LipoJaro to your routine. A Support Tool, Not a Standalone Solution LipoJaro works best when it's part of a bigger strategy that includes healthy meals, mindful eating, and light to moderate activity. While the supplement may help reduce calorie intake by encouraging smaller portion sizes and minimizing cravings, it is not intended to replace food, medication, or professional health guidance. When used with intention and discipline, LipoJaro may provide valuable support in staying on track, particularly for individuals prone to overeating or struggling with energy dips that derail consistent habits. Join the clean-label movement with LipoJaro! Plant-based, non-GMO, stimulant-free support—order now and take control of your cravings! Science & Clinical Support The Research Behind LipoJaro’s Ingredient Strategy While LipoJaro as a branded supplement has not been subjected to its own clinical trials, several of its key ingredients are supported by independent studies and scientific literature that examine their potential roles in appetite control, fat metabolism, and digestive health. The formulation reflects a common evidence-informed strategy used in modern weight management supplements: targeting multiple metabolic pathways without relying on synthetic stimulants. Below is a breakdown of some of the research associated with LipoJaro’s core ingredients, including how they may function in the body to support weight wellness. Disclaimer: The following summary includes third-party research on individual ingredients. These studies do not imply guaranteed results from LipoJaro. Always consult with your healthcare provider before relying on supplements for clinical support. Glucomannan and Appetite Regulation Glucomannan is one of the most studied soluble fibers in the context of weight management. According to a 2005 study published in the International Journal of Obesity, participants who took glucomannan before meals showed greater reductions in body weight compared to a placebo group, primarily due to improved satiety and reduced calorie intake. Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) and Fat Oxidation CLA has been examined for its possible impact on body composition. A meta-analysis published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition reviewed 18 studies and found that CLA supplementation produced modest fat loss over time in overweight individuals. Green Tea Extract and Thermogenic Support Green tea extract—particularly its catechins like EGCG—has shown potential in increasing energy expenditure and supporting fat oxidation. A study in the Journal of Nutrition found that green tea extract enhanced fat burning during exercise. Garcinia Cambogia and Craving Control Garcinia cambogia contains hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which has been examined for its effects on appetite and serotonin levels. Some studies suggest it may reduce calorie intake by promoting a sensation of fullness. Chromium and Blood Sugar Support Chromium has been studied for its role in improving insulin sensitivity and glucose regulation. Maintaining stable blood sugar can influence hunger patterns and help reduce cravings for sweets or processed carbohydrates. BioPerine® (Black Pepper Extract) for Absorption BioPerine is frequently added to enhance the bioavailability of other nutrients, ensuring the body absorbs and utilizes ingredients more efficiently. This compound does not directly affect fat loss but may improve the overall efficacy of the supplement. LipoJaro’s ingredient profile reflects an alignment with clinical research, focusing on appetite control, energy utilization, and digestive health—all without harsh stimulants. Though more research is always needed on supplement synergy and long-term use, the product is formulated in a way that mirrors many successful strategies in modern wellness science.

Expert Opinions: What Health Professionals Say How Today’s Wellness Experts View LipoJaro’s Ingredient Strategy While LipoJaro has not been formally endorsed by a specific medical organization or clinical board, many of its individual ingredients reflect trends and strategies endorsed by integrative nutritionists and holistic health professionals. These experts often encourage a whole-body, stimulant-free approach to metabolic wellness—an approach that mirrors LipoJaro’s formulation. Given the increasing awareness of gut health, fiber intake, and blood sugar regulation in weight management, many professionals now emphasize the importance of dietary support that does not rely on chemical stimulants or extreme restriction. Supplements like LipoJaro that combine soluble fiber, thermogenic botanicals, and absorption-enhancing compounds offer a balanced alternative for individuals seeking gentle assistance in their health journey. Disclaimer: The opinions shared below reflect general statements from professionals on key ingredients used in LipoJaro. These are not direct endorsements of the product and should not replace individualized medical advice. Nutritionist Insight on Glucomannan Functional nutritionists often highlight glucomannan as a leading ingredient in natural appetite support. By expanding in the stomach and slowing digestion, it may help reduce overeating, especially when consumed with adequate water before meals. According to registered dietitians, soluble fiber like glucomannan plays a dual role: it supports satiety and improves digestive health. These benefits are particularly important for those who struggle with energy dips caused by blood sugar spikes after large meals. Professional Support for CLA and Green Tea Extract In the field of sports nutrition and weight management coaching, CLA and green tea extract are often used for individuals who need metabolic support without the overstimulation of caffeine-based products. These ingredients are praised for their ability to complement regular activity and healthy eating, not replace it. Practitioners point out that green tea catechins, in particular, may assist with mild thermogenesis and antioxidant defense, both of which are relevant for long-term wellness and recovery. Emphasis on Safe and Gentle Supplementation One key message echoed by many professionals is the importance of realistic expectations and personalization. Most experts agree that fat burners are not magic solutions—but when used with structure and discipline, a well-designed formula like LipoJaro may be a reasonable option for individuals needing support with consistency, especially in the areas of appetite control and daily routine management. They also value formulations that avoid harsh chemicals or artificial additives, which aligns with LipoJaro’s clean-label promise and manufacturing standards. As public understanding of metabolism, digestion, and long-term weight regulation continues to grow, more health professionals are embracing tools that gently support the body's natural systems rather than override them with temporary, high-intensity effects. LipoJaro fits this emerging philosophy by focusing on balance, sustainability, and ingredient integrity. LipoJaro vs Other Weight Loss Supplements How LipoJaro Stands Out in a Crowded Market With countless weight loss supplements competing for attention, it can be difficult for consumers to distinguish between products that offer real support and those built around marketing hype. LipoJaro differentiates itself by embracing a non-stimulant, clean-label approach that caters to individuals looking for sustainable weight management support without sacrificing long-term health. Unlike many traditional fat burners that rely heavily on caffeine or synthetic ingredients to trigger short-term effects like rapid energy bursts or dehydration-induced water loss, LipoJaro offers a plant-based formula that works gradually with the body to help regulate appetite, optimize digestion, and support fat metabolism. Comparison Factors to Consider 1. Formulation Strategy 2. Intended Use and User Sensitivity 3. Transparency and Clean Labeling 4. Customer-Centric Policies Disclaimer: All supplement comparisons are made based on available product information as of the time of writing. Individual product effectiveness and user satisfaction may vary. Always refer to official sources before making purchase decisions. Ideal for a Wellness-Focused Audience LipoJaro is better suited to consumers who value long-term health and are not seeking dramatic overnight transformations. It aligns with 2025 trends in personalized nutrition, gut health optimization, and non-stimulant metabolic support. Those who are already practicing mindful eating and incorporating regular movement may find it particularly helpful in curbing excess hunger and reinforcing dietary structure. By contrast, more aggressive fat burners may appeal to competitive athletes or short-term transformation seekers—but often at the expense of tolerability or holistic health.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is LipoJaro and how does it work? LipoJaro is a non-stimulant fat burner supplement formulated with plant-based ingredients like glucomannan, CLA, green tea extract, and garcinia cambogia. It is designed to help support appetite regulation, promote feelings of fullness, and assist natural fat metabolism without relying on caffeine or synthetic stimulants. Taken before meals with water, it expands in the stomach to help reduce calorie intake and cravings throughout the day. How do I take LipoJaro for best results? For optimal results, take two capsules daily—one before each of your two largest meals, ideally breakfast and lunch. Take the capsules with at least 8 ounces of water to activate the glucomannan fiber and promote satiety. Consistency is key, so daily use alongside balanced eating and movement is recommended. Can LipoJaro help me lose weight without diet or exercise? LipoJaro is intended to support healthy weight management when used as part of a comprehensive lifestyle plan. While some users may experience benefits like reduced appetite or fewer cravings, it is not a replacement for proper nutrition or physical activity. Sustainable weight loss is most achievable when a supplement is combined with mindful eating, regular hydration, and moderate movement.

LipoJaro is manufactured in a GMP-certified, FDA-registered facility in the United States and contains non-GMO, clean-label ingredients. The formula avoids stimulants and synthetic additives.

If you have any medical conditions or are on medication, consult a healthcare professional before use. Does LipoJaro have any side effects? Most reported side effects are mild and temporary. Some users have noted: These effects typically resolve as the body adjusts. To avoid discomfort, always take LipoJaro with a full glass of water and never exceed the recommended dose.

Title: Adobe Premiere Pro vs. Apple Final Cut Pro: Which Video Editing App Should You Use?
URL: https://me.pcmag.com/en/video-editing/29704/adobe-premiere-pro-vs-apple-final-cut-pro-which-video-editing-app-should-you-use
Time Published: 2025-05-06T18:36:26Z
Full Content:
Apple's Final Cut Pro gives you a wealth of powerful video editing tools in a relatively simple interface, making it well worth the one-time price for professionals and serious hobbyists alike. VS Adobe Premiere Pro is an expansive, professional-level video editing program with top-notch editing tools, swift rendering speeds, useful collaboration features, and a well-designed interface. Adobe Premiere Pro requires a Creative Cloud subscription. You have three main options: an annual plan you pay up front ($263.88), an annual plan you pay monthly ($22.99 per month), or a month-to-month plan ($34.49 per month). Adobe also offers more affordable plans for students and pricier ones for businesses. If you want the entire Creative Cloud suite, which includes Audition, Photoshop, Illustrator, and a raft of other Adobe creative software, you need to pay $59.99 per month. The subscription model not only gets you program updates, which Adobe delivers semiannually, but also 100GB of cloud storage for syncing media. Any of these plans entitles you to activate the software on just two computers. A perpetual license for Final Cut Pro costs $299.99. It works out to be cheaper than Premiere Pro after just a year and a half, and you still get feature updates. Final Cut Pro is available from the Mac App Store, which eases the process of downloading updates and lets you install the program on multiple computers as long as you sign into the same Apple account. Winner: Apple Final Cut Pro Premiere Pro runs on both Windows and macOS. The online user guide states that it is the company's policy "to support the current and the most recent previous version of each operating system." For the moment, that means Windows 10 (64-bit) version 22H2 (or later) or Windows 11 with: On macOS, you need version 12 or later with: Premiere Pro runs on Apple silicon–based Macs natively. As you might expect, Final Cut Pro runs only on Macs. It requires macOS 14.6 or later, 8GB of RAM (it recommends 16GB), and a Metal-capable graphics card for Intel-based computers. For VR headset support, you also need SteamVR. Final Cut Pro runs smoothly on Apple silicon–based Macs as a native application. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro Premiere Pro stays true to the tradition of high-end, professional-level software. Ease of use and simplicity of interface are not paramount among its goals. That said, there's no reason that a determined amateur with time to devote to learning the software couldn’t use it. Adobe has other products more appropriate for hobbyists, including Premiere Elements. Apple makes the upgrade path from its consumer-level video editor, iMovie, very smooth. The latest version of Final Cut on the desktop also makes it easy to import projects you started on an iPhone or iPad. Winner: Apple Final Cut Pro Premiere Pro uses a traditional nonlinear editor (NLE) timeline with tracks and track heads. It calls your timeline content a sequence, and you can create nested sequences, subsequences, and subclips to keep everything organized. The timeline has tabs for multiple sequences, which can be helpful if you're working with nested sequences. Longtime video editors are likely more comfortable with this setup than with Apple's more inventive trackless Magnetic Timeline. Adobe's system also fits with some pro workflows in which the tracks are in an expected arrangement. It works differently from consumer video editing apps, however, because it automatically separates a clip's audio track from its video. The timeline is very scalable and offers the usual razor, ripple, roll, slip, and slide tools. The interface is extremely configurable, letting you undock any and all panels. You can show or hide FX badges, keyframes, thumbnails, and waveforms. You get seven preconfigured workspaces (including Assembly, Editing, Color, and Titles) compared with Final Cut's mere three. Apple's innovative trackless Magnetic Timeline is easier on the eyes than the traditional timeline interface, and it offers several editing advantages, such as connected Auditions, clips, and roles (descriptive labels such as Dialog, Effects, Music, Titles, and Video). Auditions let you designate optional clips or takes for a spot in your movie, and you can group clips into compound clips—roughly the equivalent of Premiere's Nested Sequences. Instead of tracks, Final Cut Pro uses lanes, with a primary storyline that everything else attaches to. This makes keeping everything in sync easier than in Premiere. Final Cut Pro's interface is less configurable than Premiere's. You can't split panels off into windows, except for the Preview window, which is very spare in the control department—the only options are Play and Pause. Premiere offers a lot more here, with buttons for Export Frame, Extract, Go to In, Go to Previous Edit Point, Lift, and Step Back. As mentioned, Final Cut offers just three prebuilt workspaces (Color & Effects, Default, and Organize). Winner: Tie Like a traditional NLE, Premiere Pro lets you store related media in bins, which are similar to folders. As with folders, you can have bins within bins. You can also apply color labels to assets, but not keyword tags. The Libraries panel lets you share assets among other Adobe applications, such as After Effects and Photoshop. Apple's program organizes your media through events, keyword tagging, libraries, and roles. The library is the overarching container that includes your projects, events, and clips, and it keeps track of all your edits and options. You can also manage storage targets and perform batch clip renaming. Winner: Apple Final Cut Pro Premiere Pro works with pretty much any media format of any level of professionalism, as well as media type for which you installed codecs on your computer. That even includes Apple ProRes. The software supports working with native (raw) camera formats, including those for ARRI, Canon, Panasonic, RED, and Sony. There's not much video you can create or import that Premiere can't handle. It even supports XML documents you export from Final Cut Pro.Final Cut Pro works with the HEVC codec that many 4K video cameras and Apple's iPhones use. Like Premiere Pro, Final Cut supports native formats from all the major video camera makers, including ARRI, Canon, Panasonic, RED, and Sony, as well as many video-capable still cameras. It, too, handles XML file imports and exports.Winner: Tie After Effects, Premiere's stablemate in the Creative Cloud ecosystem, is the industry-standard motion graphics tool. It dovetails smoothly with Premiere Pro but is more difficult to master than Apple Motion, which now has many of the same capabilities. Regardless, After Effects is the tool to learn if you want to pursue professional video editing as a career. The app costs $263.88 per year. Apple Motion is also a powerful tool for creating effects, titles, and transitions. It supports custom templates, logical layers, and a rich plug-in ecosystem. Motion is probably a better fit if you use Final Cut Pro as your primary editor. Even if you don't, it's just a one-time, $49.99 purchase.Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro The latest generative AI feature to land in Adobe's video software is Generative Extend, which creates extra video frames (including 4K) from the surrounding content for cases in which a clip isn't quite long enough to fit the rest of your timeline. Other Premiere Pro features include AI speech-to-text with automatic translation, color management that recognizes raw and log footage and automatically color-corrects it, and Media Intelligence, which recognizes clip contents to help you find them. Apple's pro video editor is playing catch-up with Premiere Pro. It now includes auto-captioning from speech in videos, but still lacks both text-based editing and video generation capabilities. It does, however, integrate with macOS's Image Playground to generate cartoon-like still images, for what that's worth. Magnetic Mask (apply effects just to fine-tuned masked areas) and Scene Removal round out some of the other recent AI tools in the app. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro Premiere Pro includes the Lumetri Color tools. These are pro-level color grading features that were formerly part of the standalone SpeedGrade application. The Lumetri tools support 3D lookup tables (LUTs) for powerful and customizable looks. The tools offer a remarkable amount of color manipulation, along with a great selection of film and HDR looks. You can adjust black point, contrast, exposure, highlights, shadows, and white balance—all of which you can activate with keyframes. Faded Film, Saturation, Sharpen, and Vibrance adjustment presets are also available. Most impressive are the Color Wheel and Curves options. The Lumetri Scope view is also especially cool; it shows the current frame's proportional use of red, green, and blue. As mentioned, Premiere Pro includes a dedicated workspace for color editing. To compete with Adobe's impressive Lumetri Color tools, Final Cut has a Color Wheel tool that's impressive in its own right. Color Wheels show a puck in the middle that lets you move an image toward green, blue, or red; the result appears to the side of the wheel. You can also adjust brightness and saturation with the wheels, separately control everything (with the Master wheel), or adjust just shadows, midtones, or highlights. It's a remarkably powerful and intuitive set of tools. If wheels are not to your taste, the Color Board option shows a simple linear view of your color settings. The Color Curves tool lets you use multiple control points to adjust each of the three primary colors for very specific points on the brightness scale. Luma, RGB Parade, and Vectorscope monitors give you incredible insight into your movie's color usage. You can even edit a single color value using a dropper. Final Cut now supports color LUTs from camera manufacturers such as ARRI, Canon, Red, and Sony, as well as custom LUTs for effects. You can combine these effects with others in a stacked arrangement. Color scopes adapt to HDR editing, as do the color editing tools. Supported formats include Rec. 2020 HLG and Rec. 2020 PQ for HDR10 output.Winner: Tie Premiere offers Photoshop-like control over title text formatting, with a vast number of adjustments and fonts such as kerning, leading, rotation, shadow, stroking, and tracking, just to name a few. But for 3D manipulation, you need to head to After Effects. For captions, Premiere Pro is a hard act to follow: It not only creates captions from spoken words in your video, but, as mentioned, it also lets you edit based on the captions. As a result, you can take out ums and uhs in the video simply by removing the text from the caption. Premiere can then automatically translate the captions into 27 international languages and display multiple language tracks at once. Final Cut Pro includes strong 3D title editing with keyframe motion options. You get lots of control over title overlays, with dozens of animation templates. You edit text and position and size the titles right in the video preview; there's no need for an external title editor. Final Cut Pro's 3D Titles offer eight basic templates and four more cinematic ones, including a cool 3D Earth choice for sci-fi projects. There are 20 font presets, but you can use any style and size you like. Materials such as concrete, fabric, and plastic give your titles any texture you desire. You also get a bunch of lighting options. For maximum control, you can edit the 3D titles in Motion. Extrude 2D titles into 3D by tapping the 3D Text option in the Text Inspector, and you can then position and rotate the text to taste on three axes. Apple's software can now automatically transcribe spoken words in clips to text captions, but Premiere Pro goes way beyond that, identifying separate speakers, translating, and allowing text-based timeline editing. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro Premiere Pro lets you play 360-degree VR footage and change the field of view and angle. You can watch this content in anaglyphic form, which is a fancy way of saying you can see it in 3D using standard red-and-blue glasses. You can also have your video track a head-mounted display's view. You can't use Premiere Pro (or Final Cut Pro) to edit 360-degree footage unless you stitch it into equirectangular format. Corel VideoStudio, CyberLink PowerDirector, and Pinnacle Studio can all open 360-degree footage without this conversion. You can't see the spherical view alongside the flattened view in Premiere like in those apps, but you can easily toggle between them if you add the VR button to the preview window. Helpfully, Premiere lets you tag a video as VR so that Facebook or YouTube can tell it's 360-degree content. Apple's pro video editor now has better 360-degree features, including support for Apple's VisionPro and the HTC Vive (sorry Meta Quest users). It offers 360-degree titles, some effects, and a nifty Patch tool that removes the camera and tripod from your movie. With the standalone Compressor app ($49.99), you can share 360-degree video directly to Facebook, Vimeo, and YouTube. You also get stabilization for 360-degree video. Winner: Tie Premiere Pro's Audio Mixer shows balance, mute/solo, clipping indicator, pan, volume unit (VU) meter controls for all timeline tracks. You can use it to make adjustments as the project plays. The app automatically creates new tracks when you drop an audio clip in the timeline, and you can specify types, such as 5.1, adaptive, mono, standard (which can contain a combination of mono and stereo files), and stereo. Double-clicking the VU meters or panning dials returns their levels to zero. The audio meters next to Premiere's timeline are resizable and let you solo any track. The program also supports hardware controllers and third-party VSP plug-ins. If you have Adobe Audition, you can round-trip your audio between that and Premiere Pro for advanced techniques such as adaptive noise reduction, automatic click removal, compression, parametric EQ, and studio reverb. Audio editing is a strength of Final Cut Pro. It can automatically fix hum, noise, and peaks, or you can manually take care of these problems. Over 1,300 royalty-free sound effects are available, as are a long list of plug-ins. One impressive trick is the ability to match separately recorded tracks. For example, if you shoot HD footage with a DSLR and record sound simultaneously on another recorder, the Match Audio feature aligns the sound source (Premiere Pro has a similar feature). Support for Apple Logic Pro plug-ins gives you even more powerful sound editing options. Finally, you get a surround-sound mixer to animate or locate 5.1 audio, as well as either a 10- or 31-band equalizer.Winner: Tie Premiere Pro offers more export formats than you are ever likely to need. You get even more options via the Media Encoder app, which can target Blu-ray, DVD, Facebook, Twitter, or Vimeo formats. Encoder lets you batch encode to target multiple devices in a single job, such as mobile phones, iPads, and HDTVs. Premiere can also output media using H.265 and the Rec. 2020 color space. Adobe's updated Export interface mode makes the process simpler yet more powerful; it lets you choose multiple social targets. Final Cut Pro's output options are comparatively limited unless you add the companion application, Apple Compressor. The base app can, however, export to XML and produce HDR, wide-color-space output including Rec. 2020 Hybrid Log Gamma and Rec. 2020 HDR10. Compressor adds the ability to customize output settings and perform batch output jobs. It also adds support for Blu-ray and DVD menus and chapter themes. You can even package movies in the format necessary for iTunes. Winner: Tie Like most modern video editors, Premiere Pro uses proxy views of your video content to speed up apparent performance, and I didn't encounter any lag while testing normal editing operations. The software takes advantage of graphics CUDA and OpenCL hardware acceleration and multicore CPUs with its Adobe Mercury Playback Engine. Premiere Pro locks the app during exporting by default, though you can get around this behavior by choosing Queue in the Export dialog via the Media Encoder app. One of the primary goals of Final Cut Pro is to take advantage of 64-bit processing and the newer Apple silicon chips. Conveniently, exporting in Final Cut happens in the background, so you can continue working in the program. I test export time by creating a 5-minute movie consisting of four clips of mixed types with a standard set of transitions. My test media files include some 8K and more 4K source clips. I render it to H.264 1080p, 60fps, using H.264 High Profile. The audio is AAC 192Kbps. For testing, I use a MacBook Air with an M1 processor and 8GB of RAM running macOS Sequoia. It's on the low end of power for video editing, so it shows differences more distinctly than more expensive hardware. Premiere Pro easily bested Final Cut Pro. The former completed the task in 170 seconds, while the latter required 205 seconds. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro Adobe maintains a large ecosystem of creative apps and services to support Premiere Pro. Aside from the Creative Cloud apps that work smoothly with Premiere, including After Effects, Audition, and Photoshop, Adobe offers the Premiere Rush mobile app, from which you can import projects. Adobe Express and Firefly, both of which you get with a Premiere subscription, include powerful AI video generation capabilities. Another app, Adobe Capture, lets you snap images for use as colors, shapes, and textures in Premiere Pro. Adobe's support for Frame.io collaboration and cloud storage is important for professional use. Other lesser-known Creative Cloud apps include Adobe Character Animator, a nifty app that produces animations based on live actors' faces and body movements, and Animate, which does the same for illustrations. You can bring both types of projects into Premiere Pro. Finally, the Adobe Stock integration comes in handy for those times you need B-roll or other stock media. Unfortunately, Stock is not part of a Premiere Pro subscription; plans start at $29.99 per month. It's a snap to import projects from iMovie on an iPhone or iPad into the pro editor, as mentioned. And that goes for the newer Final Cut Camera app, available on iPhone and iPad. The Final Cut iPad app ($4.99 per month) allows multicam shooting, as does the Camera app. The already-mentioned Motion and Compressor sibling applications, along with Apple's high-end sound editor, Logic Pro, extend the program's capabilities, but that collection of apps can't compete with Premiere Pro's. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro PC hardware is nice, but it’s not much use without innovative software.

If you want your money to work for you, dividend stocks are one of the smartest ways to build steady passive income over time. Many investors, from beginners to retirees, rely on dividends to supplement their income without having to sell their shares. In this guide, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know about the best dividend stocks, how to choose them, and which ones to consider adding to your portfolio in 2025. Contents Dividend stocks are shares of companies that regularly return a portion of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. These payments are typically made quarterly, though some companies pay monthly or annually. Unlike growth stocks that reinvest most of their earnings to expand the business, dividend-paying companies are usually more established and focus on rewarding shareholders. Key Features of Dividend Stocks: Dividend investing is popular for many reasons: When searching for the best dividend stocks, you need to look beyond just the dividend yield. Here are some key metrics: This is the annual dividend per share divided by the stock’s current price. A higher yield means more income, but extremely high yields can be a red flag. This measures how much of a company’s earnings are paid out in dividends. A lower payout ratio is generally better, suggesting the company has room to grow or weather downturns. Look for companies that consistently increase their dividends year after year. This shows financial strength and shareholder commitment. Stable earnings mean the company can maintain or grow its dividend even in tough economic times. This is the cash left after operational expenses and capital expenditures. It’s a more accurate indicator of dividend sustainability. These are well-established companies with reliable dividends and strong financials. Think Procter & Gamble or Johnson & Johnson. Companies that have increased dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. Firms with 50+ years of consecutive dividend increases. These are required to pay out 90% of their income as dividends. Examples include Realty Income and American Tower. Stable and regulated businesses that provide consistent dividends. Now let’s dive into some of the best dividend stocks to consider for steady passive income. If you’re more risk-tolerant and looking for higher income, consider these: Spread your investments across different industries to reduce risk. Use DRIP plans to compound your returns over time. Hold dividend stocks in Roth IRAs or tax-deferred accounts to avoid unnecessary taxes. Don’t just chase high yields—balance them with companies that offer stability and growth. Keep an eye on earnings reports, dividend announcements, and economic conditions. If picking individual stocks feels overwhelming, dividend ETFs are a great alternative. Even strong companies can reduce or eliminate dividends during tough times. Stock prices can fluctuate, even if the dividend remains steady. If dividend growth doesn’t keep up with inflation, purchasing power may decline. Rising interest rates can hurt utility and REIT stocks. Investing in the best dividend stocks can be a game-changer for anyone looking to earn steady, passive income. With a little research, patience, and diversification, you can build a dividend portfolio that supports your financial goals now and in the future. Whether you’re saving for retirement, supplementing your income, or just want your money to work smarter, dividend stocks offer a reliable path to financial independence.

Click here to subscribe and get it in your inbox every Tuesday. While the U.S. added more jobs than expected last month, other labor market indicators are not so ... More optimistic. As part of my job, I spend quite a bit of time each week speaking with job-seekers and perusing job boards to see who is hiring and for what positions. In the last month, one thing has been—at least anecdotally—clear: More job postings are popping up. Friday’s job numbers confirmed this trend. The U.S. added 177,000 new jobs in April, higher than analysts’ expectations, according to the latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Wages also rose 3.8% year-over-year to a record average of $36.06 an hour for nonfarm employees. But economists are warning against too much optimism from Friday’s report. For one, the private sector added only 62,000 jobs in April, less than half of what analysts expected as employers held tight in the face of the expected impact from tariffs, marking the slowest job growth in the sector since July 2024. “Unease is the word of the day,” Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP said in the company’s national employment report. Then there are the layoff numbers. While unemployment remained flat at 4.2%, layoffs increased by 63% compared to last April, though they decreased month-over-month. DOGE-related cuts accounted for almost half of all layoffs, either by directly cutting government positions or by the downstream effects of such cuts. And increased hiring numbers could be a result of companies’ front-ending against tariff and macroeconomic impacts, preparing themselves for tougher times. Still, President Trump was optimistic, celebrating “strong employment” numbers. We’ll be keeping our eyes out to see how things shake up, especially as the class of 2025 joins the market. Practical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter. When the roles are flipped, how should you deliver bad news to your boss? In the world of hypercommunication, here is how to make sure you’re communicating effectively. An increasing number of workers are taking microretirements to prevent burnout. Watch out for these signs that you could be the first cut in a layoff. News from the world of work. AI startups are increasingly requiring their employees to work six or seven days a week, Forbes’ Richard Nieva reports. While hustle culture has always been glorified in Silicon Valley, this could be the first time companies are brazen enough to advertise the long-hour expectations. The Philippines is the latest country to offer a digital nomad visa for remote workers. The requirements are quite standard, including proving you are able to generate sufficient income outside the country. Feeling understaffed? It’s not just your company. The Wall Street Journal found that while corporate America isn’t massively laying off workers, many have paused hiring and are leaving more jobs unfilled. Turns out laying off employees and replacing them with AI is not as easy—or effective—as it looks. A new survey found that 55% of leaders who let go of workers as a direct result of deploying more AI functions admit they made the wrong decision. Under President Trump, the IRS has shed more than 11% of its workforce, and more cuts are on the way, Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb reports. Layoffs at the agency have impacted workers across the country, including Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, with tax auditors being the hardest hit.

Title: Trump says pharmaceutical tariffs are coming. Here's what to expect
URL: https://qz.com/trump-tariffs-pharma-companies-astrazeneca-gsk-1851779389
Time Published: 2025-05-06T17:53:00Z
Full Content:
President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs are headed to the medicine aisle next. On Monday, Trump announced his plans to place tariffs on pharmaceutical imports “within the next two weeks,” signing an executive order designed to boost drug companies’ manufacturing in the U.S. While the exact tariff rates haven’t yet been specified, the president has suggested they could be as high as 200%. “We don’t want to be buying our pharmaceuticals from other countries because if we’re in a war, we’re in a problem, we want to be able to make our own,” Trump said in a fact sheet. “As we invest in the future, we will permanently bring our medical supply chains back home. We will produce our medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and treatments right here in the United States.” The president’s executive order gives U.S. agencies a clear message: Move faster. Trump has directed the FDA to speed up approvals for domestic manufacturing facilities while promising more surprise inspections of overseas plants and raising inspection fees for foreign drugmakers. Meanwhile, the EPA is being told to fast-track construction permits for pharmaceutical facilities. The White House has estimated that it can take five to 10 years to build manufacturing capacity for pharmaceuticals, which it says is “unacceptable from a national security standpoint.” The Commerce Department launched a Section 232 investigation into pharmaceutical imports in April, paving the way for these tariffs. That’s the same provision the Trump administration previously used to justify sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum in 2018. “Pharma companies are going to come roaring back, they’re coming roaring back, they’re all coming back to our country, because if they don’t, they got a big tax to pay,” Trump said in his original “Liberation Day” tariff announcement on April 2. But the president’s move to promote U.S. manufacturing by placing tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry could backfire. Pharmaceutical companies are already navigating tight margins and global competition. Broad tariffs on imported drugs could lead to higher prices for patients and supply disruptions in a system that’s already under strain. Drug companies had previously enjoyed favorable trade terms, particularly under a 1994 World Trade Organization agreement that set low or zero tariffs on finished products and key active ingredients. In 2023, the U.S. imported more than $200 billion of pharmaceutical products — and about 73% came from European countries that have long served as manufacturing hubs for the industry. Ireland, Germany and Switzerland were the top three jurisdictions for U.S. pharmaceutical imports, according to consulting firm PwC. And many of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in medicines that are sold in the U.S. are made abroad, particularly in India and China. The tariffs’ implications could be significant for companies based in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The U.K. exported $8.1 billion in pharmaceuticals (one of the sovereign state’s top imports) to the U.S. in 2023, with around $4.1 billion originating from U.K.-based production. Global giants GSK (GSK+1.80%) and AstraZeneca (AZN+0.03%) are both based in the U.K., making them vulnerable to any proposed import taxes. Both companies plan to lobby hard to shield the sector from such tariffs, joining a group that successfully secured temporary exemptions for pharmaceuticals from a 10% baseline tariff that Trump previously levied on many other foreign goods. But with the president’s tariff announcement looming, the pressure is on for these companies to either relocate manufacturing to the U.S. or risk facing a hefty price tag. A 2023 analysis conducted by Ernst & Young found that a 25% tariff on pharmaceutical imports could lead to an increase of up to $51 billion a year in drug costs, potentially raising prices for consumers by as much as 12.9%. Giovanni Barbella, the global head of strategy and supply chain at the Swiss generic drugmaker Sandoz (NVS-0.56%), told The Guardian that tariffs would lead to supply disruptions and price increases, hitting U.S. patients hardest. “We are producing products on a very tight margin,” Barbella said. “That’s the nature of our industry. So ultimately, higher production cost, including the cost of tariffs, will lead to higher prices.” The Association for Accessible Medicines warned in February that tariffs could strain cash-strapped generic drugmakers and distributors, potentially leading to increased costs for patients and disruptions in the supply chain. “There can be even more supply disruption, because some players can leave the [U.S.] market and focus on markets where they can make more business,” Barbella added. “So ultimately, the risk is that the U.S. patient will suffer the most.” The U.S. is already battling a record number of drug shortages, from cancer medications to antibiotics. Nearly 270 drugs were on the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists’ official list of active drug shortages as of early 2025. Many of these shortages stem from global supply chain issues, including reliance on single-source manufacturers overseas. Tariffs could worsen the situation by discouraging imports or driving up costs to unsustainable levels. For patients, this could mean delayed treatments or forced switches to less effective alternatives. And for hospitals and insurers, it could translate to higher costs and more administrative headaches. Mark Samuels, the CEO of Medicines UK, which represents Britain-based generic drugmakers, told The Guardian that, “in an insurance-based system as the U.S. has, if medicine costs increase and insurance runs out, then that does increase the risk that people either can’t afford to complete their cancer treatments or pay for it altogether.” Those comments — and the substantial risks rising drug costs pose — were echoed by Gareth Sheridan, the CEO of the Irish-founded pharmaceutical company Nutriband. “These types of treatments can’t afford a disruption in the global supply chain,” Sheridan told the BBC. “As a comparable situation: tariffs on automobiles. You can’t afford a BMW? Buy a Ford and you can still get to work. If you have a 25% hike on chemotherapy and you can’t afford your treatment any more, what’s the alternative? I mean, ultimately, people are going to die.” Some major pharmaceutical companies are already trying to adapt, announcing major investments in U.S.-based manufacturing. To insulate themselves from any potential tariffs, Swiss pharma giants Roche (RHHBY-0.05%) and Novartis are committing $50 billion and $23 billion, respectively, to U.S. investments over the coming years. In November, AstraZeneca announced a $3.5 billion investment and recently confirmed it will shift production of certain U.S.-bound drugs from Europe to the U.S. Meanwhile, U.S.-based Eli Lilly (LLY+0.74%), the producer of diabetes and weight-loss medications Mounjaro and Zepbound, is allocating at least $27 billion to build four new manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ-0.53%) plans to invest $55 billion in U.S. manufacturing and research over the next four years. The company, which has its headquarters in New Jersey, could be especially affected by any new U.S. tariffs due to its extensive production footprint across Europe, including operations in the U.K., Ireland, Switzerland, Italy, and Belgium. But even with these moves, shifting production on a large scale is neither quick nor easy. Albert Bourla, Pfizer’s (PFE+1.72%) CEO, said on the company’s first-quarter earnings call that the New York-based firm could undertake “tremendous investments” in the U.S. if there were clearer trade policies and if tariff threats were removed. The company’s chief financial officer, Dave Denton, said that the already existing tariffs are expected to cost the company around $150 million in 2025. And analysts say that’s a real risk: If costs go up and regulatory uncertainty grows, drugmakers may delay projects or pass costs onto consumers. Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.61%), the Danish company behind blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, could also feel the squeeze. While it has a growing U.S. presence — including a major site in North Carolina and more than 10,000 U.S.-based employees — it imports some finished products and components from Europe. Still, Novo Nodisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen said in an interview with Bloomberg TV that the company’s operations in the U.S. would be sufficient “to a large degree. ... The base case is that this is something we can handle.” Trump has yet to formally specify a rate for these pharmaceutical tariffs. The full consequences of the administration’s policy will unfold as pharmaceutical companies adjust their strategies in the coming months. With significant stakes at play for both the U.S. economy and global health systems, it remains to be seen how the president’s approach will ultimately shake out. For now, drugmakers and consumers alike must prepare for what could be a bumpy road ahead. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Vornado Realty Trust Earnings Beat Estimates in Q1

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Vornado Realty Trust posted better-than-expected earnings results for the first quarter of 2025, and provided more details on its massive 70-year lease with New York University (NYU), sending its stock higher by more than 3 percent on Tuesday afternoon. The real estate giant reported quarterly funds from operations (FFO) of $126.2 million, or 63 cents per diluted share, above the 55 cents per diluted share reported for the same period last year and topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents per share. Net income for the first quarter was $86.8 million, or 43 cents per diluted share, above the net loss of 5 cents per diluted share for the first quarter of 2024. Revenue was $461.5 million for 2025’s first quarter, exceeding the $436.3 million reported for last year’s first quarter. It also beat the Zacks estimate by 3 percent. Vornado attributed its strong quarterly performance to the $350 million sale of a portion of Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo’s flagship store at 666 Fifth Avenue in Midtown, the ground rent at its Penn 1 building being set nearly $11 million lower than Vornado expected — although at a price which is still under litigation — and strong leasing activity in Manhattan. “Manhattan continues to be the best real estate market in the country, especially so for office, but also for apartments and retail,” Steven Roth, CEO of Vornado, said on the company’s earnings call. “In the 180 million-square-foot Class A better building market in which we compete, demand continues to be robust.” On Monday, Vornado announced the completion of the 1.1 million-square-foot, 70-year master lease at 770 Broadway with NYU, which it first mentioned in November. The university made a prepaid lease payment of $935 million to Vornado and will make annual lease payments of $9.3 million for the entire life of the lease, Vornado said. Vornado was facing a hole in the property after Facebook parent Meta said it would drop 275,000 square feet once its lease expired, but NYU swooped in to take over the entire building. “We use a portion of the prepaid rent payment to repay the $700 million mortgage loan, which previously encumbered the property, and $200 million to increase our cash balances,” Roth said on the call. “Though, this transaction is a lease … it is treated as a sale.” Vornado had an active quarter of leasing activity across the retail and office space for the 2025 first quarter. The company leased 1.04 million square feet across its portfolio — 709,000 square feet of that in New York City — and commanded starting rents of $95 per square foot, Roth said. That includes the 337,000 square feet Universal Music signed at Penn 2. At the start of the earnings call, Roth acknowledged that the current macroeconomic environment is very different from its fourth-quarter earnings call in February. Still, despite political and economic uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s tariffs, Roth has a positive outlook going forward, saying tariffs could “make a big dent in getting our federal budget deficit under control.” “Notwithstanding the tactics, reducing government bloat has to be a good thing,” Roth said. “I am agnostic, whatever the outcome. I believe that this global kerfuffle will be resolved more quickly than you think.” Amanda Schiavo can be reached at aschiavo@commercialobserver.com.

Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) CEO Jensen Huang said AI has revived a dying San Francisco that many thought wouldn’t recover from the pandemic. “It’s because of AI that San Francisco is back,” Huang said while speaking to Jacob Helberg, Trump’s undersecretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment, at The Hill & Valley Forum. “Anybody who lives in San Francisco, you’ll know what I’m talking about. Just about everybody evacuated San Francisco,” he said, “Now it’s thriving again. It’s all because of AI.” A 2024 article from The San Francisco Standard called AI companies San Francisco’s “most desired tenants.” It cited a JLL (JLL-1.68%) report that found AI companies leased north of 1.7 million square feet of office space since 2022, when ChatGPT was released. Chris Pham, senior analyst at JLL, predicted a continued AI boom in the city, likening it to the invention of electricity, instead of just another new industry. In his remarks with Helberg, Huang acknowledged that as AI progresses, “new jobs will be created, some jobs will be lost, and every job will be changed.” “It’s not AI that’s going to take your job. It’s not AI that’s going to destroy your company,” he said, encouraging widespread adoption of the technology. “It’s the company and the person who uses AI that’s going to take your job. And so that’s something to internalize.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: [Latest] U.S. Kids Beverage Market to Hit Valuation of US$ 30.24 Billion By 2033 | Astute Analytica

Time Published: 2025-05-06T16:30:00Z
Full Content:
May 06, 2025 12:30 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, May 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The U.S. kids beverage market is projected was valued at US$ 18.84 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 30.24 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 5.53% during the forecast period 2025–2033. The United States kids beverage market has spent the past thirty-six months in a trial-and-error cycle that is rapidly reshaping category leadership. IRI panel data for 2024 show that 61% of households with children bought at least one “limited-time” flavor over the last year, up from 38% in 2021. Brands that capitalized early—Capri Sun with Strawberry Kiwi Splash, Gatorade Zero Kids with Glacier Freeze, and Honest Kids with Super Fruit Punch—saw unit velocities climb 9–14% even as shelf facings remained flat. Fruit blends now account for 42% of all juice-box UPCs, overtaking single-flavor apple offerings for the first time since records were kept. Within enhanced waters, blue raspberry and cotton-candy variants—once regarded as novelty items—have crossed the 5% share threshold, a milestone usually associated with sustained repeat purchases. Download Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/united-states-kids-beverages-market Flavor churn is, however, only half the story; manufacturers are leveraging real-time social listening to identify micro-trends before they hit mainstream retail in the kids beverage market. PepsiCo’s Stingray dashboard, for example, flags elementary-school lunchbox mentions on TikTok every four hours, feeding that intel to R&D teams that can turn around pilot batches in under ten weeks. The payoff is visible: “Dragonfruit Burst” appeared in Walmart end-caps nationwide just 94 days after first trending online. At the same time, legacy players are pruning underperforming classics—Orange Tang was delisted by two major grocers in Q3-2023—to make room for Gen-Alpha-friendly mashups like mango-peach and watermelon-lime. Stakeholders should therefore view flavor leadership not as a static mantle but as a rolling sprint governed by data-backed agility and nimble co-packer partnerships. Key Findings in United States Kids Beverage Market Functional hydration products reshape wellness narratives for school-aged consumers today in the Kids Beverage Market Wellness claims have become table stakes, but functional hydration adds a science-backed edge that resonates with parents scanning ingredient lists. The 2024 Kids’ Beverage Attributes Survey from SPINS reveals that 47% of U.S. guardians now look for electrolytes, B-vitamins, or prebiotics when purchasing drinks for children aged six to twelve. Propelled by this interest, brands such as Prime Hydration Kids, BODYARMOR Flash I.V., and Pedialyte Sport Junior grew combined unit sales by 28% year over year. Notably, products with 100 mg or less sodium per serving doubled their shelf presence, underscoring a “clean-label electrolyte” narrative that appeals to pediatricians and school administrators striving to curb excess salt. Energy modulation is the second pillar driving functional launches in the United States kids beverage market. Caffeine remains off-limits for under-13s, so formulators are leaning on L-theanine, magnesium, and plant-derived adaptogens to support focus without jitters. DSM-Firmenich reports a 300% surge in requests for water-stable L-theanine emulsions suitable for 6-ounce pouches. Meanwhile, Nestlé’s Boost Kids Essentials fortified drink introduced 4 g of prebiotic fiber to address digestive health, and early ACV scanner data indicate a 12% repeat-purchase rate within eight weeks—an impressive signal for a premium-priced SKU. Parents, buoyed by pediatric health-influencer endorsements on Instagram, appear willing to pay a 35 ¢ per-unit premium if the beverage promises immunity or cognitive benefits validated by peer-reviewed studies. Decision makers should therefore embed clinical substantiation into marketing narratives and consider partnering with children’s hospitals for longitudinal trials, as evidence-based storytelling is rapidly becoming the currency of consumer trust in this evolving segment. Plant-based and dairy-alternative beverages gain traction among allergic children nationwide Food-allergy prevalence among U.S. minors now stands at 8%, according to the CDC’s 2024 summary, fueling demand for plant-based drinks that circumvent common allergens. Soy once dominated the conversation in the kids beverage market, yet Oatly’s 2023 nationwide placement of single-serve oat-milk cartons sparked a 92% velocity increase across K-5 cafeterias operated by Chartwells Schools. Almond and coconut lines remain niche in elementary settings due to tree-nut concerns, but pea-protein formulas—Ripple Kids, for example—have captured a 19% share within the shelf-stable “milk substitutes” aisle. Nutrient density, especially a 50-% higher calcium content versus skim dairy, is a key purchase driver cited by 63% of surveyed parents. Beyond nutritional parity, sustainability messaging bolsters category legitimacy in the kids beverage market. Life-cycle-assessment firm HowGood notes that oat-milk boxes yield 45% lower greenhouse-gas emissions than equivalent UHT cow’s-milk cartons—data now called out via QR codes on pack fronts. Retailers are responding: Kroger expanded its “Plant-Powered Kids” set from eight to twenty-four facings in 2024, while Target’s Good & Gather launched an organic chickpea-milk line at $3.99 per four-pack. Flavor remains critical; chocolate leads, but strawberry oat-milk earned an impressive 4.8-star rating on the Walmart Marketplace within three weeks of debut. As brands explore sunflower-seed bases and fermented rice options, clear allergen statements and school-compliance certification will determine acceptance, underscoring the necessity for rigorous cross-contact controls and transparent labeling strategies. Sugar reduction strategies influence consumer behavior and parental purchase criteria With pediatric obesity rates touching 19.7% in 2023 (CDC), the United States kids beverage market faces relentless scrutiny over added sugars. The FDA’s updated voluntary guidance encourages manufacturers to limit kids’ drinks to 6 g of total sugar per 8 oz serving, down from 10 g previously. Consequently, 72% of new UPCs launched in 2024 utilize high-intensity sweetener blends—stevia-allulose or monk-fruit-erythritol—to achieve a 35–50% caloric cut. Kraft Heinz’s Capri Sun Reformulation 3.0 removed 2.5 billion grams of sugar from U.S. circulation between 2020 and 2024, a stat widely cited in retailer sustainability scorecards. Consumer sentiment validates the shift in the kids beverage market: an Ipsos poll of 1,500 U.S. parents found that 58% are willing to switch brands if sugar grams exceed classroom guidelines, even when price parity does not exist. However, taste remains uncompromised territory; 41% of children aged eight to ten reported “off” aftertaste with first-generation stevia drinks, pushing brands toward next-gen Reb-M and fermented sweeteners that mimic sucrose perception curves. Shelf tags now carry traffic-light icons—green for <5 g, yellow for 5–7 g—implemented by Albertsons in 327 stores, nudging parents at point of sale. Looking forward, tooth-friendly certifications from the American Dental Association and on-pack glycemic-index scores could become differentiators, suggesting that cross-functional R&D teams must synchronize sensory science, regulatory affairs, and marketing to safeguard repeat purchase in an increasingly sugar-averse retail environment. Value-based pricing tiers evolve alongside private label and premium launches Inflationary pressure hit family grocery budgets hard in the kids beverage market, yet the kids beverage category proved resilient by stretching across multiple price ladders. NielsenIQ 52-week data to March 2024 show that unit volumes in the sub-$3 six-pack tier rose 5%, led by Walmart’s Great Value Fruit Punch and Dollar General’s Clover Valley Juice Drinks. Conversely, $1.99 “better-for-you” single-serve bottles—think GoodSport Kids Electrolyte Water—registered a 17% upswing, illustrating K-shaped growth where value and premium both flourish. Notably, private label moved beyond me-too offerings: H-E-B’s Splashers+ includes 30% real fruit and 100% daily vitamin C, competing head-to-head with branded options at a 20% discount. Premiumization thrives on experiential cues in the US kids beverage market. Recyclable aluminum stubby bottles priced at $2.49 each, pioneered by PathWater Kids, signal both quality and eco-values. Parents surveyed by Mintel assign a “social currency” rating of 7.8/10 to premium packs visible in lunchboxes, indicating willingness to trade up for perceived status. Dynamic pricing analytics used by Kroger Precision Marketing reveal that promotional elasticity is two-times higher in households with annual incomes above $120 k, encouraging personalized digital coupons rather than across-the-board discounts. Operators should therefore deploy granular shopper-affinity data: spotlight rock-bottom value packs in food-insecure ZIP codes while upselling functional glass-bottle SKUs through Instacart in affluent suburbs. This bifurcated approach guards margin integrity while preserving volume, a balancing act essential for decision makers aligning portfolio breadth with the diverse economic realities of 2024. Innovative packaging boosts convenience, safety, and recycling participation rates nationwide Packaging has evolved from mere container to value-adding feature in the United States kids beverage market. Tetra Pak’s 2024 School Edge report notes that 54% of administrators now require tethered caps to reduce litter—technology first scaled by Kool-Aid Bursts Reload. Breathing valve pouches, such as those used by Slammers Chill’n, cut choking risk and meet ASTM F963-17 toy safety standards, a specification now embedded in Walmart’s Supplier Playbook. In parallel, spouted pouches with 30% post-consumer recycled (PCR) content have surged 41% in distribution; they not only reduce pack weight by 70% versus PET but also appeal to eco-conscious Gen-Alpha who routinely learn about recycling in school curricula. Smart packaging amplifies consumer engagement in the kids beverage market. Yakult Kids rolled out NFC-enabled labels that deliver augmented-reality games teaching gut-health facts, driving 2.3 minutes of average dwell time per scan. Meanwhile, Boxed Water Is Better Kids prints QR codes linking to carbon-offset certificates, reinforcing transparency as a brand pillar. Operationally, flat-bottom pouch formats achieve 12% higher pallet density, cutting freight emissions and enabling cost savings passed along in the form of bundle promotions—three packs for $5, a hit at Costco. Looking ahead, compostable high-barrier films from Futamura and Mold-Tek’s in-mold label cups promise to marry shelf life with circularity. Packaging engineers should therefore collaborate early with recycling-stream stakeholders to ensure that novel substrates are recognized by U.S. material recovery facilities, safeguarding claims and avoiding greenwashing accusations that can erode parental trust.

Amazon reigns online with a 46% share of digital kids-drink dollars, but brand-owned sites are scaling: Hint Kids Water grew its subscription base 55% YOY, boasting a churn rate below 6%. Grocery curbside pickup also matters—Albertsons’ DriveUp & Go logged a 23% lift in multipack flavored waters, fueled by “buy again” one-tap algorithms that simplify replenishment for busy parents. Last-mile efficiency underlies profitability in the kids beverage market. C-store delivery via DoorDash and Gopuff accounted for 11% of single-serve juice unit sales during post-school “3 p.m. spike” windows, an untapped exposure point for trial. Cold-chain integrity tech, like Vericool’s plant-fiber insulation, maintains 34–38 °F for eight hours, expanding the viable radius for perishable smoothies. Retail media networks (RMNs) close the loop: Kroger’s DSP can target ads to households that previously bought toddler purées, then measure incremental basket lift within 48 hours—capability that convinced Danone to double RMN spend in 2024. For decision makers, marrying DTC margins with omnichannel scale demands SKU rationalization: offer flavor variety packs online where digital shelf is unlimited, yet focus brick-and-mortar slots on velocity leaders to avoid out-of-stock fines. Seamless inventory visibility, order-management systems, and in-app loyalty hooks will determine who captures the at-home convenience dollar in the next growth wave.

Title: Trump’s Tariff Threat To Hollywood Sparks More Questions Than Answers

ByMegan Poinski andCFO ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCFO, Forbes Staff. The Hollywood Sign seen in 2023 President Donald Trump declared Sunday night that his latest tariff target is the film industry. A post on his social network Truth Social said, “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” adding other countries’ incentives for filming movies—which often draw production to other shores—constitutes “a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!” Trump’s directive: Authorizing the Commerce Department and U.S. Trade Representative to “begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.” Most people involved in the entertainment industry responded the same way: With a big question mark. It’s not clear what Trump is targeting: Films for U.S. audiences shot on location elsewhere? Foreign films with global distribution, like South Korea’s Parasite, the 2020 Best Picture Oscar winner? And are these just films for theatrical release or would it include movies and series made for streaming networks? Where and how would this tariff be applied? If enacted, this kind of tariff could deeply impact the film industry. Many of the last decade’s top grossing movies were made outside of the U.S. Investors sharply pulled back as markets opened on Monday, with Netflix initially seeing its stock drop 4% and losing $20.4 billion market capitalization—almost the total current value of Warner Bros. Discovery. The stock market closed with smaller losses for Netflix and other entertainment companies, including Disney and Paramount Global, but no more clarity on these potential tariffs from the White House. Not often one to agree with Trump, California Gov. Gavin Newsom entered the discussion Monday with his own proposal: The state would collaborate with the federal government to enact a $7.5 billion incentive program to help domestic movie production. It’s unclear if the White House will discuss the matter with Newsom. On Monday, Trump called Newsom a “grossly incompetent governor that allowed” the movie business to go to other countries. And it also remains to be seen if this proposal will advance. (After all, the Truth Social post that started the discussion was made half an hour after Trump used the social media platform to endorse reopening San Francisco’s Alcatraz as a federal prison, which got this response from Newsom to CBS Sacramento: “You can’t even come up with a more colossally bad fiscal idea.”) What it does show are two different approaches to the common goal of building domestic industry. Trump is reaching for tariffs, while Newsom is proposing incentives. Each has benefits and drawbacks, not least of which is the immediate response from industry and investors. How the issue plays out—if at all—will show the way policy and business intermingle, and what truly works today. Protecting data and advancing cybersecurity isn’t just the CIO’s responsibility, especially given how vital that information is to making future projections—and how costly data breaches can be. I talked to Abhesh Kumar, chief technology officer at financial advisory firm Springline Advisory, about how CFOs and CIOs can come together. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. A trader looks at different stock indexes on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at the ... More opening bell in New York City, on May 6, 2025. Last week, the markets fully recovered from the “Liberation Day” tariff announcement crash, with the S&P 500 seeing its longest winning streak since 2004. Investors were encouraged by better job growth than expected—177,000 non-farm jobs added from March to April, beating expectations of 133,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics—and better-than-expected earnings reports from Big Tech, including Microsoft, Meta and Amazon. Inflation in March also moderated, according to Commerce Department data released last week, with the personal consumption expenditures index up 2.3% from last year, and core inflation—excluding food and energy costs—matching estimates of 2.6% in March. Even though these are positive metrics, they don’t necessarily indicate a recovering economy. While stocks have recovered from their low point in early April, markets are still down since Donald Trump’s presidency began in late January—the S&P is now 5% lower. According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump’s first 100 days in office have been the worst for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 since President Richard Nixon’s second term in 1973. While there was more job growth than expected, a report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that layoffs are way up—April’s cuts were up 63% compared to a year ago, and the more than 600,000 layoffs so far in 2025 are 87% higher than at this point in 2024. The firm found that 48% of the layoffs were tied to cuts made by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Forbes senior contributor Teresa Ghilarducci found troubling signs for employment underneath the strong job creation numbers. Worker confidence is down: 11.8% of the unemployed had left their jobs, down from 13.2% in January. Payroll numbers only increased by 0.3%, though inflation is much higher. Long-term unemployment is on the rise—1.9% of unemployed people have been without work for 15 weeks or longer, up from 1.4% in January. The economy as a whole also contracted significantly in the first quarter. According to the Bureau of Economic Research, GDP was down 0.3% compared with the last three months of 2024. That’s a drop from steady previous growth—GDP was up 2.4% in Q4—and the weakest growth since Q1 of 2022. Much of the drop in GDP came from fewer imports, as sweeping tariffs loom. And while the Trump administration has touted deals in progress—including talks to reduce a 145% tariff on China—nothing has been announced and Beijing says it is evaluating whether to negotiate. Tariffs are already reducing the amounts of goods shipped to the U.S. from China, setting the stage for fewer items on shelves in coming months, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Last week, the Trump Administration also eliminated the de minimis trade exemption, which allowed low-cost items from online retailers, including Temu and Shein, to be shipped to the U.S. duty-free. Now, items from those retailers are seeing a 145% tariff, more than doubling prices for U.S. consumers. Meanwhile, several companies anticipating a negative impact from tariffs for the rest of the year have reduced their estimates or pulled guidance. Pedestrians walk past the American lifestyle and performance footwear brand Skechers store in Hong ... More Kong. Skechers, the U.S.’s third-largest footwear company by sales, will be acquired by private equity firm 3G Capital in a deal worth $9.4 billion. The deal will take the publicly traded company private, and is expected to close later this year. CEO and cofounder Robert Greenberg will remain in that role and continue to lead the company’s strategy, but he and his family will make $1.1 billion on the sale, writes Forbes’ Jemima McEvoy and Matt Durot. Last week, as part of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, Skechers signed a letter to Trump saying that tariffs posed an “existential threat” to the footwear industry, arguing that U.S. consumers would be unable to bear increased costs for shoes and that tens of thousands of industry jobs were on the line. A source close to the deal told CNBC that the timing and nature of the acquisition have nothing to do with tariffs and the current situation; 3G Capital has had its eye on Skechers as an acquisition target for some time. A sign outside of IRS headquarters in Washington, DC. The Trump Administration’s deep cuts to federal government employees have removed 11% of the workforce at the IRS so far, according to a report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb. The cuts are not spread evenly across the agency. Nearly a third of all revenue agents—usually CPAs who audit tax returns—who were there in January have been cut. About 18% of revenue officers, who focus on collections, are no longer there. About half of employees who are no longer at the IRS worked with small businesses and self-employed entities. Springline Advisory CTO Abhesh Kumar In today’s business world, data and cybersecurity threats are always multiplying. Abhesh Kumar, chief technology officer at financial advisory firm Springline Advisory, sees one way to strengthen both a company’s use and understanding of data and its security: Having finance and data or technology leaders work together on it. I talked to him about why this is an important partnership and how to make it work. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. What can help fill gaps in knowledge about data between CFOs and CIOs? Kumar: Both CTOs and CFOs need to take joint ownership as stewards of data assets. While technology [departments have] always taken the role of protecting all the data, in forward-leaning organizations such as Springline, CFOs are now embedding cybersecurity and data protection as part of their financial risk management. This is now getting recognized that the reputational risk, the compliance risk, and, frankly, the financial risk that could arise out of a lack of data protection could greatly cross even some of the more traditional forms of risk. This awareness comes back to the CTO or CIO and CFO working very closely and collaboratively as joint stakeholders in data protection and vulnerability management. There’s a cultural angle to it. Often CTOs and CFOs exist in siloed worlds. Leading by example and making joint appearances at the board level, where you’re seen as co-equal stakeholders in being the stewards of managing the protection of data assets, also drives a behavior down the chain of working in tandem and building that cohesion, which eventually reduces the blind spots for everybody. Some of the other things from a practical perspective will be proactive monitoring of threats and a proactive approach toward training and developing skill: Anti-phishing training, anti-social engineering trainings, deploying cybersecurity not as a one-off measure but embedding it into your business processes so that you are designing the system with cybersecurity at the front-and-center of your approach. With increased communication and collaboration, the chances of security being seen as a trade off between collaboration or innovation starts to blur, and a middle part starts to emerge where you can actually have the best of both words. You can be fairly agile and nimble in your business processes without really compromising or taking on non-compliance risk. A recent study from KPMG looking at the dynamic between CFOs and CIOs found that they both claim ownership of things dealing with data and tech, but have different viewpoints on what it’s for and why they’re doing it. Do you see this kind of difference of perception as an impediment to working together? I do not necessarily see it as an impediment. I actually see it as an opportunity to bring two diverse points of view together on a problem that will have collective impact on both stakeholders. The CFO and the CTO, it’s given that they have slightly different KPIs. Once they double-click and triple-click on some of the approaches towards protecting data assets, they will realize there’s rich and fertile ground for collaboration in elevating the data protection together. Technology risk can manifest itself in financial risk and damage, and financial risk can certainly bring down the technology pillar of the organization. I see it as a shared interest—even though both parties bring different points of view, but also different strengths and motivations to essentially do the right thing for the organization as a whole. That’s how I see it as an opportunity for collaboration. In fact, it’s all the more reason they should be collaborating, because the impact is greater on the whole than individuals. What advice would you give to a CFO to start working with their CIO or CTO in this manner? First, convince yourself that this is important, and talk to your CTO. Build that awareness of what the lack of good cybersecurity or data security procedures translates into dollar terms. CFOs understand dollar terms very clearly, and CTOs have to step up and be able to translate that risk. This is part of that collaboration: They need to make it easy for the CFO to understand because it is not just the loss of data. It’s the value of that data, plus reputational risk, compliance risk, disclosure risk for your clients. The CFO must understand the actual dollar impact of this risk, and then lead by example. CFO could be seen as a champion of cybersecurity by taking on an executive sponsor role for some of these defense mechanisms like training. That sends a message across the organization that this is something at the very senior level that’s being taken by the CFO. In return, the CFO gets enhanced security, enhanced visibility of the data and a close partnership with the technology department that protects their crown jewels. Legendary Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett unexpectedly announced over the weekend he would be stepping back from leading the firm at the end of the year, and plans to hand the company’s reins to Berkshire Hathaway Energy CEO Greg Abel. 1965: Year Buffett became Berkshire’s CEO 19.9%: Berkshire’s compounded annual gain from 1965 to 2024, nearly doubling the S&P 500’s 10.4% annual return ‘Just keep making the most of it’: Buffett’s advice to Berkshire shareholders, telling them they are already fortunate to be part of the U.S. It’s National Small Business Week, and this size of enterprise has many financial rules and regulations to comply with. In this week’s Forbes Tax Breaks newsletter, senior writer Kelly Phillips Erb goes over what small businesses need to know, and where they can learn more and get advice. If used properly, AI can make you a better leader and take on tasks ranging from complex analytical calculations to improving communication with employees. Here are some ways it can help many aspects of your business leadership. Which health insurance company announced last week it was leaving the Obamacare individual coverage business next year? A.

Title: Trump's tariffs are scrambling businesses' ability to predict what happens next

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time President Donald Trump’s tariffs rollout is frustrating U.S. companies’ planning for the rest of the year, preventing some corporate giants from telling investors what to expect and scrambling the broader outlook for stocks. Mattel and Ford each suspended their 2025 financial forecasts on Monday. The toy giant told investors that “given the volatile macroeconomic environment and evolving U.S. tariff landscape, it is difficult to predict consumer spending and Mattel’s U.S. sales in the remainder of the year and holiday season.” The company said that Barbie and Hot Wheels, its two flagship brands, were mostly manufactured outside of China, which faces a 145% effective tariff rate from the Trump administration. Still, CEO Ynon Kreiz told CNBC on Tuesday morning that Mattel was considering hiking prices for U.S. consumers to offset the costs of tariffs, which it estimated could come to about $270 million. “Where necessary, we will be taking pricing action in the U.S.,” Kreiz said. Mattel shares have declined by about 25% since February, when Trump first began discussing tariffs in greater detail. By comparison, the broader S&P 500 fell about 8% over the same period. “The shape of the toy industry has really changed,” said Brian Benway, senior tech and gaming analyst at the market research firm Mintel, who noted that Mattel’s products are increasingly sold in big-box retailers that are vulnerable to supply-chain snarls. The company said during its earnings call that it was prepared to increase direct imports to help stores keep shelves stocked. “Could we spin up more U.S.-based production? Yes. Will it be in the next five to 10 years? Probably not,” Benway said. Ford, too, put its outlook for the year on hold this week, citing lack of clarity about potential retaliatory tariffs from other countries, as well as how consumers may react to price increases. It joined other automakers including Dodge and Ram maker Stellantis, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz in pulling its annual guidance. Ford CEO Jim Farley warned the company’s hit from tariffs would be “huge.” Ford builds several models in Mexico that are sold in the U.S., including the popular electric Mustang Mach-E, Maverick pickup truck and Bronco Sport. Trump has softened his stance on tariffs somewhat, but so far no trade deals have materialized. That has left large and small companies alike facing tremendous uncertainty over how much the trade duties could hit their bottom lines. Meanwhile, Trump has continued to downplay the potential impact to consumers from tariffs despite campaigning on immediate economic relief. He told NBC News’ Kristen Welker on Sunday that Americans should in some cases be making do with less. “I’m just saying [Americans] don’t need to have 30 dolls, they can have three,” he said. “They don’t need to have 250 pencils,” he said. “They can have five.” Other companies are issuing multiple forecasts that take into account different economic scenarios. United Airlines said last month that “a single consensus no longer exists, and therefore the Company’s expectation has become bimodal — either the U.S. economy will remain weaker but stable, or the U.S. may enter into a recession.” Most other major airlines, including American, Delta and JetBlue, also either warned of lower earnings or suspended some guidance. Even some tech companies, many of which were thought to be largely immune from tariffs, signaled they could no longer forecast near-term financial results. That includes Snapchat parent Snap, which declined to issue guidance for the second quarter. But so far, stock investors have been relatively sanguine about the growing chorus of companies admitting they cannot navigate the current environment. Last week, the S&P 500 returned to the level it had reached before Trump gave his “Liberation Day” speech on April 2, after suffering weeks of heavy losses, though the index ended Monday in the red and was off to a rough start again Tuesday. “This is a tricky time for investors,” Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius said in a recent note to clients. “While the economy has held up a touch better than expected so far, it’s very early.” All things considered, he said, the recent rally is likely to dissipate in the face of what are likely to be “significant price hikes, supply chain disruptions, and job losses.” Other major companies reporting earnings this week include Disney, Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International, Warner Bros. Discovery and Uber. Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com. J.J.

Title: China Market Update: Post-Holiday Rebound Driven By Consumer Stocks

ByBrendan Ahern ByBrendan Ahern, Senior Contributor. CLN Asian equities were mixed overnight as Hong Kong and Mainland China returned from holiday refreshed and in good spirits (similar to how I feel post-vacation), and Indonesia outperformed while Thailand underperformed. Japan was closed for Greenery Day, a holiday “dedicated to appreciating nature and expressing gratitude for its blessings.” South Korea was closed for Vesak Day, which is also Buddha’s Birthday. Hong Kong and Mainland China were driven higher by green shoots in U.S.-China trade talks last Friday and over the weekend, as well as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s positive comments yesterday. Asian currencies have made monster moves versus the U.S. dollar. The Taiwan dollar is up +7.29% and the offshore CNY (CNH) is up +0.96% since April 28. The Chinese people were on the move during the May Day holiday, with 101.7 million railway passengers and 11.15 million airline passengers, while 10.896 million foreigners visited China, according to Mainland media sources. According to the South China Morning Post, people opened their wallets, with 60,000 auto trade-in subsidy applications. Meanwhile, home appliance sales during the holiday were up +15.5% year-over-year, auto sales were up +13.7% YoY, communication equipment sales were up+10.5% YoY, and home and apartment sales data appear strong in the top 30 major cities. The April Caixin Services PMI was 50.7 versus expectations of 51.8 and March’s 51.9 as the month-over-month indicator declines from tariff front running. Hong Kong soft technology (internet), airlines, hotels, restaurants, and Macau casino stocks outperformed overnight. Hardware technology stocks, including biotechnology, and semiconductors, underperformed, led by index heavyweight Xiaomi, which was down -2.92%. Mainland investors bought a healthy $1.7 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs today as Meituan and Alibaba saw an inflow, while Tencent saw a small outflow. From a breadth perspective, Mainland China had a very strong day led by growth stocks, with 4,677 advancing stocks and only 396 declining stocks. Unlike Hong Kong, hard technology stocks had a very strong day, led by electronic equipment, semiconductors, software, and travel and consumer plays, such as airlines. Hopefully, the positive momentum continues! Investor’s Business Daily had an insightful article over the weekend titled, “The Trade War Comes Ashore,” providing a timeline of the coming tariff tsunami effect on store shelves and retail employment. Maritime consulting firm Drewry anticipates 2025 cargo volumes will decline for only the third time since 1979. The only two declines were the 2009 Global Financial Crisis and the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Apollo Global Management believes that domestic freight and retail companies will begin layoffs by early June as “most retailers will have run through their stockpiled inventory.” Companies anticipating inventory issues mentioned in the article include Amazon, Target, and Walmart, though the list is far more expansive. Even if the U.S. and China governments make significant progress over the next few weeks, the American people will likely discover how reliant and intertwined our two economies are. I suspect most Americans don’t want their kids working in low-end manufacturing versus high-end manufacturing and innovation industries (brain versus brawn industries). Obviously, there are things that should be made here in the U.S. for national security reasons, but the vast majority of what is made in China and Asia more broadly and sold in U.S. stores doesn’t fit that criteria. Ultimately, not even politicians can overpower economic laws, just as President Hoover and Senators Smoot and Hawley learned nearly a century ago.

Title: Rite Aid files for bankruptcy a second time

Rite Aid on Monday announced it is filing for bankruptcy for a second time, barely just seven months after the chain exited Chapter 11 and emerged as a private company. The financially strapped drug store chain said it is looking for a buyer, and re-filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection will help facilitate that process. The company said it would keep its stores open throughout its bankruptcy. “While we have continued to face financial challenges, intensified by the rapidly evolving retail and healthcare landscapes in which we operate, we are encouraged by meaningful interest from a number of potential national and regional strategic acquirors,” said Matt Schroeder, Rite Aid’s CEO, in a statement. “As we move forward, our key priorities are ensuring uninterrupted pharmacy services for our customers and preserving jobs for as many associates as possible.” Rite Aid first filed for bankruptcy in October 2023, becoming a casualty of a miserable environment for drug stores, exacerbated by its runner-up status to bigger chains and expensive legal battles for allegedly filling unlawful opioid prescriptions that pushed its debt to nearly $4 billion. It took about a year to navigate the Chapter 11 process, finally emerging in September 2024 by slashing $2 billion in debt, securing $2.5 billion in funds to keep operating, and the closure of about 500 locations. On Monday, Rite Aid said it secured nearly $2 billion in new financing to keep it operational during its bankruptcy. Rite Aid is a distant third-largest nationwide standalone pharmacy chain in the United States — and the seventh largest pharmacy overall, when taking into account big box chains. It has about 1,250 stores remaining — roughly half of the number it had just two years ago. It was offered a $17 billion lifeline in 2015 when Walgreens offered to buy the chain. But the deal was met with stiff scrutiny from US regulators who feared the combination would violate federal antitrust laws and reduce competition in the drug store market. Ultimately, in 2017, the companies agreed to a smaller, $4.4 billion deal, in which Walgreens bought just under 2,000 Rite Aid locations, leaving Rite Aid diminished in stature and unable to compete at the scale of its bigger rivals. Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData, a data analytics company, said he was not surprised by Rite Aid’s second bankruptcy, since the drug store chain hasn’t been able to secure enough inventory to keep shelves stocked. “The first bankruptcy did little to resolve the chain’s issues, and it has been teetering on the edge of survival for quite some time,” Saunders said. With Walgreens no longer in a position to buy Rite Aid outright, the most likely outcome is that other drug store and retail chains will “cherry pick” individual Rite Aid stores to purchase and keep open, Saunders said. Rite Aid’s bankruptcy comes amid struggles for its rivals, too. Walgreens Boots Alliance announced in March that it’s being taken private in a deal valued up to $24 billion, following a largely disastrous run on the public markets where its market cap has lost billions and more than 1,200 of its locations have closed or plan to close. The transaction is expected to be finalized later this year. At CVS, the chain has closed more than 1,000 stores and undergone thousands of layoffs over the past several months. The company is experimenting with a new, smaller-format store that only focuses on the pharmacy rather than the retail part. All three chains have struggled with declining prescription reimbursements in recent years, sending its value plummeting to just around $9.5 billion from $100 billion a decade ago. They have also all become ubiquitous and over-expanded, with the chains becoming synonymous with convenience stores, giving people the option to pick-up their medication and perhaps grab something else, too. However, they’ve struggled to keep up with Amazon, Target and other retailers and have also had issues with theft, which has chipped away their profitability.

Title: Hollywood is the latest industry to get skittish about Trump's tariffs

Good morning! Some of the world's elite gathered for the Met Gala last night. (My invite must have got lost in the mail.) Here's a rundown on how the event went. We also made our picks for who was the best-dressed — and who missed the mark. In today's big story, President Donald Trump has targeted movies made outside the US with his latest tariffs, but no one really knows what it means. I know your inbox is already pretty full, but you're going to want to make room for this. Tech Memo, a weekly BI newsletter from Alistair Barr on what's happening at the world's most powerful tech companies, is launching soon. Subscribe here! What's on deck Markets: Warren Buffett's retirement announcement was a downer for Berkshire Hathaway's stock. Tech: Former Meta employees shared what it was like to be laid off as "low performers." Business: Austin is the first battleground for Tesla and Waymo's driverless taxis to face off. But first, lights! Cameras! Tariffs! If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. EXT: PORT OF NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY - DAY A walking film reel departs from a European container ship and approaches a customs officer awaiting exiting passengers. FILM REEL Hello! I'm the new summer blockbuster, and I'm ready for the big screen! CUSTOMS AGENT Not until you pay up on these tariffs! My first attempt at screenwriting might not make sense, but the same could be said for President Donald Trump's latest tariff announcement focused on Hollywood. On Sunday, the president said he'd save Hollywood from "dying a very fast death" due to productions shifting out of the country by imposing a 100% tariff on movies made outside the US. The problem, as Business Insider's Peter Kafka points out in this piece, is that no one quite understands what putting tariffs on films made outside the US means or how it would work. Trump isn't wrong that tax incentives and labor costs have led Hollywood to look overseas. But how would one enforce these tariffs? What level of work done on a movie outside the US would trigger the tariffs? And, as my short film above illustrates, how do you even tariff something that doesn't physically arrive here via cargo ships or planes? (You can read more about Peter's theories here. Hint: Tax breaks and other financial incentives.) Trump said Monday afternoon he was "not looking to hurt the industry; I'm looking to help." What's not debatable was the industry's initial reaction. Shares of top streamers and movie companies like Netflix and Walt Disney took a dip Monday morning. Maybe the best way to understand these latest tariffs is to look at them more holistically. At least, that was the pitch from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday at the Milken conference, where BI's Bradley Saacks was in attendance. In front of a crowd of the world's biggest and most powerful asset managers, Bessent made the case that the administration's overall trade plans were part of a three-pronged approach. Tariffs, tax cuts, and deregulation work together "to solidify our position as the home of global capital," Bessent told the group. The framing was meant to help investors digest the volatile first 100 days of Trump's presidency, thanks largely to his focus on tariffs. Carlyle CEO Harvey Schwartz and Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson, who followed Bessent's speech, said tying together tariffs with deregulation and tax cuts was a good way to articulate Trump's broader plan. Whether the rest of the attendees agreed remains to be seen. 1. It's time to start rooting for the rich. The wealthy don't like higher prices, but they're spending through it. Their buying habits are holding up the consumer-driven US economy — but if they start to cut back, everyone else will feel the contraction. 2. Berkshire Hathaway's stock tumbles on Buffett news. The conglomerate's stock dropped as much as 7% on Monday after Warren Buffett announced his retirement over the weekend. Shareholders are wondering what Berkshire will look like without Buffett at the helm. 3. Elite colleges are rushing to the bond market. MIT plans to sell $750 million worth of taxable bonds, according to May 2 preliminary offering documents. It joins a list of elite colleges that have tapped the bond market as the Trump administration threatens to slash federal funding for universities. 1. Meta's "low performers" on those brutal layoffs. Eight former employees told BI what it was like to be caught in the company's sweeping job cuts — and the stigma that comes with being labeled a "low performer." 2. Amazon rewards consistently high performers. The retail giant is revamping its pay structure to better recognize and reward long-term high performers, per internal guidelines obtained by BI. The compensation overhaul reflects a wider trend happening across Big Tech. 3. Microsoft's controversial management approach. The software giant is putting some ousted low performers on a two-year rehiring ban and identifies these job cuts as "good attrition," according to an internal document viewed by BI. It's similar to hardcore performance-management strategies used at Meta and Amazon. 1. Tesla vs. Waymo. The two companies' driverless taxis will go head-to-head in Austin in June, when Tesla launches its services in the city. Here's how the robotaxis compare on cost, training, business strategy, and more. 2. OpenAI says its nonprofit will remain in control after all. In September, the AI giant announced it was moving to a for-profit business model. Read the letter CEO Sam Altman sent to employees explaining the decision to reverse course. 3. Google wants the star power. The tech company quietly launched a film and TV production initiative called 100 Zeros, BI has learned. Google hopes 100 Zeros will boost its image among Gen Z, but it plans to skip out on YouTube as a distributor. President Trump hosts Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the White House.

Business U.S. meal delivery firm DoorDash will buy Deliveroo in a deal valuing the British rival at about 2.9 billion pounds ($3.85 billion), the companies said, banking on a bigger reach and local expertise to take on competition. Separately on Tuesday, DoorDash said it would buy SevenRooms, a New York City-based hospitality-related software company, for about $1.2 billion. The company's spending spree comes at a time when similar businesses have struggled to add scale with consumers being mindful about spending on pricey food delivery services. Both the companies rekindled talks last month after DoorDash approached Deliveroo with a 180 pence per share proposal, which was confirmed on Tuesday as the final offer, sending Deliveroo shares up about 2 per cent.

Large AI Overviews on SERPs are affecting visibility and causing a dramatic decrease in traffic. Effective faceted navigation can support SEO – if implemented correctly. Learn how to avoid index bloat, crawl issues, and ranking setbacks. This week’s question tackles the potential SEO fallouts when implementing faceted navigation: “How can ecommerce sites implement SEO-friendly faceted navigation without hurting crawl efficiency or creating index bloat?” Faceted navigation is a game-changer for user experience (UX) on large ecommerce sites. It helps users quickly narrow down what they’re looking for, whether it’s a size 8 pair of red road running trainers for women, or a blue, waterproof winter hiking jacket for men. For your customers, faceted navigation makes huge inventories feel manageable and, when done right, enhances both UX and SEO. However, when these facets create a new URL for every possible filter combination, they can lead to significant SEO issues that harm your rankings, and waste valuable crawl budget if not managed properly. Faceted navigation issues often fly under the radar – until they start causing real SEO damage. The good news? You don’t need to be a tech wizard to spot the early warning signs. With the right tools and a bit of detective work, you can uncover whether filters are bloating your site, wasting crawl budget, or diluting rankings. Here’s a step-by-step approach to auditing your site for faceted SEO issues: Start by searching on Google with this query: site:yourdomain.com. This will show you all the URLs Google has indexed for your site. Review the list: If so, you may have index bloat. Check Google Search Console (GSC) for a clearer picture. Look under “Coverage” to see how many pages are indexed. Pay attention to the “Indexed, not submitted in sitemap” section for unintended filter-generated pages. Not all faceted navigation behaves the same. Make sure you understand how filters work on your site: Some faceted pages drive traffic; others burn crawl budget without returns. Use tools like Botify, Screaming Frog, or Ahrefs to compare Googlebot’s crawling behavior with actual organic visits. If a page gets crawled a lot but doesn’t attract visitors, it’s a sign that it’s consuming crawl resources unnecessarily. Run a crawler to scan your site’s URLs. Check for repetitive patterns, such as endless combinations of parameters like ?price=low&sort=best-sellers. These are potential crawler traps and unnecessary variations. To decide which SEO tactics to use for faceted navigation, assess the search demand for specific filters and whether unique content can be created for those variations. Use keyword research tools like Google Keyword Planner or Ahrefs to check for user demand for specific filter combinations. For example: This helps prioritize which facet combinations should be indexed. If there’s enough value in targeting a specific query, such as product features, a dedicated URL may be worthwhile. However, low-value filters like price or size should remain no-indexed to avoid bloated indexing. The decision should balance the effort needed to create new URLs against the potential SEO benefits. Log files record every request, including those from search engine bots. By analyzing them, you can track which URLs Googlebot is crawling and how often, helping you identify wasted crawl budget on low-value pages. For example, if Googlebot is repeatedly crawling deep-filtered URLs like /jackets?size=large&brand=ASICS&price=100-200&page=12 with little traffic, that’s a red flag. Key signs of inefficiency include: By regularly checking your logs, you get a clear picture of Googlebot’s behavior, enabling you to optimize crawl budget and focus Googlebot’s attention on more valuable pages. Here’s how to keep things under control, so your site stays crawl-efficient and search-friendly. Start with the basics: Your facet labels should be intuitive. “Blue,” “Leather,” “Under £200” – these need to make instant sense to your users. Confusing or overly technical terms can lead to a frustrating experience and missed conversions. Not sure what resonates? Check out competitor sites and see how they’re labeling similar filters. Just because you can add 30 different filters doesn’t mean you should. Too many options can overwhelm users and generate thousands of unnecessary URL combinations. Stick to what genuinely helps customers narrow down their search. If your platform allows it, use clean, readable URLs for facets like /sofas/blue rather than messy query strings like ?color[blue]. Reserve query parameters for optional filters (e.g., sort order or availability), and don’t index those. Use canonical tags to point similar or filtered pages back to the main category/parent page. This helps consolidate link equity and avoid duplicate content issues. Just remember, canonical tags are suggestions, not commands. Google may ignore them if your filtered pages appear too different or are heavily linked internally. For any faceted pages you want indexed, these should include a self-referencing canonical, and for any that don’t, canonicalize these to the parent page. Break your URLs into three clear groups: No matter the order in which users apply filters, the resulting URL should be consistent. For example, /trainers/blue/leather and /trainers/leather/blue should result in the same URL, or else you’ll end up with duplicate content that dilutes SEO value. One way to reduce unnecessary crawling is by blocking faceted URLs through your robots.txt file. That said, it’s important to know that robots.txt is more of a polite request than a strict rule. Search engines like Google typically respect it, but not all bots do, and some may interpret the syntax differently. To prevent search engines from crawling pages you don’t want indexed, it’s also smart to ensure those pages aren’t linked to internally or externally (e.g., backlinks). If search engines find value in those pages through links, they might still crawl or index them, even with a disallow rule in place. Here’s a basic example of how to block a faceted URL pattern using the robots.txt file. Suppose you want to stop crawlers from accessing URLs that include a color parameter: User-agent: * Disallow: /*color* In this rule: However, if your faceted navigation requires a more nuanced approach, such as blocking most color options but allowing specific ones, you’ll need to mix Disallow and Allow rules. For instance, to block all color parameters except for “black,” your file might include: User-agent: * Disallow: /*color* Allow: /*color=black* A word of caution: This strategy only works well if your URLs follow a consistent structure. Without clear patterns, it becomes harder to manage, and you risk accidentally blocking key pages or leaving unwanted URLs crawlable. If you’re working with complex URLs or an inconsistent setup, consider combining this with other techniques like meta noindex tags or parameter handling in Google Search Console. Internal links signal importance to search engines. So, if you link frequently to faceted URLs that are canonicalized or blocked, you’re sending mixed signals. Consider using rel=”nofollow” on links you don’t want crawled – but be cautious. Google treats nofollow as a hint, not a rule, so results may vary. Point to only canonical URLs within your website wherever possible. This includes dropping parameters and slugs from links that are not necessary for your URLs to work. You should also prioritize pillar pages; the more inlinks a page has, the more authoritative search engines will deem that page to be. In 2019, Google’s John Mueller said: “In general, we ignore everything after hash… So things like links to the site and the indexing, all of that will be based on the non hash URL. And if there are any links to the hashed URL, then we will fold up into the non hash URL.” Track which filters users actually engage with, and which lead to conversions. If no one ever uses the “beige” filter, it may not deserve crawlable status. Use tools like Google Analytics 4 or Hotjar to see what users care about and streamline your navigation accordingly. When a filtered page returns no results, respond with a 404 status, unless it’s a temporary out-of-stock issue, in which case show a friendly message stating so, and return a 200. This helps avoid wasting crawl budget on thin content. When you interact with a page – say, filtering a product list, selecting a color, or typing in a live search box – AJAX lets the site fetch or send data behind the scenes, so the rest of the page stays put. It can be really effective to implement facets client-side via AJAX, which doesn’t create multiple URLs for every filter change. This reduces unnecessary load on the server and improves performance. Faceted navigation often leads to large sets of results, which naturally introduces pagination (e.g., ?category=shoes&page=2). But when combined with layered filters, these paginated URLs can balloon into thousands of crawlable variations. Left unchecked, this can create serious crawl and index bloat, wasting search engine resources on near-duplicate pages. So, should paginated URLs be indexed? In most cases, no. Pages beyond the first page rarely offer unique value or attract meaningful traffic, so it’s best to prevent them from being indexed while still allowing crawlers to follow links. The standard approach here is to use noindex, follow on all pages after page 1. This ensures your deeper pagination doesn’t get indexed, but search engines can still discover products via internal links. When it comes to canonical tags, you’ve got two options depending on the content. If pages 2, 3, and so on are simply continuations of the same result set, it makes sense to canonicalize them to page 1. This consolidates ranking signals and avoids duplication. However, if each paginated page features distinct content or meaningful differences, a self-referencing canonical might be the better fit. The key is consistency – don’t mix page 2 canonical to page 1 and page 3 to itself, for example. About rel=”next” and rel=”prev,” while Google no longer uses these signals for indexing, they still offer UX benefits and remain valid HTML markup. They also help communicate page flow to accessibility tools and browsers, so there’s no harm in including them. To help control crawl depth, especially in large ecommerce sites, it’s wise to combine pagination handling with other crawl management tactics: For example, a faceted URL like /trainers?color=white&brand=asics&page=3 would typically: Handling pagination well is just as important as managing the filters themselves. It’s all part of keeping your site lean, crawlable, and search-friendly. When properly managed, faceted navigation can be an invaluable tool for improving user experience, targeting long-tail keywords, and boosting conversions. However, without the right SEO strategy in place, it can quickly turn into a crawl efficiency nightmare that damages your rankings. By following the best practices outlined above, you can enjoy all the benefits of faceted navigation while avoiding the common pitfalls that often trip up ecommerce sites.

Title: Meta's layoffs were supposed to target low performers. These employees share how it felt to them.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-layoffs-low-performance-cuts-review-cycle-politics-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-05-06T09:00:01Z
Full Content:
Months after Meta's high-profile culling of low performers, the stigma associated with the job cuts still stings. CEO Mark Zuckerberg's push to "raise the bar on performance" saw about 5% of its workforce — roughly 3,600 employees — laid off in a sweeping round of cuts in February. The company said it targeted its lowest performers, but some former employees pushed back on that. Some said they had received positive ratings months earlier. Others said they were on medical or parental leave, mid-transfer between teams, or hadn't received a formal rating yet. Some speculated that conflict with a manager was the deciding factor. As of late April, laid-off employees received severance payouts. The eight accounts below offer a sense of how employees who were let go experienced the cuts and their concern about how it could affect their futures. BI has verified the performance records of these ex-workers, who asked for anonymity because they fear the "low performer" label could hurt future job prospects. A Meta spokesperson reiterated what the company previously shared with BI earlier this year about its low-performer cuts: "Let me be clear, these were performance-based terminations," the spokesperson said. "Prior ratings were not downgraded. Simply because someone had a history of meeting or exceeding expectations does not mean they continue to consistently meet the bar." The spokesperson added that Meta employees are held accountable to a goal-based culture of high performance. A former employee in Meta's human resources division had returned to work after being on parental leave for nearly five months when his division lost close to 10% of its staff. His midyear review put him "At or Above Expectations" — the middle tier — but his year-end rating was "Meets Most," which made him eligible for termination. "I tried calling my boss immediately, but in my heart, I knew it probably wasn't an error — Meta wouldn't make a mistake that significant." He said the manager was distressed but repeated: "I can't say anything. It's just part of Mark's mandate. It's a hard year." He said he didn't know why his rating had fallen. "We can't even see the feedback our managers wrote for us," he said. "Once the shock wore off, there was actually a mix of emotions — including some relief at being freed from that situation." But he does worry about carrying the low-performer label. "It's one thing to be let go in a restructuring," he said. "It's another to have your professional reputation potentially damaged by being mischaracterized as an underperformer." A former senior machine learning engineer at Meta described the shock of being laid off, only for a Meta recruiter to invite her to reapply three days later and skip the interview process. "Same email address. Same person. No acknowledgment of what had just happened. It felt surreal," she said. She said she joined Meta in early 2024 and earned a midyear review of "At or Above Expectations." Initially rated "Meets All Expectations" in the January 2025 year-end review, she was downgraded to "Meets Most Expectations" after a second round of director-level reviews. She said she suspects "directors were under pressure to hit a layoff quota." Before the layoff, she was dissatisfied with her manager and sought a transfer to a top-tier team. It was approved, but she was told the move could lower her rating, so she waited — only to be pink-slipped. She said she's not taking the recruiter up on her offer. Ultimately, she's confident she can land or create her next opportunity. "I'll be fine. I can get another job or start something of my own." This software engineer who joined Meta in May 2024 to work on cross-platform content sharing said a promising start unraveled because of internal politics over a new feature he prototyped. He said he took a four-month leave for burnout in August and returned in December to complete two more projects. Two weeks before the layoffs, he said, his new manager told the team everyone was "safe." Then came the termination email — and a performance rating of "Meets Some Expectations," low on Meta's end-of-year rating scale. "How could they evaluate my performance when I'd only worked 10 weeks in 2024?" he said, adding that an HR director had said he was "too new to evaluate." Although he's now fielding interest from other companies and expects to receive 16 weeks of severance, he still feels the sting of his rating. "The harmful 'low performer' label still feels wrong," he said. This product manager joined Facebook as a contractor in 2018, converted to full time in 2020, and consistently received a year-end "Greatly Exceeds Expectations" ratings label. In 2023, when she moved to Reality Labs, "everything changed," she said. "My manager would call late at night to question my capabilities and create doubt, even though teammates gave me positive feedback," she said. A review in early 2024 dropped her two tiers to "Meets All Expectations." Feedback included accusations that she was "blinded" by a "desire for promotion," she said. In August, she took a 12-week disability leave "because I was physically ill from all the stress." She returned in November and was laid off in February. She's being "selective" in her hunt for a new job. "The experience damaged my health, affected my family, and forced me onto medication for anxiety. I need to walk away from toxicity at the first sign, not wait until it affects my health and family again." A technical program manager was laid off after seven years of good performance ratings at Meta. A reorganization placed her under a new manager a few months earlier — a shift she felt exposed her. "When managers have to meet quotas and choose someone to cut, people with less history on the team are at higher risk," she said. "I contacted my manager in shock" after the termination notice, she said. "I just wanted five minutes to talk to ensure I wasn't going crazy." The manager responded with a templated email — the same company-approved language she had been required to use the day before when laying off her own direct report. She still doesn't know exactly what led to their selection. "Was it because I had significant equity vested when the stock price was low?" she said. " Was it because I expressed disappointment about Meta rolling back DEI programs on internal forums? I'll never know — but there's clearly more to this story than simply cutting the lowest performers." After 14 years at Google and three at Meta, a program manager said she was laid off despite a strong performance record: "At Meta, I'd even received 'Exceeds Expectations' and the rare 'Redefines Expectations.'" She said her manager told her she was doing "a great job" at the midyear review. "I was candid with my manager — sometimes critically, but always constructively — about where I thought things could improve," she said. "I was transparent about how stress in my personal life was affecting me: My husband had been laid off, and we were caring for a special-needs child." She said her manager told her not to worry, but she'd noticed a shift in tone at Meta — for example, when chief technology officer Andrew "Boz" Bosworth said a worker who alleged mistreatment should just quit. "The compassionate tone of the 2022 layoffs — the regret, the messaging about hard decisions — feels like a distant memory," she said. "This round was cutthroat. Silent. Cold. 'The Hunger Games,' but for high performers." "I wrote a final email to my skip-level manager," she added. "Not to get my job back. Not even to get a reply (I didn't). I just wanted to be heard. To say: I know I did good work. I know I didn't deserve this. And I hope someone — anyone — in leadership still has the humanity to care." This employee spent years working on critical internal systems. In the days before the layoffs, he focused on ensuring everything would run smoothly. He had received consistently strong performance ratings and said his managers agreed he was on track, but his termination letter assigned him a "Meets Most Expectations" rating. He said his managers didn't look at the self-review he submitted. "That told me everything. This wasn't about performance," he said. "This was about filling quotas." The manager expressed support for the decision, but said there were constraints around time and communication. In his view, the company culture had grown increasingly cutthroat, with employees clinging to projects to boost their ratings, jockeying within the performance curve, and seeing dissent increasingly punished. "Many people stay because the compensation is hard to walk away from, not because they believe in the mission. I was one of them. It was a place that offered scale and learning, but at a steep emotional cost," he said, adding that his healthy salary would have made him "an easy target" for cost-cutters. An engineer was laid off after five months of leave for a serious health crisis while in the middle of disability-related negotiations. He said his final performance rating — "Meets Most Expectations" — felt like "a scarlet letter." "I wasn't underperforming," he said. Peer reviews before the leave had been entirely positive, and he saved "screenshots of it all for my lawyer." His compensation exceeded $500,000, making him the highest-paid person on the team after his manager. He said he worked 60 to 75 hours before falling ill, but he sensed resentment after raising burnout concerns and stepping away from a major project. "And after the layoff? Nothing. My manager didn't even say goodbye." He said Meta's branding of laid-off workers as low performers "sets a dangerous precedent — companies can quietly rewrite the story of your career, and you don't get to fight back." He's exploring legal options. "Meta is telling one story," he said. "And for many of us, it's not the truth." Have a tip?

Title: UK's Deliveroo to be bought by US firm DoorDash for £2.9bn

Deliveroo, the food delivery app, has agreed to be taken over by US giant DoorDash in a deal valuing the business at £2.9bn. The combined company will have a presence in more than 40 countries serving about 50 million customers per month. The tie-up is also expected to provide fierce competition to rivals Just Eat and Uber Eats in the UK. However, the deal is the latest example of a UK-listed company being taken over by a US firm, fuelling further concerns over UK investment. DoorDash is offering 180p per Deliveroo share, which marks a 44% increase on the UK company's share price from the point when takeover talks were made public last month. However, it is well below the 390p share price that Deliveroo first floated at when it launched on the London Stock Exchange in April 2021. "The combination with Deliveroo will strengthen DoorDash's position as a leading global platform in local commerce," the two firms said. Will Shu, chief executive and co-founder of Deliveroo, said he was "very proud of everything we have achieved as a standalone business". However, he said the deal with DoorDash, which is based in San Francisco, was "transformative". "The enlarged group will have the scale to invest in product, technology and the overall consumer value proposition." The takeover is to be put forward to shareholders for final approval. Mr Shu, is set to receive about £172.4m for his 6.4% stake. Deliveroo, which was co-founded by Mr Shu in 2013, operates in nine countries with more 130,000 delivery riders. It provides a food delivery service by linking restaurants with customers through an app. It also supplies groceries. It made sales of about £2bn in 2024, while DoorDash, which was set up in the same year, made some £8bn last year through its operations in more than 30 countries. The companies both started out as food delivery services, offering customers convenient and quick access to a range of restaurants and takeaways, but DoorDash has grown into a much bigger business. DoorDash has seen its value soar after listing in the US, compared to Deliveroo, which has been listed in the UK. The takeover raises further questions for the London Stock Exchange, which has lost another big name to a US company. As well as takeovers, UK-listed firms worth hundreds of billions of pounds have been quitting the London Stock Exchange for the US over the past few years, prompting concerns over how attractive the UK is for investment. These include Cambridge-based microchip giant Arm Holdings, which now sells its shares in New York, Paddy Power's owner Flutter and equipment hire giant Ashtead. One of Deliveroo's first backers, Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, previously told the BBC that if he had his time again he would have voted for a US listing. News of a potential agreement between the firms emerged just over a week ago, and sent Deliveroo's share price up sharply. Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said DoorDash was aiming to "squeeze out" rivals such as Just Eat and "rattle Uber" in the UK. "The deal, expected to close later this year, could turn the UK market into a fierce two-horse race with DoorDash and Uber at the top," he added. "With no competing bid in sight, this looks like a bold, calculated move to outpace global rivals and gain ground fast." The takeover by a US firm shows the differing fortunes and attractions of US and UK stock markets. Oury Amadou Diallo, 22, did not have licence for modified bike classed as motorcycle, court hears. David Nicholson rents a school kitchen out of hours and cooks meals that are sold on Deliveroo app. Councillors say action is needed from companies to avoid the safety risks being posed to shoppers. Illegally converted bikes are linked to fires while charging, often overnight in users' homes. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Title: Deliveroo deal shows UK still can't hang on to big firms

Time Published: 2025-05-06T08:00:05Z
Full Content:
The takeover of Deliveroo by its US counterpart DoorDash is an illuminating example of the differing fortunes and attractions of US and UK stock markets. DoorDash's offer for Deliveroo values the business at £2.9bn and will create a company with operations in more than 40 countries. While both are similar companies, their fortunes have dramatically diverged over the past few years. Both started out as food delivery services offering customers convenient and speedy access to their favourite restaurants and offering restaurants the ability to more fully utilise the capacity of their kitchens. Both extended their offerings to include other convenience shopping items – like nappies, flowers and pet food. Both raised money by selling shares to the public in an initial public offering (IPO) around the same time – Deliveroo on the London stock market, DoorDash on the New York Stock Exchange. But when Deliveroo listed its shares in London, DoorDash was worth five times as much as its UK counterpart. Four years later DoorDash was worth 35 times as much. This is not a perfect comparison as DoorDash has issued more shares to raise money to expand over time which would boost its total value – its market capitalisation. But the appetite for shares in the US company meant that it could successfully raise that money on US markets. Let's look at another measure – the price of each share. An investor who bought a share of DoorDash has seen its value rise 84%. An investor who bought a share of Deliveroo has seen its value fall 56%. What this means is that DoorDash is now in a position to use its greater financial heft to take over its UK rival – just as Deliveroo is finally turning a profit. One of Deliveroo's first backers, Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, told the BBC in 2023 that if he had his time again he would have voted for a US listing, and people close to the company agree that the current takeover bid was partly enabled by DoorDash's access to US capital markets. This is just one example which helps explain a wider problem. Companies are increasingly shunning the London stock market in favour of a US listing. There are many reasons. Higher valuation. The 500 largest publicly traded US companies (S&P 500) are worth, on average, 28 times the profit they make in a year. The 100 largest publicly traded UK companies (the FTSE 100) sell for 12 times their yearly earnings. Less than half. How can there be such a huge disparity? Partly because the US is home to most of the world's most successful and profitable companies – the so-called Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) Take those out and shares trade at 20 times earnings – still a massive premium to the UK. One of the other reasons UK valuations lag is old-fashioned lack of demand. UK investors' appetite for UK stocks has shrivelled. Over the last 30 years, the share of the UK market owned by UK financial institutions has shrunk from 50% to less than 5%. This is partly because financial regulation has encouraged pension funds to buy less risky investments like government bonds. But it's also partly because the managers of those pension funds think they will get better returns investing in US markets – and they have been dead right. In just the last five years, the total return including dividends on investing in US shares has been 116% while the same number for the UK is 45%. But there are changes afoot. The government's so-called "Edinburgh Reforms", designed to make listing in the UK more attractive, included reducing the proportion of a company available for sale to the public and retaining more voting power for founders who wanted to keep control of the company even as they sold stakes to others. There have also been positive comments on the attractiveness of the UK from financial giants like Larry Fink of BlackRock and Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan. They both noted the UK looks undervalued and the UK market has outperformed the US so far this year. The secret that UK stocks are cheap has been out there for some time. That is precisely why private buyers from the US and elsewhere have swooped on UK-listed companies meaning they disappear from the UK stock market. Even some of the biggest ones left are considered candidates for a move. Shell boss Wael Sawan told the BBC that while he had "no immediate" plans to move, he and his company "got a very warm welcome" when they held their big reception for investors in New York. Shell trades at a 35% discount to its US-listed peers and many of its shareholders aren't happy about it. What the DoorDash swoop on Deliveroo seems to highlight once again is that companies listed in the US can summon greater financial firepower with which to expand or acquire their rivals. Deliveroo will join the likes of Arm Holdings, Morrisons, CRH Holdings, Ultra, Meggitt and many others as companies who used to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. Does it matter? Pension funds, or individual investors, can buy shares whether they are listed in the UK, US or one of the European exchanges. But a UK listing generates significant ancillary business for a UK financial services industry that still makes up more than 10% of the UK's entire economy and contributes more than 10% of all taxes paid here. Accountants, lawyers, financial PR firms and others feed off the fees that UK listings generate. Trading on the London Stock Exchange is dwarfed by the trading of currencies, bonds and complex contracts but it has always been a centre of gravity for financial activity and one which many argue has lost its power to attract. The deal is the latest example of a UK-listed company being taken over by a US rival. Oury Amadou Diallo, 22, did not have licence for modified bike classed as motorcycle, court hears.

Title: DoorDash agrees to buy Deliveroo in $3.9bn deal

DoorDash has agreed to buy UK-based food-delivery platform Deliveroo for an equity value of about £2.9 billion (€3.4 billion), as the US company pushes into more overseas markets. DoorDash has offered £1.80 in cash for each Deliveroo share, the company said in a statement on Tuesday, confirming the terms of an offer announced on April 25th. That’s a 29 per cent premium to Deliveroo’s closing share price on April 24. The deal is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. DoorDash, which controls two-thirds of the restaurant delivery market in the US, will expand its reach to more than 40 countries with the acquisition, it said. The two companies combined had a gross order value of about $90 billion last year and have a combined 50 million monthly active users. Deliveroo shares closed at £172.10 on Friday in trading in London, where markets were closed on Monday. The stock is up 21 per cent this year. DoorDash’s shares also advanced, closing at $205.40 on Monday, taking gains for the year to 22 per cent. DoorDash said that its offer is final and won’t be increased unless another bidder comes in for the UK company. Previous negotiations had ended in disagreement over Deliveroo’s valuation, Reuters reported last year. DoorDash, which provides a restaurant delivery service through a mobile application, said it would not increase its offer, but reserved a right to do so if a third party emerged with a competing offer for Deliveroo. The acquisition will help Doordash grow its market share in Europe, competing against Just Eat and Uber Eats. Britain and Ireland are Deliveroo’s largest market, accounting for 62% of the value of its orders in its latest quarter. Deliveroo’s directors, including chief executive officer Will Shu, have agreed to offer their shares in the deal, and DoorDash said it has agreements from investors representing 15.4 per cent of the stock so far. The deal needs the approval of owners representing 75 per cent of Deliveroo’s shares. The proposal is the latest example of consolidation in the industry, after Prosus in February agreed to buy Amsterdam’s Just Eat Takeaway. Food delivery companies are being pushed to combine after rapid acceleration during the Covid-19 pandemic lost steam in the years following. A new generation of global players with deep pockets are now competing for customers across borders. Deliveroo shares dropped in March after projecting earnings that fell far below analysts’ estimates, and the company exited the Hong Kong market, following disappointing sales and mounting competition. - Reporting: Bloomberg/Reuters Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

ADWEEK also learned of the decision to sunset the 20-year-old name from a source with knowledge of the matter. A WPP spokesperson told ADWEEK: “We don’t comment on speculation.” Switching out the 20-year-old name is set to occur before summer, and follows what WPP chief executive (CEO) Mark Read described in the company’s annual report as a “year of transition” for the media investment division under new CEO Brian Lesser, who joined in September 2024. GroupM employs around 40,000 people, more than a third of WPP’s total global workforce. Ad Age reported that there will be layoffs as part of the process, related to the consolidation of individual media agency teams. WPP declined to comment on any reduction in staff. Just now, GroupM operates with a core group of four global agencies: Mindshare, Wavemaker, EssenceMediacom, and T&Pm. It also offers cross-channel performance via GroupM Nexus, data solutions through Choreograph, and entertainment services via GroupM Motion Entertainment. Per WPP’s website, GroupM manages $63 billion worth of media budgets. Major clients include Amazon and Unilever. Coca-Cola is also a key account, however WPP recently lost the soda giant’s North American media business to rival Publicis Groupe. Lesser revamped GroupM’s leadership restructure in January 2025, axing global CEO positions for individual agencies and naming McKinsey & Company’s Emily Del Greco global chief operating officer (COO). Read recently told ADWEEK that GroupM was a key player in WPP’s turnaround plan as it posted a 5% Q1 2025 revenue dip amid ongoing financial struggles. Year-on-year revenue declined at GroupM for the quarter too, with growth in the U.S. offset by client losses from “previous years” and weakness in China. “At its best, GroupM is extremely competitive. We just need to make sure they’re on their best every day of the week,” Read said at the end of April. Mark Read is Still Banking on a GroupM Turnaround The CEO’s six-year tenure at WPP has been marked by consolidation to cut operating costs. One big change on the creative side involved bringing together VML and Y&R with Wunderman Thomson under the VML brand. On the media side, Read merged digital media agency Essence and media buying firm Mediacom to form EssenceMediacom. He also merged five of WPP’s branding and design agencies into Superunion, which was then combined with Design Bridge to create Design Bridge and Partners. Rebecca is Adweek's Europe brand editor.

Title: Cisco, UPS, other companies adjusting workforce as they embrace AI: report

Waystar CEO Matt Hawkins discusses denied healthcare claims and overturned rates on 'The Claman Countdown.' Some companies have been adjusting their workforce as they simultaneously embrace artificial intelligence and automation more, according to Forbes. The outlet reported over the weekend that Duolingo, UPS, Klarna, Cisco and Inuit are among some of the firms that have demonstrated that trend. Duolingo recently said it was striving to be "AI-first," with CEO Luis von Ahn outlining various measures that it will take to help accomplish that in a publicly available company-wide message, per Forbes. (Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Von Ahn said in the message that Duolingo will "gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle" and that headcount "will only be given if a team cannot automate more of their work." When hiring and doing performance reviews, people’s abilities to use AI will also be part of what the company considers, according to the message. DUOLINGO ANNOUNCES 148 COURSES CREATED WITH GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE LAUNCHING SOON ON PLATFORM The CEO said the "AI-first" moves focused on "removing bottlenecks so we can do more with the outstanding Duos we have" rather than "replacing Duos with AI." At UPS, some 20,000 employees are getting the ax, the company announced in late April. Forbes reported that UPS said AI wasn’t directly taking the place of employees, but the company is working to increase its efficiency through more automation and AI tools, something that the outlet said helped with shrinking its labor demands. UPS and Amazon, its largest customer, agreed in January that the e-commerce giant would reduce its package volume with UPS by more than 50%. Klarna has been leaning into AI more in recent years, using it for customer service, transaction processing and other functions, according to Forbes. (Jonas Walzberg/picture alliance via Getty Images) CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski has said in the past that certain human work functions can be done by AI, the outlet reported. In February last year, the company said that an AI chatbot it launched was capable of doing the work of 700 full-time agents. AI has enabled Klarna to have a smaller workforce, according to Forbes. Last fall, Cisco Systems embarked on a restructuring so it could invest in AI, cybersecurity and other growth areas, the outlet reported. When announcing the restructuring, the company also said in an SEC filing the move would "drive more efficiencies in its business." AI ENERGY DEMAND IN US WILL SURGE BUT ALSO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY TO MANAGE ENERGY Roughly 7% of the company’s workers lost their jobs as part of the restructuring. Cisco has been putting artificial intelligence into network management and customer support systems, Forbes reported. Meanwhile, Intuit announced layoffs of 1,800 workers in July last year as part of a reorganization to boost its investments in artificial intelligence, according to the outlet. CEO Sasan Goodarzi said the reorganization would "enable us to allocate additional investments to our most critical areas to support our customers and drive growth," per a company-wide email that the company included in an SEC filing at the time. The company identified AI-powered tools it offers as some of the initiatives that it wanted to put more money into, Forbes reported. (REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File) At the same time, Goodarzi said Intuit would hire 1,800 new people "primarily in engineering, product, and customer-facing roles" to support its growth areas. A MAJORITY OF SMALL BUSINESSES ARE USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AI started seeing a major increase in uptake in the wake of OpenAI releasing its ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022, spurring major investments and innovations in the sector.

Title: Trump shrugs off warnings over trade war costs

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Trump's tariffs are spiraling the U.S. toward an economic crisis as shipments slow down — and China doesn't plan to back down China vowed this week it would "never kneel down" to America in President Donald Trump's tariff war, as shipments of goods from China to the U.S. plummeted and economists and retailers warned of impending price hikes and empty store shelves. With most Chinese imports facing a 145 percent levy, "essentially all shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers have ceased," said Port of Los Angeles executive director Eugene Seroka. The chief economist of asset management giant Apollo, Torsten Slok, said he expects "empty shelves in U.S. stores in a few weeks" and "Covid-like shortages for consumers." That slowdown, Slok said, would result in "significant" layoffs in retail, trucking, and other sectors. Trump signaled his readiness to negotiate "substantial" tariff cuts and claimed Chinese President Xi Jinping had called him. But officials in Beijing denied negotiations were taking place and struck a defiant tone. "Bowing to a bully is like drinking poison to quench thirst," China's Foreign Ministry declared in a social media video. A report that Amazon would display the cost of Trump's tariffs alongside the price of products prompted fierce blowback from the White House; Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt called it a "hostile and political act." The company quickly disavowed any such plan, saying it was under consideration only for its low-cost Haul store and "was never approved." Trump said he'd called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and "solved the problem very quickly," praising him as a "good guy" who "did the right thing." Trump signed an executive order easing a 25 percent tariff on imported parts used by U.S. automakers. Foreign-made autos will remain subject to a 25 percent tax. Trump called it a "short term" allowance for automakers, who say the import duties will spike prices, cut sales, and lead to layoffs. But at a rally in Michigan, Trump vowed to stay the course on tariffs, and ultimately "slaughter" carmakers who don't shift production to the U.S. In an ABC News interview, he rejected the idea that American consumers would see any price rises. "China probably will eat those tariffs," he said. "Everything's going to be just fine." Escape your echo chamber. Get the facts behind the news, plus analysis from multiple perspectives.

"Economic mayhem is setting in" thanks to Trump's "crackpot tariff ideas," said the Houston Chronicle. The stock market has recorded its worst first 100 days of any presidential term since Gerald Ford took office in 1974, with the S&P 500 down 7.9 percent. Corporations are starting to furlough workers and pause expansion plans. And because tariff costs are ultimately passed along to consumers—not foreign firms as Trump likes to claim—a typical American family can expect its expenses to climb by $2,700 a year. "It won't be the president's billionaire buddies bearing the costs for them." Amazon should have stuck with its "brilliant tariff idea," saidThe Wall Street Journal. Tariffs are taxes, and online shoppers already get to see how they much they have to cough up in state taxes when they check out. Americans would benefit greatly from clarity about exactly what Trump's tariffs will cost them, but "instead of owning its policy," the White House "bullied Amazon to keep quiet." What is Trump afraid of? Small businesses across the U.S. are reeling, said Daisuke Wakabayashi in The New York Times. Hundreds of owners tell the Times they've "been stunned into paralysis" by the tariffs and the uncertainty of what's coming next. Tim Fulton, who runs a business in Alaska making conveyor belts for airline cargo, had to raise prices due to new tariffs on essential components that are only made overseas, like motorized rollers from Japan. A pipeline of interested customers then "disappeared overnight," and potential investors retreated. Instead of growing his business, Fulton is now consulting a bankruptcy lawyer. Consumers haven't yet felt the sting, but they will soon, said Dominic Pino in The Washington Post. There's a lag, because ships from China take a month to cross the Pacific Ocean and because retailers loaded up on inventory before the tariffs hit. But "boatloads of pain" will land when retailers run out of product and choose to restock at much higher prices—or decide to let shelves sit empty. Trump's tariffs "might steal Christmas," said The Economist. Some 80 percent of the toys sold here come from China. Production "has ground to a halt," and unless import duties are slashed, nearly half the small-and medium-size firms surveyed by The Toy Association say they'll be out of business within months. Trump is taking a phenomenal risk, said Adam Cancryn in Politico. He was elected on promises of lower prices and an economic "golden age." Instead, his "chaotic" tariffs are "shaking the foundations" of America's financial system and have put his approval rating underwater by double digits. True to form, Trump is blaming stock market woes on former President Joe Biden, said Mark Antonio Wright in National Review, claiming this week it's suffering a Biden "overhang." But "every American" knows Trump owns these tariffs—and any economic fallout. A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com "We are on the verge of an economic crisis that could leave America poorer for generations," said James Briggs in The Indianapolis Star. It doesn't feel that way now. But recall early 2020, when we knew a lethal novel virus was coming for us and blithely went about our lives. Life felt normal, "until it didn't." Right now, "the vast majority of economic indicators are screaming crisis," the dollar is down, and CEOs say we're heading for a recession. With Trump's next moves uncertain, "the future is unwritten, but the risks are coming into focus." Trump's levies are being challenged by a raft of lawsuits, said Erik Larson in Bloomberg. Attorneys general from 12 states and legal advocacy groups representing numerous businesses have sued, arguing that Trump's claiming of emergency powers to impose the tariffs is unconstitutional. This week, the administration asked the U.S. trade court to reject one such suit, saying the plaintiffs are improperly "inviting judicial second-guessing of the president's judgment." Meanwhile, China shows no sign it's ready to back down, said Ryan Hass in Time. With no competitive elections, its leaders believe China's political system is "more unified, hardened, and disciplined than the Trump administration to withstand a trade war." And the Chinese have "tools at hand to hit America's economy where it hurts, including the withholding of critical minerals and key inputs to America's industrial value chains." In short, "Beijing believes time is on its side," so if there's going to be a retreat in the trade war, "it will need to come from Trump."

Title: Rite Aid files for bankruptcy — again | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Rite Aid on Monday announced it is filing for bankruptcy for a second time, barely just seven months after the chain exited Chapter 11 and emerged as a private company. The financially strapped drug store chain said it is looking for a buyer, and re-filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection will help facilitate that process. The company said it would keep its stores open throughout its bankruptcy. “While we have continued to face financial challenges, intensified by the rapidly evolving retail and healthcare landscapes in which we operate, we are encouraged by meaningful interest from a number of potential national and regional strategic acquirors,” said Matt Schroeder, Rite Aid’s CEO, in a statement. “As we move forward, our key priorities are ensuring uninterrupted pharmacy services for our customers and preserving jobs for as many associates as possible.” Rite Aid first filed for bankruptcy in October 2023, becoming a casualty of a miserable environment for drug stores, exacerbated by its runner-up status to bigger chains and expensive legal battles for allegedly filling unlawful opioid prescriptions that pushed its debt to nearly $4 billion. It took about a year to navigate the Chapter 11 process, finally emerging in September 2024 by slashing $2 billion in debt, securing $2.5 billion in funds to keep operating and the closure of about 500 locations. On Monday, Rite Aid said it secured nearly $2 billion in new financing to keep it operational during its bankruptcy. Rite Aid is a distant third-largest nationwide standalone pharmacy chain in the United States — and the seventh largest pharmacy overall, when taking into account big box chains. It has about 1,250 stores remaining — roughly half of the number it had just two years ago. It was offered a $17 billion lifeline in 2015 when Walgreens offered to buy the chain. But the deal was met with stiff scrutiny from US regulators who feared the combination would violate federal antitrust laws and reduce competition in the drug store market. Ultimately, in 2017, the companies agreed to a smaller, $4.4 billion deal, in which Walgreens bought just under 2,000 Rite Aid locations, leaving Rite Aid diminished in stature and unable to compete at the scale of its bigger rivals. Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData, a data analytics company, said he was not surprised by Rite Aid’s second bankruptcy, since the drug store chain hasn’t been able to secure enough inventory to keep shelves stocked. “The first bankruptcy did little to resolve the chain’s issues, and it has been teetering on the edge of survival for quite some time,” Saunders said. With Walgreens no longer in a position to buy Rite Aid outright, the most likely outcome is that other drug store and retail chains will “cherry pick” individual Rite Aid stores to purchase and keep open, Saunders said. Rite Aid’s bankruptcy comes amid struggles for its rivals, too. Walgreens Boots Alliance announced in March that it’s being taken private in a deal valued up to $24 billion, following a largely disastrous run on the public markets where its market cap has lost billions and more than 1,200 of its locations have closed or plan to close. The transaction is expected to be finalized later this year. Related article Why Walgreens, CVS and Rite Aid are closing thousands of drug stores across America At CVS, the chain has closed more than 1,000 stores and undergone thousands of layoffs over the past several months. The company is experimenting with a new, smaller-format store that only focuses on the pharmacy rather than the retail part. All three chains have struggled with declining prescription reimbursements in recent years, sending its value plummeting to just around $9.5 billion from $100 billion a decade ago. They have also all become ubiquitous and over-expanded, with the chains becoming synonymous with convenience stores, giving people the option to pick-up their medication and perhaps grab something else, too. However, they’ve struggled to keep up with Amazon, Target and other retailers and have also had issues with theft, which has chipped away their profitability. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Time Published: 2025-05-05T20:26:06Z
Full Content:
The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Are you ready for store shelves to start emptying all over America? When I first started writing about the coming shortages last month, I received quite a bit of criticism. But now expert after expert is warning that we really are facing a crisis of historic proportions. Most major retailers still have several weeks of inventory on hand, but after that shortages are going to start becoming very visible. For smaller businesses, the shortages will be noticeable a lot sooner. On Sunday, I visited a local small business to purchase some groceries. In addition to selling groceries, this particular discount store also sells a wide variety of other products, and some of them are made in China. As I walked through the aisles, I was stunned by how low their stock levels were. Honestly, it was kind of depressing. Of course anything that we are witnessing now is just the leading edge of what is eventually coming. According to CNN, it is being estimated that “Chinese imports into the United States will plunge by as much as 80% by the second half of the year”… The historically high tariff on China has effectively stopped all trade between the two countries, Trump has said repeatedly. The number of cargo ships headed from China to the United States fell 60% in April, according to Flexport, a logistics and freight forwarding broker. JPMorgan estimates Chinese imports into the United States will plunge by as much as 80% by the second half of the year. American consumers should expect pandemic-like disruptions as goods that were warehoused before tariffs took effect begin to run out over the next week or so, including higher prices, shortages and empty store shelves. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said repeatedly that the high tariff on China are “unsustainable,” and Trump also said he expects the tariff to come down. But it would need to come down significantly – by more than half – for any real trade to recommence, trade experts say. But even then, the economic damage would be done — and it would be weeks or even months before American shelves would be replenished. This is going to be catastrophic. Anyone that cannot see this simply does not understand how our system works. Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen is a supply chain expert that helps thousands of businesses move products around the globe, and he is warning that we are facing “an extinction-level, asteroid-wiping-out-the-dinosaurs kind of event”… “If they don’t change the tariffs, it’s going to be an extinction-level, asteroid-wiping-out-the-dinosaurs kind of event,” he told me. “Only these aren’t dinosaurs. These are dynamic, healthy businesses.” He knows this because those businesses are his customers. They use Flexport to transport products from the factory to your front door. Petersen’s company handles everything from booking space on planes, trucks and enormous ocean carriers to managing all the tedious paperwork along the way. Ryan Petersen knows exactly what he is talking about, because dealing with supply chains is what he does for a living. According to Petersen, container bookings from China to the United States have already fallen by 60 percent… But since the tariffs took effect, ocean-freight bookings from China to the U.S. have dropped 60%, Petersen says. In response, containership operators are shrinking their boats and canceling trips altogether. It takes a while for downstream consequences to flow through the system—but logistics nerds can look at the data on their screens and see into the future. If tariffs continue at this rate, Petersen says, it’s only a matter of time before that asteroid hits. There are thousands upon thousands of products that are made in China that aren’t made anywhere else. And it takes years to build new factories and set up new supply chains. So how are we possibly going to replace the 438 billion dollars of imports from China that normally fill up our store shelves? Of course the truth is that we aren’t going to replace those imports and store shelves will soon start getting emptier and emptier. In addition, it is likely that we will see massive layoffs as supply chains all over the U.S. slow down dramatically. Southern California is one area that will get hit particularly hard… With more than 70% of the port workforce living within a 10-mile radius of the complex, LA’s waterfront communities of San Pedro, Wilmington and Long Beach are expected to be the first hit by the slowdown, but they will certainly not be the last, said Gary Herrera, president of International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) local 13. “One in every five jobs in southern California is tied to the ports – warehouse workers, truck drivers, logistic teams and more,” said Herrera, who has been a longshore worker since 1998. Herrera says LA’s Inland Empire, including Riverside and San Bernardino, which serve as warehousing centers for retailers such as Walmart and Amazon, as well as communities such as Bakersfield and Barstow, which have freight rail lines, will also be severely affected. Even if President Trump made a deal with China this week, we are being told that it could take up to a year for our supply chains to fully return to normal… “These are big, massive bullwhips that have not been seen since COVID,” Evan Smith, the CEO of the supply-chain-management company Altana Technologies, told me. “The tariffs themselves are a shock to the system, and the shock is echoed and amplified across the entire chain. Even if there is resolution, it will take nine to 12 months to work out these bumps.” The good news is that it appears that the Chinese are open to beginning negotiations with the Trump administration. But the Chinese are insisting that they will not be coerced into making a deal. There had been hope that tariffs on Chinese goods would be reduced in an attempt to get China to the negotiating table, but President Trump has slammed the door on that possibility… When Welker directly asked, “You’re not dropping the tariffs against China to get them to the negotiating table?” Trump’s response was unequivocal: “No.” His firm stance underscores a broader strategy of using tariffs as leverage to protect American economic interests and curb China’s global influence. Even if negotiations commenced tomorrow, we would probably not see a deal with China until months from now. Meanwhile, our supply chain crisis will continue to get worse with each passing day. If there is anything that is made in China that you are going to need, I would get it immediately. It does not appear that President Trump plans to reverse course on his tariffs any time soon. In fact, he just unveiled a new 25 percent tariff rate on most foreign-made auto parts… President Trump’s tariffs on foreign-made auto parts began on May 3, with automakers receiving some concessions from the administration but still feeling the heat on others. Trump signed an executive order formalizing the new rules late last week, which gave some carve-outs to what would have been blanket 25% tariffs on imported auto parts.

CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of AppLovin investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 10, 2023 and March 26, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/applovin-corporation-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=146628&wire=3 APP investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures.

Title: Netflix stock was supposed to be safe from the trade war. Then Trump talked movie tariffs

Netflix (NFLX) was supposed to get its happily ever after: Its stock had been skyrocketing, and Wall Street largely saw it as a recession-proof play amid swirling macroeconomic concerns. But that all changed with one social media post from President Donald Trump, in which he announced plans to impose a 100% tariff on all movies made outside the U.S. The president wrote Sunday night on his Truth Media social platform that the “Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death.” Trump claimed that other countries are offering incentives to studios outside the country, which is “a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!” He finished the post: “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick responded on X, saying, “We’re on it.” As of now, there are no details on how this plan will be implemented or what will be included in these tariffs. Netflix’s stock price fell almost 3.7% between Friday’s close and Monday’s open. It’s since risen some throughout the day, but it’s still down about 1.3% as of midday. This sudden fall marks a stark reversal from late April, when a bullish analyst report from William Blair said Netflix is “currently not experiencing economic headwinds with stable retention” after its strong quarter. The financial services firm maintained its “outperform” rating for Netflix’s stock. “Netflix is relatively more insulated from the recent market turmoil because it is not overly exposed to tariffs and will be relatively resilient in any potential future economic downturn,” analysts Ralph Schackart and Jack Brenczewski wrote in the report. “Overall, Netflix remains well positioned to remain a secular streaming winner, in our view, and we believe longer term it will continue to have pricing power.” Other entertainment companies have seen somewhat similar dips following Trump’s social media post. Paramount’s (PARA) stock is down 0.7%, Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) is down 0.6%, and Lions Gate (LGF.A) is a big loser on the day, down 5.4% as of early Monday afternoon. Disney’s (DIS) stock fell but has since recovered its earlier losses, up 0.1%, similar to Comcast (CMCSA), which was up 0.4%. Key details of the president’s plan remain unclear, including whether the tariff would apply only to theatrical releases or also to streaming content, how it would be calculated — by production budget or box office revenue — and whether it would affect TV shows or already-completed films. Citigroup (C) analyst Jason Bazinet told The Wrap that, in a worst-case scenario, Netflix could face a 20% decline in earnings and an annual cost increase of $3 billion. He said, however, that the actual impact is likely to be significantly lower. According to Citigroup’s analysis, the streaming platform currently spends about $17 billion per year on content, with 60% of that being original productions and the remaining 40% licensed. Of the original content, half is produced outside the U.S. Based on these figures, a 100% tariff on movies could reduce earnings per share by 20%, or approximately six cents. And that cost could be passed on to Netflix’s consumers. “If we assume U.S. production costs are 35% higher than non-U.S. costs, it’s akin to a $1 billion increase in annual costs,” Bazinet said. “If this cost is borne by U.S. consumers, it would cause [average revenue per user in the U.S. and Canada] to rise about 7%.” Trump addressed his planned movie tariffs in front of reporters later Sunday after returning from Mar-a-Lago. He said, “I’ve done some very strong research over the past week, and we’re making very few movies now. Hollywood is being destroyed. Now, you have a grossly incompetent governor that allowed that to happen, so I’m not just blaming other nations, but other nations have stolen our movie industry.” Hollywood producers and labor unions have been urging Governor Gavin Newsom to boost the state’s tax incentives to better compete with other locations. A ProdPro survey of executives found California was the sixth most-preferred place to film in the next couple of years, behind Toronto, the U.K, Vancouver, Central Europe, and Australia. When speaking to reporters, Trump also accused other countries of stealing America’s “moviemaking capabilities” and said their financial support for Hollywood films was “sort of a threat to our country in a sense.” In January, Trump named Jon Voight, Sylvester Stallone, and Mel Gibson as “special ambassadors” to bring a “troubled” Hollywood back “bigger, better and stronger than ever before.” Sources told Variety that Voight and his manager, Steven Paul, have been taking meetings with various guilds to advise the president on how to reinvigorate filming in the U.S. Under Trump’s proposal, nearly all of this year’s major blockbusters would have been affected, including the top-grossing Minecraft Movie, filmed in New Zealand, and Captain America: Brave New World, which was shot across multiple countries, including the U.S. Coming releases such as Mission: Impossible: The Final Reckoning and the John Wick spin-off Ballerina would also feel the weight of the president’s tariffs. Gibson, meanwhile, has been planning to shoot his Passion of the Christ sequel in Italy. “I think the most likely consequence is not that more productions will be done outside of America, or more productions would be done in America, but probably that just fewer productions will (be made),” Scott Roxborough, the Europe bureau chief of the Hollywood Reporter, told Reuters. On Monday, the British media and entertainment union Bectu called on the British government to “move swiftly to defend this vital sector ... as a matter of essential national economic interest.” Officials in Australia and New Zealand also responded to Trump’s proposed movie tariffs by pledging support for their local sectors, which have become key global filming hubs — Marvel movies have been filmed in Australia, while New Zealand was home to The Lord of the Rings franchise. So will we see the third Dune movie filmed in New Mexico and the next Mission Impossible installment in South Dakota? For now, the only certainty is uncertainty — and a growing sense that Netflix’s “safe” status in a trade war may have been a Hollywood fantasy all along.

Title: Weighing The Positives Of Fully Remote Workplaces
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2025/05/05/weighing-the-positives-of-fully-remote-workplaces/
Time Published: 2025-05-05T16:02:29Z

ByMegan Poinski ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff. As technology continues to define business opportunities, there are basic needs that are integral to every development. Last week, I attended a panel at Honeywell’s Future of Energy Summit in Washington, D.C., at which top industry and policy leaders discussed two: energy and AI. Page Crahan, general manager of Tapestry at Google’s X, the Moonshot Factory, said that AI is becoming as ubiquitous among businesses as energy. “Would you ever ask a business owner if they use math?” Crahan asked. Gordon Bitko, IT Industry Council executive vice president of policy, said energy and AI are inextricably linked. “AI uses a lot of power, so the answer is: Let’s use more AI to figure out how to use less energy,” Bitko said. Industry has used AI technology for years to determine ways to be more efficient, so this sounds like a paradox. AI is being used to create hardware that can process data better, and it only makes sense to use AI to determine the best ways to generate power, optimize workloads and automate data centers. Crahan’s project is building an AI-powered, unified platform for the electric grid. Crahan said Tapestry is essentially creating “Google Maps for electrons” to figure out and predict what’s happening throughout the grid. And the rise of AI— which she called a wonderful tool for helping solve extremely complex problems with data—is coming at the perfect time. But while AI can find solutions, it comes back to the question of power. Bitko said that for AI to do its best, the U.S. needs to de-risk investment in the technologies that can improve performance and capacity for energy infrastructure, as well as get the critical materials available to build them. China has not been waiting to move forward, Bilko said, and the U.S. shouldn’t either. Crahan added that there’s another key to making quick advancements: People talking to one another and sharing their solutions. This isn’t just a matter of companies and countries talking, but also people from different parts of organizations communicating and understanding one another. “It’s really on us to take those actions forward, and that is what gives me a lot of optimism is this community is here for the change and we help each other,” Crahan said. “We want to drive change, and I think that’s really special.” Honeywell Global Regions CEO Anant Maheshwari moderated the discussion, in which Rep. Julie Fedorchak (R-N.D.) also participated. Many companies are asking their employees to return to the office this year, but there are still fully remote companies. I spoke with Ann Schlemmer, CEO of software company Percona, about why her employees will not be asked to report to an office anytime soon. An excerpt from our conversation appears later in this newsletter. Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange last Wednesday. Last week, the markets fully recovered from the “Liberation Day” tariff announcement crash, with the S&P 500 seeing its longest winning streak since 2004. Investors were encouraged by better job growth than expected—177,000 non-farm jobs added from March to April, beating expectations of 133,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics—and better-than-expected earnings reports from Big Tech, including Microsoft, Meta and Amazon. Inflation in March also moderated, according to Commerce Department data released last week, with the personal consumption expenditures index up 2.3% from last year, and core inflation—excluding food and energy costs—matching estimates of 2.6% in March. Even though these are positive metrics, they don’t necessarily indicate a recovering economy. While stocks have recovered from their low point in early April, markets are still down since Donald Trump’s presidency began in late January—the S&P is now 5% lower. According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump’s first 100 days in office have been the worst for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 since President Richard Nixon’s second term in 1973. While there was more job growth than expected, a report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that layoffs are way up—April’s cuts were up 63% compared to a year ago, and the more than 600,000 layoffs so far in 2025 are 87% higher than at this point in 2024. The firm found that 48% of the layoffs were tied to cuts made by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Forbes senior contributor Teresa Ghilarducci found troubling signs for employment underneath the strong job creation numbers. Worker confidence is down: 11.8% of the unemployed had left their jobs, down from 13.2% in January. Payroll numbers only increased by 0.3%, though inflation is much higher. Long-term unemployment is on the rise—1.9% of unemployed people have been without work for 15 weeks or longer, up from 1.4% in January. The economy as a whole also contracted significantly in the first quarter. According to the Bureau of Economic Research, GDP was down 0.3% compared with the last three months of 2024. That’s a drop from steady previous growth—GDP was up 2.4% in Q4—and the weakest growth since Q1 of 2022. Much of the drop in GDP came from fewer imports, as sweeping tariffs loom. And while the Trump administration has touted deals in progress—including talks to reduce a 145% tariff on China—nothing has been announced and Beijing says it is evaluating whether to negotiate. Tariffs are already reducing the amounts of goods shipped to the U.S. from China, setting the stage for fewer items on shelves in coming months, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Last week, the Trump Administration also eliminated the de minimis trade exemption, which allowed low-cost items from online retailers, including Temu and Shein, to be shipped to the U.S. duty-free. Now, items from those retailers are seeing a 145% tariff, more than doubling prices for U.S. consumers. Meanwhile, several companies anticipating a negative impact from tariffs for the rest of the year have reduced their estimates or pulled guidance. Warren Buffett in 2017. One of the world’s most respected CEOs unexpectedly announced over the weekend that he would step down at the end of the year. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett is handing the reins of the firm to Berkshire Hathaway Energy CEO Greg Abel, which he announced at the end of his address at the annual shareholders’ meeting. Forbes’ Hank Tucker writes the news surprised nearly everyone there—board members and Abel included—though the timing seems to make sense. Buffett is 94 and worth some $168 billion over the weekend, according to Forbes estimates. Buffett has been Berkshire Hathaway CEO since 1965, and the announcement of his step down received a standing ovation. Abel, a 62-year-old Canadian who’s been with Berkshire since it acquired MidAmerican Energy in 1999, will have big shoes to fill. Buffett, known as the “Oracle of Omaha,” is an American legend for his shrewdness in investing. Even this year prior to Buffett’s announcement, Berkshire’s stock is up 19%, nearly matching its compounded annual gain of 19.9% from 1965 to 2024. Just about every company wants to improve its adoption of and expertise in AI this year, and C-suite executives are also getting into it. According to a recent survey by LinkedIn, 88% of C-suite execs say speeding AI adoption is a top priority this year. Executives are looking for their employees to become AI experts, but they aren’t forgetting themselves. C-suite leaders are 1.2 times more likely to add AI literacy skills to their LinkedIn profile than other professionals, and three times as many C-suite leaders have AI skills on their profiles now compared to two years ago. This isn’t to say that C-suites across the board are getting the AI skills they need. About four in 10 leaders said their top team is preventing AI adoption, citing reasons like lack of training, no change management plan, and failure to be convinced of AI’s ROI. LinkedIn and Microsoft have opened several AI skills courses, making them free of charge for several months. The time spent gaining AI skills is likely to pay off. LinkedIn found that 51% of organizations that adopted generative AI reported revenue increases of at least 10%. Percona CEO Ann Schlemmer. Open source database software company Percona has always been a fully remote company since its founding in 2006, so it was already in the swing of a distributed workforce when most of the country’s offices shut down for the Covid-19 pandemic. Percona currently has just over 350 employees located in 52 countries around the globe, and CEO Ann Schlemmer says they have no intention of requiring them to work together in an office somewhere. (Percona does have a headquarters office in North Carolina, where the COO works.) I talked to Schlemmer about being an all-remote company in a world that is moving toward requiring employees to return to the office. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. Why does being remote work for Percona? Schlemmer: We put a lot of work behind it. This was our intention from the very beginning: don’t let geography determine your talent. It also was a little bit of a labor arbitrage, that you could get high quality talent and maybe in lower cost centers. Trying to get all tech talent from Silicon Valley is really expensive. We have always been bootstrapped and customer-funded—we haven’t taken outside funding. That was also part of the drive: finding those areas of technical expertise globally that other people may not have found. Are you receiving more interest from potential employees now that a lot of workplaces are putting out return to office mandates? Yes. Flexibility [is a common reason] for sure. In our company, we’ve always had this mentality of being able to flex and have that flexibility as long as you get the job done. That said, not every job has flexibility. [In] some of our customer-facing roles, it’s very clear that you're expected to be available for the customers between certain hours. As a CEO, what I really care about is someone getting their job done in the time that we expect them to get it done and that they have the tools and capabilities to do that. Expectations with your colleagues on your availability would happen whether you’re remote or in person. There has to be a really high degree of trust when you are a remote worker—which also means that you need to have a high level of your own personal accountability in getting the job done, being clear on expectations and can you fulfill those expectations in that environment. With you at the helm, would you ever consider making Percona a company where people have to go into an office? I don’t see that it would ever be a whole company initiative. I could see that if there was a business case: That we had a specific team that was trying to drive new product innovation and the request was, we have the center and we want to be in person to do that, or we found that that really is the most effective. I could see that as very use-case specific. The company itself now, I wouldn't see the advantage of that. And for us in our structure, it would be a massive cost that I don’t think would give me an ROI that would make it appealing. What advice would you give to business leaders who have been much more remote since Covid and are trying to decide whether they should go back to an office? If the question is singularly return to the office or stay remote, start with what problem you are trying to solve and have clarity on that. Really large corporations have a big commercial investment that they’ve made into real estate, so, versus selling that off, they want a return on that investment. They want people coming in. And their culture and systems have been built around being in-person. That is pretty compelling. It’s a matter of defining what problem are you trying to solve, being clear on that and gaming it out to understand what are the consequences, positives, and potentially negatives of those decisions—which is what business leaders do anyway. They always have to weigh the cost of their decisions.

May 05, 2025 09:10 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, May 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: These 5 Red Flags Could Make You First To Be Laid Off In 2025

ByRachel Wells ByRachel Wells, Contributor. You may be a liability if you have outdated skill sets. With 2025 breaking records for the most layoffs in February since the pandemic, and the highest number of tech job cuts in April, you’re probably scared that you’ll be the next one receiving a mass email or invited to a suspicious HR call. Increasing numbers of employers are adapting to the AI era, and that means implementing sweeping changes or “restructuring” across their workforce and workflows, and removing employees who don’t align with their agenda or who are costing the company too much money or lack of “efficiency,” as they often term it. Additionally, some like Intel, as reported by TechCrunch, have had lower quarterly earnings than expected, which has necessitated these employers looking across their divisions and seeing what employees are core to the business and which ones they can do without or dispense with. Frankly, when employers make these layoff decisions, there are three top criteria that they evaluate which ultimately influence the specific employees they decide to let go. In an update sent via email, General Assembly interviewed HR directors and managers in tech companies and found that the employees most likely to be let go include those who display these five red flags: It may not be what you want to hear, especially when it comes to remote work, but this is the reality. Thankfully, there are things you can do about it. If you can be replaced by AI, the odds are you will be. And if you’re not sure if your job is prone to being replaced by automation, just check out this list of 21 jobs that are bound to be obsolete by 2030 and are rapidly declining even now. So if you discover that you’re working in a job at high risk of being fully automated, then now is the time to seriously consider making a career pivot. Consider other career paths and job opportunities that leverage your transferable skills and any industry background you have which might be relevant. Think about what you have a passion in, and take time to research what jobs and new skill sets will be in high demand right now, as new job titles are created. Your skills become outdated when you’re not willing to adapt and embrace change. If you remain stuck in the same mindset since you first embarked on your job or career, you will never grow. A growth mindset acknowledges changes that are happening, and instead of ignoring them, seeks to adapt by upskilling, undertaking more professional development, seeking out new opportunities, and reflecting on one’s progress. To ensure your skills are always up to date and in high demand, check out the core skills and rising skills you need in today’s labor market based on recent data from the World Economic Forum, so you can strengthen those areas and include them in your resume. It’s a good idea to periodically check in with your manager to assess how well you’re performing against key indicators and employee standards, including company culture. Don’t just be passive and wait for your boss to inform you when it’s too late. While a good manager will inform you without needing to be asked, some won’t, so you need to be proactive and regularly gauge your performance. Come well-prepared for your one-to-one meetings with your manager. Take time to be self-aware and journal your progress in your job. Note down areas where you could do with some improvement or support, as well as areas where you find you’re exceptionally strong in, and bring these to your line manager. Ask them for support in your weak areas and see if they could recommend or signpost you to peer mentorship or other internal company resources to support your growth. Outside of your job, take time to strengthen your incompetency by undergoing extra training and courses, and attending events if necessary. Of course, there will always be times when a company catches you by surprise and lists your name along with other underperforming employees in a cop-out to cover their atrocious layoffs. You should ensure that you have accurate documentation of your progress and conversations with your manager about your performance so you can challenge this if necessary. If you work in a department that is severely defunded or not receiving due attention and allocation of resources, that’s a strong warning sign that your job is likely on the line. If not now, it will be later. Keep your eyes and ears open for signs of senior leadership dismissing specific departments or projects as not being key priorities. Review your company’s annual statement, its vision, and long-term strategies for the next three to five years. These provide strong indicators of where the company is headed, what areas leadership wants to focus on, and where new job opportunities may arise. If you sense that your role or department might be eliminated in any way, ask your manager to consider how you can progress to another department or role internally. Proactively seek to engage with cross-functional teams and projects, get your hands dirty in everything, and become well-known to several employees within the company at different levels and departments, especially those at the senior leadership level. Make yourself seen and make your presence felt across different projects. This aligns you for better opportunities within the company, so if it decides to cut a project or department, you have already jumped ship to the right place. We’ve already seen this year how thousands of federal employees have been laid off or been threatened with layoffs if they would not comply with the new in-office working stipulations imposed by the Trump administration. Amazon also began mandating all its employees to work from the office five days a week in January, and other companies have also followed. Therefore, if you work within a large company that traditionally embraces hybrid or in-person work, consider yourself a liability. Even if your role is remote right now, there may come a time where it won’t be that way forever, and you’ll be forced to either switch to working more days or hours in the office, or handing in your notice. The safest way to avoid this while continuing to hold on to your remote working status is to opt into freelancing or independent contractor work, particularly where knowledge-based work is concerned. As a freelance professional, you can work on your own terms, on your own schedule, and from whatever location you please, so long as you get the job done. While many employers view remote workers, deprioritized projects, underperformance, outdated skill sets, and automation as valid reasons to lay off their employees, you don’t need to be affected by these red flags. Now that you know what influences the decisions at the top, you can use the tips and resources to future-proof your career and maintain job stability.

Title: News Influencers Are Reaching Young People, and the Media Is Trying to Keep Up

It’s no surprise that young Americans say social media is their preferred way to get news. But a growing number of them are turning to news influencers — those familiar faces who often share frank, relatable, direct-to-camera videos — to learn about what’s going on. In 2024, a Pew Research study found that about one in five Americans (21%) — including 37% of adults under 30 — said they regularly got news from influencers. Divya Nagarajan, 19, a student at Emory University, says that seeing the same people in her feed makes them feel more trustworthy. “It's kind of like the parasocial thing where it feels like I know them,” she tells Teen Vogue. Nagarajan says she favors the conversational tone news influencers use and the personal feel of their content vs. the onslaught of breaking alerts from legacy outlets. Says Rachel Karten, a social media consultant and author of the Link in Bio newsletter, whether it's TikTok or Instagram, people don’t want to leave the platforms where they already scroll, so you have to meet them where they are: "They're not there necessarily to consume news, but if it comes across their feed, they're going to watch it," she explains. "And they're going to start to maybe grow a connection with the person who is reporting that news.” Relatability, perceived trustworthiness, ease of consumption: These are just some of the reasons young people say they’re turning to these influencer voices. Online-first news outlets like NowThis and AJ+ have long understood this; more traditional outlets, however, have only just started experimenting with what has been called “talent-driven journalism,” hiring news influencers who have a strong personal brand to lead their social presence. Influencers can be a great way to connect with new audiences, but there are concerns that social content creators could be fueling the misinformation crisis. According to Pew, 77% of these influencers have no journalism background or affiliation with a news organization, which means they may not have strict standards for vetting the information they share. The growing interest in hiring or promoting camera-ready creators with a strong personal brand is also troubling for journalists who aren’t particularly interested in being social media stars. Of course, talent-driven journalism isn’t exactly new. From familiar names in print to favorite radio hosts to iconic CBS broadcaster Walter Cronkite’s comforting and constant "And that's the way it is" sign-off, people have long preferred voices they recognize. That recognition breeds trust, and it's no different on social media. So some traditional media companies are now bringing influencers in-house, or focusing on growing the followings of in-house creators, to help reach younger audiences. Mayra Báez, an audience strategist and AI consultant, helped launch AJ+, Al Jazeera’s social media news and storytelling project, in 2014, intertwining the outlet’s online brand with journalists' personal brands. In addition to making the news more engaging and approachable, Báez tells Teen Vogue via email, the move put journalists in direct conversation with audiences where they were increasingly spending time: on their phones. “Social media-first newsrooms started doing this over a decade ago; the difference is that legacy media is only now catching up, and not by choice, but out of necessity.” The Washington Post’s social media audience skews younger than its audiences on other platforms, according to the publication’s “TikTok guy” Dave Jorgenson, and audience members feel a personal connection to the account's hosts after seeing them in videos for years. “These people have been with us since they were teenagers, and we take that relationship very seriously,” he says. “We know for a fact that our audience trusts us more because of our presence on TikTok and [YouTube] Shorts.” Jorgenson, who launched the Post’s TikTok channel in 2019, recently spun off a Post-produced series, Local News International, on his personal YouTube channel. The series is designed to be cut down for vertical video and shared on the Post’s other accounts to help grow those audiences. In January, the Post doubled down on its talent-driven strategy, restructuring its public relations division to focus on developing a “star talent unit” — a move that resulted in layoffs at the outlet, which is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Stay up-to-date with the politics team. Sign up for the Teen Vogue Take Sara Sines, a 24-year-old dancer and performer, says she gets most of her news from influencers on social media, though the content often appears in her feed without her seeking it out. If she recognizes the face of someone whose approach she liked in the past, even if she doesn’t know their name, she stops to hear their take when they pop up on her For You page. For some publishers, social media has been the key to reaching new, younger audience members, like Sines, who may be unfamiliar with an outlet's nonsocial reporting. Morning Brew, which first launched as a business newsletter in 2015, has grown a stand-alone social media audience of millions of followers in part by leaning into creators, says Macy Gilliam, a video producer at the media company. “Young people like to follow people; they don't really like to follow brands,” she notes. "We are people at the brand, so it's kind of like bridging the gap.” Since stepping into an on-camera role two years ago, Gilliam, 24, appears every week in several short videos on Morning Brew’s social channels and has become a recognizable presence. “They'll comment things like, ‘Oh, I love when Macy does this,’ ‘Oh, Macy's always joking about that.’” This familiarity, she says, gives Morning Brew’s audience a stronger affinity for both the creator and the brand. Gilliam, who recently launched a new video franchise under the Morning Brew umbrella, believes introducing creator personalities on an outlet’s existing social channels benefits everyone: In-house influencers bring recognition, personality, and trustworthiness to the brand, creators get the company’s editorial support, and audiences get more engaging content. Talent-driven journalism does present many opportunities. But even as audience strategist Báez acknowledges the positives — news feels more personal, journalists connect directly with an audience, more accessibility, and the chance for people from underrepresented backgrounds to build their own following — she cautions that the practice also poses many challenges for journalists and news-seekers. First, Báez says, social media takes place on “borrowed land,” and is beholden to platforms with changing algorithms that generally deprioritize news. That makes it harder for outlets to ensure their coverage reaches the intended audiences, and for audiences to access the perspectives for which they’re searching. Additionally, Báez points out, not every journalist wants to be a public-facing personality. The shift toward news influencers favors extroverts over highly skilled journalists who do critical behind-the-scenes investigative work. It also increases the likelihood of harassment, burnout, and instability, especially for journalists from marginalized backgrounds. And, as with many shifts in media, this shift favors those who already have social capital, often white, male, well-connected voices, while others still struggle for visibility and support, she explains. Time will tell whether news organizations can invest in influencers to effectively benefit reporters and audiences alike. “Done right, it could strengthen journalism,” says Báez. “Done poorly, it could widen existing inequalities and destabilize an already fragile industry.”

Title: Buy Or Sell Nvidia Stock Ahead Of Earnings?

More in the Cross Hall of the White House during an event on "Investing in America" on April 30, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump was joined by CEOs to highlight companies and their investments in the United States during the event. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is scheduled to announce its Q1 earnings towards the end of May. The consensus estimates earnings of $0.89 per share, reflecting a 45% increase from the previous year, while revenues are projected to rise by 65% year-over-year to $43 billion. This growth is expected to be fueled by sustained high demand for the company’s GPU chips utilized in generative AI applications. In the prior quarter, Nvidia reported having significantly increased the large-scale production of its latest Blackwell AI supercomputers. These new chips, equipped with advanced AI features and premium pricing, could potentially enhance top-line growth throughout Q1 FY’26 (FY’25 concluded in January 2025), while also improving margins. However, investors will keep a close eye on Nvidia’s future projections, especially given the growing uncertainty regarding U.S. trade policies and tariffs affecting key trading partners. The Trump administration is also considering tighter regulations on AI chip exports through newly introduced AI diffusion rules, which could represent a considerable threat to Nvidia’s long-term growth by restricting sales in crucial international markets. Separately, the past three years portend a 60% chance of a positive move, see: How Will D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) Stock React To Its Upcoming Earnings? Nvidia currently has a market capitalization of $2.7 trillion. Revenue over the previous twelve months amounted to $130 billion, alongside an operational profit of $81 billion and a net income of $73 billion. That said, for those seeking upside potential with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and delivering returns exceeding 91% since its inception.

NVDA 1D, 5D, and 21D Post-Earnings Return A relatively less risky approach (though not effective if the correlation is weak) is to examine the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings, identify a pair that exhibits the highest correlation, and execute the suitable trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D show the strongest correlation, a trader can position themselves “long” for the following 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data extracted from the 5-year and 3-year (more recent) historical performance. Please note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. NVDA Correlation Between 1D, 5D, and 21D Historical Returns At times, the performance of peers can impact the stock's reaction following earnings. In fact, the pricing in may commence prior to the earnings announcement.

Title: Microsoft is stealing Amazon's thunder in the cloud — and AI

With almost $10 trillion in combined market cap across Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META), last week’s Big Tech earnings weren’t just dry corporate updates. They were market-moving events. And despite a few wobbles, the takeaway is clear: AI momentum and operational efficiency are driving a new wave of tech profitability, even as tariffs loom and economic uncertainty lingers. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the widening gap between Wall Street and Main Street, the shift to AI-powered enterprise is shaping up as the gold rush of this decade. Microsoft led the charge, with the stock jumping more than 11% for the week, fueled by surging cloud and AI demand — and management’s clear, detailed take on both in the earnings call. Amazon, for its part, whipsawed before and after its earnings report, but closed the week up about 1%, buoyed by strong margin growth. Only Apple stock slipped, falling 2% as investors weighed a cautious June quarter outlook and a potential $900 million tariff hit. Together, the releases and earnings calls painted a nuanced but largely bullish picture of where Big Tech is headed — and how it’s already reshaping both the market and the macro narrative. If there was one company that seized the AI narrative last week, it was Microsoft. The company delivered a blowout quarter — and an even more confident call — that made clear it’s not just riding the AI boom, but helping define it. Azure cloud revenue grew 33% year-over-year, reaccelerating from the previous quarter and beating both internal targets and Wall Street estimates. Almost half of that growth came from AI workloads — a level of transparency that reinforced Microsoft’s clout in the enterprise AI stack. CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood leaned into the idea that AI and non-AI workloads are increasingly indistinguishable, especially among digital-native customers building everything on unified infrastructure. Microsoft’s $80 billion forecast for fiscal 2025 capital expenditures remains intact, with plans to expand further in 2026 — quieting any talk of a slowdown in data center investment. Wedbush called it an “Aaron Judge-like quarter” and raised its price target 8.4% to $515. Crucially, Microsoft didn’t just post strong results — it articulated a confident, forward-looking vision of how AI is already translating into revenue. In a week where every tech CEO had to tell an AI story, Microsoft made its pitch look not just polished, but inevitable. Amazon’s first-quarter results were strong by the numbers: Revenue rose 9% to $155.7 billion, net income rose to $1.59 per share, and operating margins hit a record 11.8%, largely on the back of AWS, Amazon’s profit engine. But with initiatives spanning AI chips, Alexa upgrades, Project Kuiper satellites, Prime Day savings on snail-mucin moisturizers, and even a new James Bond film, Amazon remains a catch-all for tech’s most ambitious threads — which may make its story harder to parse for investors. CEO Andy Jassy emphasized Amazon’s ability to thrive even in a softening economy, pointing to consumer demand strength, faster Prime delivery, and $500 million in customer savings during global sales events. He struck a confident tone on AWS as well, convincinly describing it as a “multi-hundred-billion-dollar” opportunity over time. Still, the cloud business grew just 17% year-over-year — solid, especially off a large base, but slower than Azure’s 33%, and short of the expectations that Microsoft’s blowout quarter had quietly raised. Analysts flagged uncertainty around near-term earnings power, as well as questions about potential tariff impacts and the timeline for Kuiper’s returns. As Deutsche Bank (DB) put it, Amazon’s sheer scale helps it weather global disruption — but that same sprawl can make it tough to gauge momentum or profitability with precision. AWS remains the largest cloud provider — a position it’s held for over a decade, a default authority — and management cited capacity constraints as a limiting factor, though relief may come in the second half of the year. Certainly, the stakes couldn’t be higher. As Jassy noted, we’re still in the early innings of enterprise’s move to the cloud — and that migration is accelerating, powered by AI. Enterprise tech may be the biggest market opportunity of this era, and in that context, “lumpy revenue” is both expected and fair. But with Microsoft setting the pace and reframing what success looks like, Amazon’s longtime dominance feels just a bit less assured. In the meantime, Amazon is betting that its everything-now strategy will pay off later. Of course, this isn’t a zero-sum game: The enterprise AI market is big enough to crown multiple winners, and both Microsoft and Amazon will undoubtedly be among the biggest. But in a moment where narrative clarity matters, Microsoft pulled ahead. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

With almost $10 trillion in combined market cap across Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META), last week’s Big Tech earnings weren’t just dry corporate updates. They were market-moving events. And despite a few wobbles, the takeaway is clear: AI momentum and operational efficiency are driving a new wave of tech profitability, even as tariffs loom and economic uncertainty lingers. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the widening gap between Wall Street and Main Street, the shift to AI-powered enterprise is shaping up as the gold rush of this decade. Microsoft led the charge, with the stock jumping more than 11% for the week, fueled by surging cloud and AI demand — and management’s clear, detailed take on both in the earnings call. Amazon, for its part, whipsawed before and after its earnings report, but closed the week up about 1%, buoyed by strong margin growth. Only Apple stock slipped, falling 2% as investors weighed a cautious June quarter outlook and a potential $900 million tariff hit. Together, the releases and earnings calls painted a nuanced but largely bullish picture of where Big Tech is headed — and how it’s already reshaping both the market and the macro narrative. If there was one company that seized the AI narrative last week, it was Microsoft. The company delivered a blowout quarter — and an even more confident call — that made clear it’s not just riding the AI boom, but helping define it. Azure cloud revenue grew 33% year-over-year, reaccelerating from the previous quarter and beating both internal targets and Wall Street estimates. Almost half of that growth came from AI workloads — a level of transparency that reinforced Microsoft’s clout in the enterprise AI stack. CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood leaned into the idea that AI and non-AI workloads are increasingly indistinguishable, especially among digital-native customers building everything on unified infrastructure. Microsoft’s $80 billion forecast for fiscal 2025 capital expenditures remains intact, with plans to expand further in 2026 — quieting any talk of a slowdown in data center investment. Wedbush called it an “Aaron Judge-like quarter” and raised its price target 8.4% to $515. Crucially, Microsoft didn’t just post strong results — it articulated a confident, forward-looking vision of how AI is already translating into revenue.

Title: For GenZers working in clean energy, DOGE's cuts mean finding creative career pivots
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-zers-clean-energy-climate-job-cuts-doge-trump-musk-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-05T08:17:01Z

In just four months, Aaron Yang's young career in renewable energy had hit the highs and lows you might expect of a more seasoned worker. Yang, 22, graduated from New York University in December and landed a job at the Department of Energy in an office doling out grants to nascent clean technologies like hydrogen, advanced nuclear, and long-duration battery storage. By April, he had been fired, rehired, and accepted a voluntary buyout under President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's efforts to shrink the federal government. Renewable energy programs were a top target, with Trump on January 20 signing an executive order freezing funding authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden's signature climate law. Since then, thousands of federal employees working on clean energy, environmental justice, and climate science have been terminated. "Throughout college, I worked toward this career path," Yang told Business Insider in April at a career fair in Washington, DC. "Then I got into the DOE and felt that was a huge achievement. So to then immediately get laid off has been tough to reconcile." Yang is among many Gen Zers entering a job market defined by hiring slumps in industries like tech, finance, and consulting. The upheaval in Washington has further clouded their career paths, particularly in the renewable energy industry, as tariffs and frozen federal funding have led companies to delay new projects or scrap them altogether. White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers cited Friday's strong jobs report to say that Trump was bringing jobs back "and making America the world's manufacturing powerhouse once again." A DOE spokesperson told Business Insider that the department was still reviewing its organizational structure to align with the president's priorities. "The American people provided President Trump with a mandate to govern and to unleash affordable, abundant, and secure American energy," they said, adding, "No final decisions have been made and multiple plans are still being considered." At a job fair during DC's inaugural Climate Week, more than 50 companies and trade associations met some 1,200 job seekers. They lined up to chat with firms including Amazon, the solar manufacturer Qcells, and Arcadia, an AI analytics platform for energy. Zainab Mirza organized the job fair for Clean Energy for America, a trade group that lobbies Congress and the administration on issues like protecting tax credits for renewable energy. Mirza experienced similar career setbacks as Yang. She graduated from American University in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, which thwarted her plans to pursue a career in international development overseas. In February, she was laid off from the DOE's Loan Program Office, where she had just become a full-time employee after being a contractor for two years. The slashed investments go beyond the federal government. In the first three months of 2025, companies canceled, closed, or downsized projects totaling nearly $8 billion in investment. This affected 16 new factories for electric vehicles, batteries, and hydrogen — more than three times the cancellation rate over the previous 30 months, according to an analysis by E2, a business group that advocates for clean energy, and the think tank Atlas Public Policy. "If this self-inflicted and unnecessary market uncertainty continues, we'll almost certainly see more projects paused, more construction halted, and more job opportunities disappear," Michael Timberlake, spokesperson for E2, said in a statement. Between January 2024 and March 2025, the number of new job postings across renewable power — including solar, wind, nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal — dropped by more than 20%, indicating a slowdown in labor demand, an analysis Revelio Labs conducted for BI showed. Some companies continue to invest in the energy transition. In March, 10 solar, EV, and transmission manufacturing plants were announced, which, if built, could create 5,000 permanent jobs. That includes Tesla's plans to build a battery factory near Houston. Despite the hurdles, Mirza was optimistic about the future. While the DOE is expected to be less active and shift away from wind and solar projects, it may help finance nuclear, geothermal, and power grid resilience. Katie Mehnert, CEO of ALLY Energy, an online career and networking platform, said the energy industry is always changing. Mehnert lives in Texas, where layoffs are also hitting the oil and gas sector. The rise of artificial intelligence is ushering in another transformation of how businesses operate. But there will be jobs, Mehnert said. ALLY recently partnered with Parallel, an AI-driven jobs platform that aims to make job hunting more efficient and better match people's expertise to openings. "We need more energy, we need sustainable energy, we need affordable energy," Mehnert said. "And there's plenty of money that's been deployed. Now we need to find the best talent and match them with opportunities quicker. That way, we can minimize the disruption in job marketing and people's personal lives." Mirza, for her part, encouraged young people to be open-minded to positions they may not have considered. "I'm not sure where I want to go next," Mirza said. "I've had a blast putting this event together. I think that people here can meet with employers they might not have heard of or thought about, or a skill that they haven't developed. There are upskilling opportunities. There are incubators. Maybe you've had an idea for so long, and now you can test it out." Yang said he's open-minded, too. Although his time at DOE was focused on long-duration energy storage like batteries, he is open to other technologies. During his undergrad internships, Yang worked on transmission infrastructure, sales teams, and policy development. For now, Yang decided to accelerate his pursuit of a master's in energy, policy, and climate at Johns Hopkins University while looking for a full time job. He's come close several times, but ultimately, someone with more experience was hired. "That's no fault of my own," Yang said. "There are a ton of talented people out there right now, and I haven't worked full-time yet. So I'm cautiously optimistic. I don't know what my future holds." Do you have a story to share?

Title: Market Mayhem and Recovery: Wall Street’s Wild Ride in 2025

On April 2, President Trump stunned the markets by announcing unexpectedly steep tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners. The reaction was swift and severe — the S&P 500 plummeted nearly 12%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost about 4,600 points in just four days. The sudden escalation raised fears that Trump was willing to risk a recession to reshape the global trade landscape.(Source: AP) Despite the initial crash, the U.S. stock market began to recover quickly. By early May, the S&P 500 had climbed back to the levels seen on April 2. While still over 7% below its all-time high, the market’s rapid bounce-back was just as unexpected and dramatic as the fall that preceded it. A major turning point came on April 9 when Trump announced a “90-day PAUSE” on most tariffs, excluding those targeting China. This announcement led to a massive one-day rally, with the S&P 500 jumping 9.5% — one of its best performances ever. However, controversy followed as Trump had posted on Truth Social earlier that day calling it a “great time to buy,” raising questions about timing and market influence. Following the pause, the market saw a mix of optimism and confusion. Trump spoke about both negotiating and enforcing tariffs to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., a seemingly contradictory stance. Still, signs of easing tensions, particularly with China, and the reduction of tariffs on cars and consumer electronics helped calm some investor nerves. The sharp stock selloff after "Liberation Day" also shook other financial markets. U.S. Treasury bond prices fell, and the dollar weakened, reflecting a loss of investor confidence in America’s financial safety. Trump himself acknowledged that bond market jitters contributed to his decision to delay tariffs, as investors grew increasingly uneasy. Despite shaken consumer confidence, economic data painted a stronger picture. April saw 177,000 new jobs added, supporting the view that the economy remained resilient. The Federal Reserve, which had already cut rates three times in late 2024, chose to hold steady, watching the evolving impact of trade policy. Nonetheless, markets continue to price in the likelihood of three more cuts by year-end. Even amid uncertainty, U.S. companies have posted surprisingly strong earnings. Nearly 75% of S&P 500 firms, including giants like Microsoft and Meta, beat profit expectations, with overall earnings growth nearing 13%. However, many CEOs are hesitant about the future, offering cautious or dual forecasts — as United Airlines did — due to unpredictable trade policies. With the tariff pause nearing expiration, volatility could return swiftly if no lasting agreements are reached.

Title: The Oracle of Omaha Steps Down

After over six decades at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, the end of this year marks the finale: Investment legend Warren Buffett is stepping down. Buffett weathered market storms and geopolitical turbulence by translating the Bretton Woods order into a consistent portfolio strategy. As always, it was business as usual: Around 20,000 Berkshire shareholders filled the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska, to capacity -- the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders’ meeting was underway. Known in investment circles as the “Woodstock” of investors, the event traditionally unfolds as a whirlwind tour through the American economy. The accompanying exhibition of Berkshire’s investments showcases what resonates with American consumers: Apple, Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz, or American Express -- a veritable trade show of national brand leaders. Here, retail and institutional investors alike are reassured that Omaha remains true to its roots: conservative, grounded, quintessentially American, and always in tune with the consumer. This strategy has been managed from Berkshire’s headquarters at Blackstone Plaza. This approach has propelled Berkshire’s stock to a staggering 4.4 million percent increase since its transformation from a textile company into an investment fund in 1962. The never-split original share recently hit a price of $800,000 -- a figure worthy of the Guinness Book of Records. By comparison, the broad S&P 500 index “only” grew by 31,000 percent over the same period. A Routine with a Bombshell Let’s pause the number games and return to Omaha. Attendees of the shareholders’ meeting on May 3, 2025, quickly realized they were witnessing a turning point: At 94, Warren Buffett announced his resignation as chairman. By year’s end, 62-year-old Canadian Greg Abel, currently vice chairman for non-insurance operations, will take the reins. This will take some getting used to, as Buffett is a stock market institution, a calming force in the frenetic world of Wall Street, from which he maintained a safe distance -- not just geographically, with his base in far-off Nebraska. Buffett shaped the investment landscape like few others over his 63-year tenure. His strategy was clear-cut: a heavy focus on equity investments in U.S. market leaders, almost entirely eschewing bonds, and aligning the fund’s cash position with the waves of the credit cycle. Berkshire cashed out investments when strategically prudent or when the economy’s credit engine overheated. This disciplined oscillation between U.S. dollar reserves and aggressive equity buildups after market corrections has outperformed the classic 60/40 stock-bond portfolio by leaps and bounds. A deep understanding of economic cycles, industry growth, and specific company valuations forged an unbeatable alliance that turned countless loyal shareholders into millionaires. Embedded in the Bretton Woods Framework With an estimated fortune of $160 billion, Buffett, the world’s fifth-richest person, remained true to himself. His conservative investment style is mirrored in his personal life: no scandals, three children from two marriages, and he still lives in the Omaha house he bought in 1958. In soccer terms, his strategy might be called a “controlled offensive.” Buffett’s investment thesis was rooted in the post-war Bretton Woods order, betting on the dominant U.S. market -- and he was spot-on. The U.S. dollar’s dominance remains unbroken, still a safe-haven currency in crises. U.S. companies like Apple, Domino’s Pizza, or Chevron lead their market segments, aided by a U.S. regulatory framework that welcomes foreign capital with open arms. In short, Buffett’s framework: Capital is mobile, the U.S. offers an open market system combining liquidity and growth, and the domestic currency, as a cash buffer, never faced serious devaluation risks compared to global competitors. This stability was underpinned by decades of U.S. interventionist foreign policy, leaving no room for doubt. Berkshire became a meta-investment structure, enabling retail investors to back the U.S. market as a whole through government-backed stock ownership programs. Monetary Policy as a Multiplier Berkshire also capitalized on another insight: Investment success hinges not only on analysis but also on systemic factors. These lie in the design of the global monetary order. With the end of the gold standard in 1971 (Nixon Shock), global credit creation accelerated. Since then, the global money supply (M2 -- cash, checking deposits, and short-term savings) has grown by an average of 6.9% annually. The fiat standard -- credit creation without full backing by assets like gold or commodities -- unleashed waves of liquidity. These inflated nominal asset valuations, turning assets like real estate into “savings banks” to preserve purchasing power against currency devaluation. Buffett recognized this liquidity mechanism, effectively “front-running” the money-printing machine with his investment style. A New Investment Regime The handover comes amid significant geopolitical upheaval. With his tariff push, U.S. President Donald Trump has exposed a long-simmering issue: a crisis in U.S. Treasuries as a globally accepted safe asset. Markets are now pricing new risk premiums into asset classes. Volatility is rising, and governments, central banks, and major capital pools are increasingly eyeing safe-haven assets like gold and Bitcoin. Capital rotation into these assets reflects efforts to reduce credit default risks, which lurk like a ticking time bomb under traditional portfolio structures. How will Berkshire Hathaway navigate geopolitical uncertainty and inflation risks? During the COVID lockdowns and expansive monetary policy, Buffett foresaw rising inflation and briefly positioned Berkshire in the gold sector, investing in Barrick Gold in 2020 -- a notable move for the traditionally gold-skeptical Buffett. Yet, by Q4 of that year, the firm exited the position. This brief gold foray and swift retreat seem, in hindsight, like an acknowledgment of an emerging monetary system crisis. However, Buffett’s team may have been reluctant to admit that a radical devaluation of dollar collateral -- a potential regime change -- was already underway. Will Berkshire steer toward safe havens? The question looms: How will the new leadership under Greg Abel handle safe-haven assets in a shifting global landscape? Will Omaha continue to bet on U.S. policy’s ability to consolidate budgets and fiscal frameworks in the spirit of free markets? And will it trust in a U.S. economic comeback under President Trump? Financial analysts, media, and policymakers will closely watch the strategic decisions of Berkshire’s new leadership. For Berkshire’s over one million shareholders worldwide, Buffett’s exit marks the start of a new chapter, fueled by hope that the controlled offensive that made the firm strong will succeed in the evolving financial world. The meeting closed with a cryptic remark from the Oracle of Omaha. Commenting on recent trade policy developments and current crises, Buffett hinted: “It may be that things happen in the United States that cause us to own a lot of other currencies.” Time will tell how this pointed warning will manifest in Berkshire’s portfolio in the months ahead.

A New Investment Regime The handover comes amid significant geopolitical upheaval. With his tariff push, U.S. President Donald Trump has exposed a long-simmering issue: a crisis in U.S. Treasuries as a globally accepted safe asset. Markets are now pricing new risk premiums into asset classes. Volatility is rising, and governments, central banks, and major capital pools are increasingly eyeing safe-haven assets like gold and Bitcoin. Capital rotation into these assets reflects efforts to reduce credit default risks, which lurk like a ticking time bomb under traditional portfolio structures. How will Berkshire Hathaway navigate geopolitical uncertainty and inflation risks? During the COVID lockdowns and expansive monetary policy, Buffett foresaw rising inflation and briefly positioned Berkshire in the gold sector, investing in Barrick Gold in 2020 -- a notable move for the traditionally gold-skeptical Buffett. Yet, by Q4 of that year, the firm exited the position. This brief gold foray and swift retreat seem, in hindsight, like an acknowledgment of an emerging monetary system crisis. However, Buffett’s team may have been reluctant to admit that a radical devaluation of dollar collateral -- a potential regime change -- was already underway. Will Berkshire steer toward safe havens? The question looms: How will the new leadership under Greg Abel handle safe-haven assets in a shifting global landscape? Will Omaha continue to bet on U.S. policy’s ability to consolidate budgets and fiscal frameworks in the spirit of free markets? And will it trust in a U.S. economic comeback under President Trump? Financial analysts, media, and policymakers will closely watch the strategic decisions of Berkshire’s new leadership. For Berkshire’s over one million shareholders worldwide, Buffett’s exit marks the start of a new chapter, fueled by hope that the controlled offensive that made the firm strong will succeed in the evolving financial world. The meeting closed with a cryptic remark from the Oracle of Omaha. Commenting on recent trade policy developments and current crises, Buffett hinted: “It may be that things happen in the United States that cause us to own a lot of other currencies.” Time will tell how this pointed warning will manifest in Berkshire’s portfolio in the months ahead.

Title: Earnings Season And Waiting On The Fed

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Beyond tariffs and earnings, the big event will be the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday. Markets ... More expect no rate changes from the Federal Reserve. The focus will be on Chair Powell’s comments and whether June is a likely time to lower rates again. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) After the busiest week of earnings releases, almost three-quarters of companies have released results. 76% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. This earnings season slows this week, with 93 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. In addition to earnings, the Federal Reserve (Fed) meets on Wednesday. S&P 500 Earnings Season According to FactSet data, the healthcare, consumer discretionary, communication services, and technology sectors contributed most positively to last week's earnings growth improvement. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is 12.8% year-over-year, above the 7.2% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the expected earnings and sales growth rates for calendar years 2025 and 2026 have declined despite the better-than-expected first-quarter results so far. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Better tariff news combined with strong earnings sent stocks higher by 2.9% last week. After this week’s rally, the S&P 500 sits 7.5% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. The group is 17% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Total Returns Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and account for a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and Amazon.com (AMZN) reported last week, and all but Amazon outperformed expectations. While Amazon came up short, the earnings pace was robust, and the stock was still higher for the week. Four of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week: Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) on Wednesday; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) on Thursday. Nvidia (NVDA) is the last of the magnificent 7 stocks yet to report and is not expected until the end of May. Magnificent 7 Earnings Beyond the Magnificent 7, this week of the reporting season has some notable companies scheduled, including Clorox (CLX), Uber Technologies (UBER), Emerson Electric (EMR), and Walt Disney (DIS). Earnings Insights By Sector According to FactSet data, the healthcare, consumer discretionary, communication services, and technology sectors were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings. It was a broad-based improvement in earnings as every sector except energy saw better earnings growth rates last week. Earnings Growth By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.8% is above the 4.4% expectations. The technology sector is expected to provide the most robust revenue growth. Sales Growth By Sector As discussed in a previous piece, a surge in imports was a massive headwind to GDP growth. Net exports were a whopping 4.8 percentage point drag on the economy. According to Goldman Sachs, this is the most significant drag from net exports on record as companies raced to import goods to avoid the coming tariffs. GDP Components Due to the trade distortion, final sales to private domestic purchasers are a better measure to watch, and they continued to perform well at 3% growth. This measure excludes the impacts of trade, inventories, and government spending, so it does a better job of measuring the activity of the U.S. private sector. Measures Of Economic Activity Monthly nonfarm payrolls grew by an above-consensus 177,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%. Despite the 58,000 downward revision of payroll jobs over the previous months, the monthly jobs report has to be considered solid. Monthly Jobs Report The GDP report, especially when combined with the monthly jobs growth, does not signal an imminent recession despite the -0.3% decline in headline economic activity. This does not mean that we won’t eventually see more economic slowing due to tariffs, but this isn’t it yet. Consumer spending did moderate somewhat, so it is still fair to say the economy was softening a bit even before the tariff impact. Markets will remain very attuned to newsflow around the tariffs since the size and duration of the tariffs impact the extent of the economic growth headwind. Beyond tariffs, the big event will be the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday. Markets expect no rate changes from the Federal Reserve, especially after the better-than-expected jobs report. The focus will be on Chair Powell’s comments and whether June is a likely time to lower rates again. Expected Fed Rate Cuts Despite the negative GDP results for the first quarter, the economy is not in a recession. This view is further bolstered by the better-than-expected job growth reported last week. The Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) annual meeting and first quarter earnings release on Saturday were eventful. Warren Buffett shocked the crowd with the announcement that he plans to resign from his role as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at year-end. Disclosure: Glenview Trust holds many stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies.

May 04, 2025 08:47 ET | Source: Nitric Boost Nitric Boost NEW YORK, May 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- If you’re searching for the best nitric oxide supplements for men, you're not alone. In 2025, nitric oxide (NO) boosters are among the most in-demand health products for men looking to enhance blood flow, energy, athletic performance, and even support for erectile dysfunction (ED). But what exactly is nitric oxide, and why does it matter so much? Nitric oxide is a naturally occurring molecule in your body that plays a crucial role in vascular health. It helps relax and dilate blood vessels, allowing for improved circulation—a function that impacts everything from your stamina at the gym to your performance in the bedroom. Unfortunately, as men age, natural NO production declines, often leading to fatigue, reduced endurance, poor muscle recovery, and even symptoms of ED. That’s where nitric oxide supplements come in. Designed to stimulate NO production through ingredients like L-arginine, L-citrulline, and beetroot extract, these supplements help improve oxygen delivery, nutrient flow, and vascular function. Whether you're an athlete chasing better pumps or someone looking to restore youthful energy and performance, the right nitric oxide booster can make a major difference. And among the dozens of options on the market, one supplement continues to lead the pack in 2025… Enter: Nitric Boost Ultra — a cutting-edge NO supplement formulated for maximum blood flow, energy, and erectile support. This guide explores the science behind nitric oxide, the benefits it delivers for men’s health, and why Nitric Boost Ultra stands out as the best nitric oxide supplement for energy, endurance, and ED support this year. Meet Nitric Boost Ultra – The Best Nitric Oxide Supplement for Men When it comes to choosing the best nitric oxide supplement for men, Nitric Boost Ultra consistently ranks as the top choice in 2025. This advanced formula is specifically engineered to support optimal blood flow, muscle pumps, stamina, and erectile health — making it a powerful ally for any man looking to reclaim energy, confidence, and vitality. Why Nitric Boost Ultra Stands Out Unlike generic NO boosters, Nitric Boost Ultra goes beyond basic L-arginine formulas. It’s designed with a synergistic blend of science-backed ingredients that work together to enhance nitric oxide production, increase oxygen delivery, and improve vascular performance without the crash or jitteriness often associated with stimulant-heavy products.

Pine Bark Extract (Pycnogenol) Primary Function: Enhances nitric oxide retentionKnown for its antioxidant properties, pine bark extract helps sustain nitric oxide levels in the blood longer, leading to better vascular tone, improved erectile quality, and faster post-exercise recovery. Niacin (Vitamin B3) Primary Function: Improves blood vessel flexibilityNiacin supports vascular health by reducing inflammation and improving blood lipid profiles. It works synergistically with the other ingredients to optimize circulation and reduce fatigue. Why This Blend Works: This unique combination addresses every aspect of nitric oxide production and utilization — from boosting initial levels to sustaining them longer and improving blood vessel responsiveness. Whether you’re battling low energy, erectile dysfunction, or sluggish recovery, Nitric Boost Ultra helps restore male performance at its core.

Try it today! How Nitric Oxide Works – The Science Behind NO Boosters Nitric oxide (NO) is a naturally occurring molecule in the human body, essential for many physiological processes — especially those tied to circulation, energy, and male performance. Understanding how nitric oxide works helps explain why supplements like Nitric Boost Ultra have become the go-to solution for men looking to improve stamina, blood flow, and even erectile dysfunction (ED). What Is Nitric Oxide (NO)? Nitric oxide is a vasodilator — a compound that signals blood vessels to relax and widen. This increased vessel diameter allows more blood, oxygen, and nutrients to flow to vital areas of the body. NO is synthesized from amino acids like L-Arginine and L-Citrulline and is crucial for: How Nitric Oxide Boosters Work Nitric oxide supplements — like Nitric Boost Ultra — work by supplying the body with precursors that stimulate NO production naturally. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works: 1. L-Arginine & L-Citrulline These amino acids are converted into nitric oxide via the endothelial cells lining your blood vessels. This process leads to: 2. Beet Root & Other Plant-Based Boosters Beetroot is rich in nitrates, which convert into nitric oxide through a different pathway — the nitrate-nitrite-NO cycle. This dual approach provides: 3. Synergistic Support from Key Vitamins & Botanicals Ingredients like Niacin (Vitamin B3) help relax blood vessels and improve lipid profiles, while herbs like Tribulus Terrestris and Pine Bark Extract boost natural testosterone and enhance libido — making NO boosters even more effective for male sexual health. Fast-Acting, Long-Lasting Results Once taken, NO boosters quickly absorb into the bloodstream and start enhancing circulation within hours. Over time, consistent use: Nitric Boost Ultra works on all these mechanisms, making it one of the top-rated nitric oxide supplements for men who want to optimize blood flow, muscle function, and sexual performance without pharmaceuticals or side effects. Clinical Studies Supporting Nitric Oxide Supplementation 1. L-Citrulline and Erectile Function A study published in Urology investigated the effects of oral L-citrulline supplementation on men with mild erectile dysfunction (ED). In this single-blind study, participants received a placebo for one month followed by L-citrulline (1.5 g/day) for another month. The results showed that 50% of the men experienced an improvement in erection hardness from a score of 3 (mild ED) to 4 (normal erectile function) during the L-citrulline phase, compared to only 8.3% during the placebo phase. Additionally, the mean number of intercourses per month increased significantly with L-citrulline supplementation. Another study explored the combination of L-citrulline and transresveratrol in men with ED who were already using phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i). This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover pilot study found that the combination therapy significantly improved erectile function compared to placebo, suggesting a potential synergistic effect. 2. Beetroot Juice and Blood Pressure A systematic review and meta-analysis examined the impact of nitrate-rich beetroot juice on blood pressure in individuals with arterial hypertension. The analysis included seven studies with a total of 218 participants. The findings indicated that beetroot juice supplementation led to a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) by approximately 4.95 mmHg. However, the effect on diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was not statistically significant. Another study focused on the acute and short-term effects of nitrate-rich beetroot juice ingestion in postmenopausal women with arterial hypertension. The results demonstrated that both acute and one-week supplementation enhanced cardiovascular responses following aerobic exercise, highlighting the potential benefits of beetroot juice in this population. Nitric Boost Ultra vs Other Top Nitric Oxide Supplements When it comes to nitric oxide supplements, not all formulas are created equal. While many products claim to boost nitric oxide levels, only a few deliver clinically effective doses, proven ingredients, and measurable results. Here's how Nitric Boost Ultra compares head-to-head with other top-rated nitric oxide boosters in the market. Ingredients & Clinical Doses Nitric Boost Ultra stands out for including clinically validated doses of L-Arginine and L-Citrulline, the two most important amino acids involved in nitric oxide synthesis. Unlike other products that use proprietary blends or underdose key ingredients, Nitric Boost Ultra clearly lists: Most competitors—like SuperBeets or Neo40—rely heavily on beetroot alone, without the dual-action benefits of arginine + citrulline. Pre-workout formulas like N.O. XT may include these aminos but often at lower or less bioavailable doses. Delivery Method Nitric Boost Ultra is delivered in easy-to-swallow capsules, optimized for gradual absorption and longer-lasting effects. This method avoids the rapid spike and crash often experienced with lozenges, powders, or sugary beet-based drinks. Nitric Boost Ultra's capsule format ensures no mess, no mixing, and no blood sugar spikes—just smooth, consistent nitric oxide support throughout the day. Third-Party Testing & Purity Purity and transparency are key when choosing a top nitric oxide booster. Nitric Boost Ultra is: Many other brands skip third-party testing or hide their ingredient doses behind proprietary blends. With Nitric Boost Ultra, what you see is what you get—no fillers, no gimmicks. Price vs. Value While some nitric oxide supplements may seem cheaper upfront, they often cut corners on ingredient quality or dosing. Nitric Boost Ultra offers premium ingredients, clinical dosing, and a comprehensive formula that supports: And all of this is backed by a 60-day money-back guarantee—making it a risk-free investment in your health. Bottom Line: Why Nitric Boost Ultra Leads the Pack If you’re seeking the best nitric oxide supplement for men’s health, especially for ED support, energy, and peak performance, Nitric Boost Ultra delivers where others fall short. With clinical dosing, clean formulation, and proven ingredients, it’s engineered for real results—not just hype. Order Nitric Boost Ultra now and experience the nitric oxide difference Health Benefits of Nitric Oxide Supplements for Men When it comes to men’s health, few compounds are as impactful as nitric oxide (NO).

If you want to improve your energy, blood flow, sexual performance, heart health, or workout recovery, the answer is YES — nitric oxide supplements like Nitric Boost Ultra are designed to help modern men perform and feel their best, naturally. Feel stronger, think clearer, and live better — take charge of your health with Nitric Boost Ultra today. Nitric Oxide Benefits for Males – Why It Matters Most After 40 As men age, their bodies experience a gradual decline in nitric oxide (NO) production — a key molecule that affects everything from blood circulation to sexual health, muscle performance, and even heart function. By the time you reach 40 and beyond, this drop in NO can begin to show up in ways that directly impact your quality of life. That’s where nitric oxide supplements like Nitric Boost Ultra come in. These boosters are specifically designed to replenish NO levels and restore youthful performance across multiple health areas. 1. Improved Erectile Function and Sexual Vitality One of the most talked-about nitric oxide benefits for males is its direct link to stronger, longer-lasting erections. NO relaxes blood vessels and improves blood flow — a critical factor in achieving and maintaining erections. Men over 40 often experience ED or performance issues not due to lack of desire, but because blood flow is compromised. A high-quality nitric oxide booster for ED, such as Nitric Boost Ultra: This makes nitric oxide one of the best natural alternatives to ED medications — without harsh side effects. 2. Cardiovascular Health and Blood Pressure Support After 40, men are more susceptible to hypertension, heart disease, and circulatory issues. Since nitric oxide plays a key role in vasodilation (the widening of blood vessels), boosting NO levels can: Regular use of nitric oxide supplements has been associated with better heart performance and lower vascular resistance, helping you age with strength and resilience. 3. Enhanced Physical Performance and Muscle Recovery Whether you’re staying fit or just trying to keep up with your kids, muscle fatigue becomes more noticeable after 40. Nitric oxide helps: By improving circulation and oxygen delivery, NO boosters like Nitric Boost Ultra are perfect for maintaining strength and physical ability well into your 40s, 50s, and beyond. 4. Cognitive Function and Mental Sharpness The gut-brain axis and circulatory function also play a huge role in how you think and feel. As NO supports blood flow to the brain, it can improve: This is particularly helpful for aging men juggling careers, families, and health — NO supplements are a hidden gem in natural cognitive support. 5. Energy and Anti-Aging Effects Fatigue and slowed metabolism are common complaints after 40. By supporting mitochondrial efficiency and cellular energy production, nitric oxide helps: The anti-aging effects of nitric oxide go beyond the surface — they’re about staying functional, vibrant, and energized every single day. Why Nitric Boost Ultra Is Ideal for Men 40+ What makes Nitric Boost Ultra a standout choice for men over 40 is its clean, high-impact formulation: Nitric Oxide Side Effects – What You Should Know Before Taking a NO Booster As nitric oxide supplements like Nitric Boost Ultra continue gaining popularity for blood flow support, workout enhancement, and ED relief, it’s essential to understand the potential side effects and how to use them safely. While most people tolerate nitric oxide boosters well, being informed ensures you can maximize the benefits without unwanted surprises. Are There Any Common Side Effects? Generally, natural nitric oxide supplements are considered safe for healthy adults when taken as directed. However, some individuals may experience mild side effects, particularly when first starting or when taking high doses. Possible side effects may include: These effects are usually temporary and tend to subside as the body adjusts. What Causes These Side Effects? Most side effects stem from the vasodilation process, where blood vessels widen due to increased nitric oxide. This can lead to changes in blood pressure or temporary shifts in circulation. Stimulant-free formulas like Nitric Boost Ultra, which uses natural vasodilators (L-arginine, beetroot, pine bark), are generally easier on the body compared to synthetic or caffeine-loaded options. How to Minimize Risk To enjoy the benefits of nitric oxide safely, follow these guidelines: If you have a pre-existing heart condition or are on blood pressure medications, consult a physician before starting any nitric oxide booster. Who Should Be Cautious? Although NO supplements for men offer amazing benefits, they may not be suitable for: Nitric Boost Ultra is non-GMO, gluten-free, soy-free, and made with clinically backed ingredients, which significantly reduces the risk of allergic reactions or sensitivities. Final Thoughts on Safety Used correctly, nitric oxide supplements are a powerful tool to enhance your performance, health, and energy. With its balanced, stimulant-free formula, Nitric Boost Ultra is designed for daily use without harsh side effects. Still, listening to your body and adjusting as needed is key to a safe and satisfying NO supplement experience. Experience clean, science-backed blood flow support — without the jitters or crashes. Try Nitric Boost Ultra today and feel the natural difference.

Below are some of the most frequently asked questions about Nitric Boost Ultra and nitric oxide (NO) boosters in general. 1. How fast does Nitric Boost Ultra work? Most users report feeling initial effects such as improved energy, endurance, or better pumps within the first 30 to 60 minutes of taking Nitric Boost Ultra. Long-term benefits like improved blood flow, stamina, and erectile support may take 2–4 weeks of consistent use. 2. Is Nitric Boost Ultra safe for daily use? Yes. Nitric Boost Ultra uses natural ingredients like L-arginine, beetroot extract, and pine bark, which are generally safe and well-tolerated. It’s stimulant-free and designed for regular daily use without harsh side effects. Still, consult your doctor if you have pre-existing health conditions or are on medication. 3. Can I use NO supplements with other medications? It depends. Since nitric oxide supplements affect blood pressure and circulation, avoid combining them with medications for hypertension, heart disease, or erectile dysfunction unless your physician approves it. 4. Will Nitric Boost Ultra help with erectile dysfunction (ED)? Yes. One of the top benefits of nitric oxide boosters is enhanced blood flow, which directly improves erectile function in men. Many men use Nitric Boost Ultra to improve sexual performance, stamina, and natural arousal. 5. Do nitric oxide supplements cause high blood pressure? Quite the opposite. Nitric oxide relaxes and widens blood vessels, which can lower or stabilize blood pressure in many users. However, if you’re already on blood pressure medication, monitor your levels and consult your doctor before use. 6. Can nitric oxide supplements improve workout performance? Absolutely. Increased NO levels improve oxygen delivery, muscle pump, endurance, and post-workout recovery. Nitric Boost Ultra is a favorite among athletes, runners, and bodybuilders looking for a clean performance edge. 7. Is Nitric Boost Ultra vegan and allergen-free? Yes. It is vegan-friendly, non-GMO, and free from gluten, soy, dairy, and artificial additives—making it ideal for those with dietary restrictions or sensitive systems. 8. Are there any age restrictions?

Many users choose to take breaks every few months, but continuous use is safe when following dosage guidelines. 10. Where can I buy Nitric Boost Ultra?

Title: GoDaddy CEO: Focus On Innovation and Customers and The Rest Takes Care of Itself
URL: https://www.webpronews.com/godaddy-ceo-focus-on-innovation-and-customers-and-the-rest-takes-care-of-itself/
Time Published: 2025-05-04T10:04:30Z

In a climate of growing scrutiny over digital businesses, GoDaddy Inc. delivered what CEO Aman Bhutani described as “a very strong quarter,” posting results that beat Wall Street forecasts on both the top and bottom line for its first quarter of 2024. Yet, despite the solid quarterly performance and reaffirmed full-year outlook, concerns persist among investors and analysts about the sustainability of GoDaddy’s growth, especially against a backcloth of economic headwinds and wavering consumer sentiment. “We beat across all financial metrics in Q1. So a very strong quarter for us. And we reaffirmed our full-year guidance,” Bhutani told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” in an exclusive interview. “Our customers are resilient. Our business is durable. I’ve never been more excited about being at GoDaddy.” GoDaddy’s financial highlights for the quarter included better-than-expected revenue and earnings per share, supported by ongoing demand for the company’s suite of digital tools enabling small businesses and entrepreneurs to establish an online presence. But the company’s shares have come under pressure, sliding in the wake of the report as market participants voiced concerns about underlying trends in customer growth and dependency on price hikes for revenue expansion. Analyst Queries Over Customer Dynamics A number of analysts questioned the optics around declining customer counts and whether increases in average order size or “attach rate”—the number of products per customer—can sustainably drive revenue growth in a competitive and sensitive marketplace. “One analyst has pointed out that the optics are that customer count is coming down. There’s a narrative out there that price drove most of the growth in 2024. And there are questions about whether it’s sustainable this year,” said CNBC host John Fortt. Bhutani responded by shifting the focus from absolute customer numbers to the quality and depth of GoDaddy’s customer relationships. “The idea is to bring high intent customers to GoDaddy, not folks who are looking to buy a cheap domain and then not renew or buy any of our other products,” he said. “We’ve really expanded the product suite over the last few years. We want customers that want to use the breadth of products, and that’s what we’re seeing. We’re seeing increased average order size, improved retention rates, and customers using more of our products.” GoDaddy has been investing in product innovation, including the recent launch of Aero, an AI-powered solution designed to help clients quickly access the full spectrum of GoDaddy’s offerings, from domain registration and website design to e-commerce, digital marketing, and payments. Small Businesses: A Barometer for Economic Mood As a linchpin for millions of small business owners and entrepreneurs, GoDaddy’s performance provides a unique window into the mindset of Main Street businesses—often the first to feel the chill of a softening economy but also the first to rebound when optimism returns. The company conducts regular surveys with its customer base, which Bhutani said gives the company “real-time” insight. “There’s a little bit more tentativeness from our customers on the broader economy. But the core story has not changed, and that story is about our customer being resilient,” Bhutani said. “When we ask them about the economy, yes, they’re a little more concerned, but when we ask them about their business, the majority of them continue to be very bullish about their business.” Industry observers note that GoDaddy operates at a critical juncture for small businesses, many of which rely on the company’s low-cost and essential digital infrastructure. “Our customers need us most for marketing,” Bhutani explained. “A domain name, a website, a little email solution, or just a link to take payments…these are the solutions that are going to be the last things customers give up.” That stickiness, he argued, works in GoDaddy’s favor even in downturns. “Even when a business goes down, a customer doesn’t get rid of their domain name. They’re not giving up the dream,” Bhutani said. “They’re going to keep going and try it again or try something different.” Competitive Positioning Amid Digital Heavyweights Even as GoDaddy faces its usual competition from hosting and web development rivals, broader industry trends are shaping its trajectory. The digital tools segment has been lifted by surging demand for online marketing and commerce solutions; tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google reported robust advertising growth in their latest quarters, reflecting businesses’ increased willingness to optimize digital spending, even amid economic uncertainty. Amazon’s advertising revenue, for instance, rose 90% year-over-year. Asked how GoDaddy fits into this bigger digital transformation, Bhutani outlined an effort to expand beyond core domain registration into “marketing solutions and commerce solutions.” The company’s newest products are designed to capture a greater share of its customers’ digital spending, with lower overall prices and added value for switching or consolidating services. “We’ve got more and more offerings like marketing solutions and commerce solutions as well,” Bhutani said, hinting at a strategy to position GoDaddy not simply as a domain registrar, but as a one-stop digital partner for small businesses. Stock Under Pressure, But Focus Remains on Execution Despite the strategic narrative and the company’s recent investments, GoDaddy stock remains under pressure. Analysts appear unconvinced that product attach and average revenue per user will be enough to drive sustained growth in the event of waning new customer acquisitions—especially in a challenging macroeconomic environment. Bhutani, for his part, remains focused on execution. “My view is let’s focus on the things that we do. Let’s focus on the innovation. Let’s focus on serving our customers. And the rest takes care of itself,” he concluded. He maintains confidence that share price will eventually reflect what the company sees as underlying business strength and resiliency among its core customer base. For now, GoDaddy will be measured less by the hype that once defined the digital domain industry and more by its ability to deepen and lengthen relationships with existing clients—many of whom, in Bhutani’s words, are “not giving up the dream” even in challenging times.

After blockbuster earnings last week from Big Tech, capped by Apple (AAPL-0.39%), Amazon (AMZN-2.87%), and a weekend of Buffett wisdom at Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK.A-0.82%) annual meeting, markets are still digesting what it all means. The Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq are rallying, but Main Street signals remain mixed, and inflation, tariffs, and consumer caution continue to ripple through corporate results. The week ahead won’t quite match the mega-cap frenzy, but there’s still plenty to watch — especially in sectors like energy, pharma, and industrials. It may be a big week for Fed news, too, with the Fed making an announcement Wednesday — though no interest rate change is expected at this time. The week kicks off with a closely watched read on the U.S. service sector: the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for April is due Monday morning. This report tracks activity in industries like retail, health care, and hospitality — which together make up the bulk of the U.S. economy — and can offer key clues about broader momentum, or the lack of it. Earnings slow down from last week’s Big Tech bonanza, but Monday still brings key updates from across sectors. Palantir (PLTR+1.01%) reports after the bell, with analysts expecting EPS double last year’s result, amid continued interest in its AI-driven government and commercial contracts. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX+0.59%) is also due, with EPS forecast slightly down from last year’s. Ford (F-2.22%), expected to post flat earnings, faces scrutiny over its EV roadmap and how it’s handling margin pressure and tariff uncertainty. Tyson Foods (TSN+0.64%) and Clorox (CLX-0.03%) round out the day — both offering windows into consumer behavior as household staples and prices continue to fluctuate. Markets will digest the latest U.S. International Trade Balance report Tuesday morning, offering fresh insight into America’s trade deficit for March. The data comes as tariff rhetoric continues to grab headlines, making this a key release for economists and policy watchers alike. But the biggest event of the week is likely to be the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision. The FOMC meeting begins Tuesday and runs through Wednesday. After last week’s unexpectedly weak GDP print and increased signs of consumer hesitation, markets will be watching closely for any shift in tone. An announcement is expected Wednesday, the second day of the meeting. On the earnings front, Tuesday is a power-packed day across sectors. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+0.47%) also reports, and all eyes will be on its AI chip roadmap as the company looks to keep pace with Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%). Arista Networks (ANET+0.69%) will offer another read on AI infrastructure demand. Insurance and energy dominate elsewhere: Progressive (PGR+0.80%), Duke Energy (DUK-0.58%), Suncor (SU-1.90%), and Marathon Petroleum (MPC-1.53%) all report, giving investors fresh reads on consumer risk, oil supply dynamics, and refining margeins. Ferrari (RACE-1.06%) and Marriot (MAR-1.04%) round out the day with updates that touch on global demand, tariff impacts, and travel spending. Shopify (SHOP-4.98%) kicks off tech results in the morning, with expectations for steady e-commerce growth. In the afternoon, expect Fed news as the FOMC meeting concludes. While no rate change is expected, the policy statement and press conference could offer clues about future cuts or delays. Coinbase (COIN-3.06%) and Cheniere Energy (LNG-3.98%) headline the afternoon, offering insight into crypto trading volume and U.S. LNG exports, respectively. Anheuser-Busch (BUD+0.91%) will provide insights on global beer demand and pricing strategy, while ConocoPhillips (COP-3.65%) provides an update on oil and gas margins amid geopolitical upheavals. Disney (DIS-1.33%) also reports, with analysts looking to streaming profitability and theme park traffic. Uber (UBER+0.83%) is on deck too, aiming to show continued progress on profitability and margin gains. Applovin (APP-6.88%), DoorDash (DASH-0.70%), and Arm Holdings (ARM+1.07%) all report as well, giving another pulse check on digital advertising, food delivery, and semiconductor demand. Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.61%) will provide updates on weight-loss drug momentum. Thursday brings a fresh wave of earnings from across the globe. Enbridge (ENB-0.27%), Canada’s pipeline giant, headlines the morning, with investors watching closely for updates on energy infrastructure demand and regulatory dynamics. Commerzbank’s release will provide a read on the European banking environment amid ongoing rate and currency volatility. On the economic calendar, markets will digest the latest initial jobless claims data, which could reinforce — or challenge — narratives around a softening labor market following the prior week’s weaker-than-expected GDP print. Again Friday, a range of global earnings reports will provide cross-sector, cross-border takeaways. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

China is experiencing severe civil unrest, with tens of thousands of workers protesting in industrial hubs like Shanghai and Inner Mongolia over unpaid wages and mass layoffs, driven by economic turmoil and U.S. tariffs. Trump's escalating tariffs have crippled China's export-dependent economy, causing factory closures, plummeting orders and financial distress for millions of workers, exacerbating existing crises like the property market collapse. The CCP is responding with heavy-handed suppression, deploying riot police and censoring dissent, but protests persist, reflecting growing desperation among workers. U.S. tariffs have accelerated the shift of production out of China to Taiwan, Vietnam and Mexico, further undermining confidence in Beijing's economic management. Beijing has signaled willingness to resume trade negotiations with the U.S. but demands the removal of all tariffs as a precondition.

Beijing has signaled willingness to resume trade negotiations with the U.S. but demands the removal of all tariffs as a precondition. China is facing its worst civil unrest in decades as waves of protests sweep industrial and manufacturing hubs, fueled by economic turmoil exacerbated by U.S. tariffs and a deepening property market collapse. Over the past two weeks, tens of thousands of workers have taken to the streets in cities from Shanghai to Inner Mongolia, demanding unpaid wages and protesting mass layoffs as export-dependent factories buckle under the weight of President Donald Trump's escalating trade war. The latest round of U.S. tariffs has dealt a devastating blow to China's already faltering economy. Export orders have plummeted to levels not seen since the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, forcing factory closures and leaving millions of workers unpaid. (Related: TRADE WAR FALLOUT: Chinese factories slow production as U.S. tariffs bite.) In Tongliao, desperate construction laborers climbed atop unfinished buildings, threatening to jump unless their months of unpaid wages were settled. Near Shanghai, thousands of employees from an LED manufacturing plant blocked highways, demanding back pay dating to January. Similar protests erupted in Dao County after a sporting goods factory abruptly shut down, leaving workers without compensation. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has responded with a heavy-handed crackdown, deploying riot police and censoring online dissent, but the demonstrations show no signs of abating. China weighs U.S. trade negotiations amid calls for "sincerity" Trump, who has made economic confrontation with China a cornerstone of his political platform, has said the impact is intentional. âThey were making from us a trillion dollars a year. They were ripping us off like nobody's ever ripped us off,â he stated in a recent rally. âTheyâre not doing that anymore.â The tariffs, first imposed in 2018 and expanded under his potential second-term agenda, have accelerated a manufacturing exodus from China, with companies relocating to Taiwan, Vietnam and Mexico. The shift has eroded confidence in Beijing's economic stewardship, compounding existing crises, including supply chain breakdowns from Shanghai's draconian COVID lockdowns and a real estate collapse that has left millions of homeowners in financial ruin. As a response to the crisis, China's Ministry of Commerce announced on Friday, May 3, that it is considering renewed tariff negotiations with the United States. "China has noted the repeated statements from senior U.S. officials expressing a willingness to negotiate with China on tariff issues," a ministry spokesperson said. "At the same time, the U.S. side has recently taken the initiative to relay messages to China through relevant channels, expressing a desire to engage in talks. China is currently evaluating this matter." However, Beijing made clear that any negotiations must be accompanied by concrete actions, including the removal of all unilateral tariffs imposed on Chinese goods. "If the U.S. refuses to correct its erroneous unilateral tariff policies, it would only prove its complete lack of sincerity and further undermine mutual trust," the spokesperson said. "Saying one thing while doing another or even using talks as a cover for coercion and extortion â China will not accept this. China's position has been consistent and clear. We will fight to the end if forced to, but our door remains open for talks." Follow Collapse.news for more news related to this.

"At the same time, the U.S. side has recently taken the initiative to relay messages to China through relevant channels, expressing a desire to engage in talks. China is currently evaluating this matter." However, Beijing made clear that any negotiations must be accompanied by concrete actions, including the removal of all unilateral tariffs imposed on Chinese goods. "If the U.S. refuses to correct its erroneous unilateral tariff policies, it would only prove its complete lack of sincerity and further undermine mutual trust," the spokesperson said. "Saying one thing while doing another or even using talks as a cover for coercion and extortion â China will not accept this. China's position has been consistent and clear. We will fight to the end if forced to, but our door remains open for talks." Follow Collapse.news for more news related to this.

Sources include: YourNews.com TimesNowNews.com SCMP.com Brighteon.com As a response to the crisis, China's Ministry of Commerce announced on Friday, May 3, that it is considering renewed tariff negotiations with the United States. "China has noted the repeated statements from senior U.S. officials expressing a willingness to negotiate with China on tariff issues," a ministry spokesperson said. "At the same time, the U.S. side has recently taken the initiative to relay messages to China through relevant channels, expressing a desire to engage in talks. China is currently evaluating this matter." However, Beijing made clear that any negotiations must be accompanied by concrete actions, including the removal of all unilateral tariffs imposed on Chinese goods. "If the U.S. refuses to correct its erroneous unilateral tariff policies, it would only prove its complete lack of sincerity and further undermine mutual trust," the spokesperson said. "Saying one thing while doing another or even using talks as a cover for coercion and extortion â China will not accept this. China's position has been consistent and clear. We will fight to the end if forced to, but our door remains open for talks." Follow Collapse.news for more news related to this.
