The CEO of the largest asset manager in the world says that Bitcoin (BTC) could see drastically higher prices if sovereign wealth funds begin accumulating. Speaking with Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum (WEF) event in Davos, Switzerland, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says that sovereign wealth funds may drive the price of Bitcoin higher as they look to hedge against “local fears” such as inflation and political or economic uncertainty. “If you’re frightened of the debasement of your currency or you’re frightened of the economic or political stability of your country, you can have an internationally based instrument called Bitcoin that will overcome those local fears. And so I’m a big believer in the utilization of that as an instrument, and so if that becomes true and you see that it could be a proper hedge against hope securities or equities, the question is, could you see it be a 2% or 5% allocation? I was with a sovereign wealth fund during this week and that was the conversation. Should we have a 2% allocation? Should we have a 5% allocation? If everybody adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per Bitcoin.” Fink’s BlackRock has embraced Bitcoin over the last year, building a $50 billion stash to back its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) which went live in early 2024. In November, it was found that IBIT had surpassed BlackRock’s gold ETF (IAU) in terms of net assets – reaching over $33 billion – despite the gold ETF launching nearly two decades earlier in 2005. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,607.

Title: Apple vs. Tesla: Which Tech Giant Will Be the Better Investment in 2025?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Investing in stocks can take time and education to get it right and see significant returns. But even the most reliable stocks can go through surprising ups and downs based on a variety of economic factors. If you’re looking at two of the “Magnificent 7” stocks, Tesla and Apple, this year and wondering which is a better investment, that question may not be as straightforward as one over the other. Trending Now: I’m a Self-Made Millionaire — 5 Stocks You Shouldn’t Sell Check Out: 4 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money Stock experts explain what makes each company valuable and offer considerations for when you invest. To understand the value of a stock beyond just its current price on the stock market, investors use a ration known as the P/E ratio, essentially the price-to-earnings ratio, according to Charles Schwab. To get this figure, you divide the price of the stock (P) by the company’s annual per-share earnings (E). So if a stock is trading at around $20 per share, and its earnings are $1, it has a P/E of 20 ($20 divided by $1). Read Next: 13 Cheap Cryptocurrencies With the Highest Potential Upside for You So currently, Tesla’s stock is currently trading at a P/E ratio of over 110, which is extremely high, according to Scott Ritchie, an investing expert at Stoculator. Tesla is a unique company because on the one hand, it’s a car company, but on another it’s also something of a tech company, depending on how you look at it. If you look at it as a car company, it’s an excellent value. Ritchie pointed out that its current market cap is $1.3 trillion, which is at least 20 times the market cap of General Motor and 30 times Ford’s market cap. “In 2024, Tesla produced 1.77 million cars, that makes it a mature car manufacturer in my opinion, and it should be valued as one. Not to mention that the 1.77 million cars is a drop in production from the 2023 1.84 million cars,” Ritchie said. If you look at it as a tech company, due to its heavy investment in AI and robotics, “It is still too soon to bet on it at this valuation especially since most of Tesla’s developments are focused on autonomous driving, which still faces a lot of challenges including regulatory ones that could delay it for at least a couple of years,” Ritchie added. Compared to other tech companies with an over $1 trillion market cap like Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple and Amazon, Tesla still has a higher P/E ratio, but this may be more due to its leadership as a car company. On the other hand, Tesla may be doing well with its cars, but according to David Materazzi, CEO of Galileo FX, an automated trading platform, “[Tesla hasn’t] yet proved that they can dominate the EV market. They don’t have as much money in the bank and it’s still quite a young company.” Apple is often considered a sure thing in stock, because of its dedicated consumer base and wide variety of products. However, Ritchie pointed out that Apple has seen very slow growth lately, both in sales and innovation of new products. “Last year they announced that they cancelled their decade-long electric-car project after spending $10 billion on it over the course of 10 years,” the investing expert said. “Their latest innovative product, the Apple Vision Pro, kicked off with a great debut but seem to have lost the attention soon after.” The canceled car project is likely a good thing, Ritchie said, because it could have been a “distraction” that took Apple away from what it’s good at. Overall, Ritchie added, “Apple could be a better investment than Tesla currently. It is more stable in terms of financial valuation and performance. It has a wider range of products with much less production challenges, that combined with the larger customer base makes a great profit-making formula.” Materazzi is in agreement. While Apple and Tesla are totally different companies they do share similarities. However, he said, “Apple is an extremely successful company with a long history, they have a lot of cash in the bank and their stock is often considered safe, relatively speaking among tech stocks. Apple is already a leader. Tesla is not.” The truth is, you probably can’t go wrong investing in either, or both, Materazzi said. Both stocks are part of the Magnificent 7, the big tech stocks. “Both stocks are frequently purchased by short-term speculators, even if Tesla is the original meme stock and may have a slight advantage in this,” he said. Tesla’s products may have better immediate returns, but “their products are more vulnerable in the marketplace,” Materazzi said. Apple is considered more stable but that also brings lower returns. Ultimately, consult with a financial advisor if you’re trying to decide between the two.

Title: What to know about 'Stargate,' the $500 billion AI infrastructure project touted by Trump

After scrapping the Biden administration’s executive order on artificial intelligence, President Donald Trump announced a half-a-trillion-dollar AI infrastructure plan alongside some of the technology’s top leaders. The president was joined by OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, SoftBank (SFTBY-2.07%) chief executive Masayoshi Son, and Oracle (ORCL+0.42%) chief technology officer Larry Ellison at the White House on Tuesday evening where he announced the Stargate Project, the largest in U.S. history. The new joint venture “intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States,” the AI startup said in a statement. Stargate is starting with an initial $100 billion investment and counts OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and Abu Dhabi-based AI investor MGX as initial equity funders. Here’s what else you need to know about the Stargate Project. The Stargate project is investing in building new data centers and other AI infrastructure in the U.S. The investment “will secure” the U.S.’s AI leadership, provide hundreds of thousands of jobs, “and generate massive economic benefit for the entire world,” according to OpenAI. Stargate will “support the re-industrialization of the United States” and “provide a strategic capability to protect the national security of America and its allies,” the startup added. SoftBank and OpenAI are co-leading the project, with SoftBank taking financial responsibility and OpenAI overseeing operations. Son will be Stargate’s chairman. Elon Musk, a close Trump ally with his own AI startup, responded to the news on X that he has “on good authority” that the Japanese bank “has well under $10B secured.” Altman responded that Musk was “wrong” and invited the billionaire to visit the first site under construction. Along with OpenAI and Oracle, British chip design firm Arm (which SoftBank has a 90% stake in), Nvidia (NVDA-0.61%), and OpenAI’s longstanding partner, Microsoft (MSFT-0.52%), will be “key technology partners” in the project. OpenAI, Oracle, and Nvidia will work together on the project’s first buildout in Texas, OpenAI said, adding that the computing system is a result of a years-long collaboration between it and Nvidia, and a new partnership between it and Oracle. Ellison said Tuesday that the project’s first data centers are already under construction. “Each building is a half a million square feet,” Ellison said. “There are 10 buildings currently being built, but that will expand to 20 and other locations beyond the Abilene location, which is our first location.” The project is still evaluating other potential sites and finalizing definitive agreements. OpenAI said the project builds on its relationship with its largest investor and exclusive compute provider, Microsoft. The startup plans to continue increasing its use of Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing service, it said, alongside the “additional compute” from Stargate. In March, The Information reported that OpenAI and Microsoft were planning a U.S.-based data center that could cost up to $100 billion and house a supercomputer made up of millions of AI chips — also called “Stargate.” However, after it raised a $6.6 billion funding round in October, The Information reported that OpenAI was looking for other data center deals after its chief financial officer Sarah Friar had previously told some shareholders it wasn’t getting enough compute power fast enough from the tech giant. Microsoft said on Tuesday that a new agreement with OpenAI “includes changes to the exclusivity on new capacity” and will follow a model where Microsoft has the right of first refusal. “To further support OpenAI, Microsoft has approved OpenAI’s ability to build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models,” the company said. In an interview with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said the company will continue spending $80 billion building out its cloud computing and that “customers can count on Microsoft with OpenAI models being there everywhere in the world.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Good Grief, Look How Much Wall Street Thinks Netflix Is Worth Now

Netflix had an incredible final quarter of 2024, and today the company — and its investors — are reaping the spoils. Shares in Netflix (NFLX on the NASDAQ) skyrocketed $100 apiece on Tuesday afternoon following the release of the company’s fourth-quarter financials. In a letter to shareholders, Netflix revealed record growth of nearly 19 million subscribers, absolutely blowing away media analysts’ forecasts. Netflix revenue topped $10 billion, though its quarterly profit declined. No matter, there’s a fix for that: Netflix also announced price increases across each of its subscription plans. In turn, Netflix forecast better-than-previously-expected revenue growth for the current quarter, Q1 of 2025. Wall Street loves that stuff. Related Stories ‘The White Lotus’ Renewed for Season 4 by HBO Benedict Cumberbatch: I’m Not a ‘Typical Movie Star’ Sex Symbol Like Brad Pitt or Leonardo DiCaprio How much? We can quantify that. When the stock exchanges opened this morning, NFLX shares nearly hit $1,000 apiece (instead settling for an all-time high of $999). Netflix’s market cap is now north of $400 billion; remember when Blockbuster Video passed on buying the company at $50 million? For some recent perspective on the surge in Netflix’s valuation, in fall 2021, before The Great Netflix Correction, shares appeared to be headed for $700. After reporting a shocking loss in subscribers in the first quarter of 2022, shares of NFLX dropped below $200. It’s been quite the comeback. And media analysts see no ceiling. Well, that’s not entirely correct — it’s more like they just vaulted the ceiling to the roofline. Jessica Reif Ehrlich, a research analyst for Bank of America and a regular interviewer on Netflix’s earnings “call” (Netflix for many years conducted a prerecorded video interview format and not a live call), already saw NFLX at being worth $1,000; now, she’s all the way up to $1,175. Jason Helstein of Oppenheimer raised his own target from $1,040 to $1,150. It’s a popular price target (PT): Tim Nollen from Macquarie is at the same number, up from $965. As is Alicia Reese of Wedbush, now $200 above her prior $950 target; John Hodulik of UBS is also at $1,150, up a whole $10 from his prior PT of $1,140. Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI is up from $950 to $1,100. Barton Crockett of Rosenblatt Securities is either nuts or a prophet — not to be confused with “profit,” which is what you would make if his investment advice comes true — hiking his price target all the way from $680 to $1,494. Somebody wake the boys at Deutsche Bank: Bryan Kraft, Spencer Amer, Benjamin Soff, and Victor-A Odiwuor are at $875 per share. They’re either late to the party or just slow-playing: DB’s prior NFLX PT was $650. With $1,000 clearly in sight, Netflix could be headed for its first stock split in a decade. While none of this (from us) should be considered investment advice, it does have my IndieWire 401k wondering: Where can I find a time machine back to the DVD days?

Investing.com -- Speaking to Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink said he believes Bitcoin could rise to $700,000. Fink said he is a “big believer in the utilization” of Bitcoin as an instrument, explaining that those worried about the debasement of their currencies or the economic or political stability of their countries can have an “internationally based instrument called Bitcoin.” It will “overcome those local fears,” he added. He continued that when speaking with a sovereign wealth fund earlier in the week, the conversation centered on whether they should have a 2% or 5% allocation to Bitcoin. “If everybody adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per Bitcoin,” declared Fink. However, he clarified: “I am not promoting it by the way. That is not my promotion.” In December last year it was reported that BlackRock said in a report it recommends investors consider an allocation of as much as 2% of their portfolio in Bitcoin. “Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and payments system make it a potential diversifier,” said Samara Cohen, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of ETFs and Index Investments at BlackRock. Given its unique value drivers, we see no intrinsic reason why bitcoin should be correlated with major risk assets over the long term,” the BlackRock report stated.

Trump said during a press conference Tuesday that a new company, dubbed the Stargate Project, will invest “at least” $500 billion in AI infrastructure for ChatGPT creator OpenAI over the next four years, such as data centers being built in the heart of Texas. Private-sector companies like OpenAI, Oracle, and the Japanese conglomerate Softbank are among Stargate’s initial equity investors, according to a joint press release. The company has also chosen Microsoft and Nvidia as technology partners. “This infrastructure will secure American leadership in AI, create hundreds of thousands of American jobs, and generate massive economic benefit[s] for the entire world,” Stargate said. To be clear, Tuesday’s announcement did not specifically mention the World project, formerly known as Worldcoin (the WLD token still bears that name). Launched by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in 2023, the eyeball-scanning project is constructing a digital identification platform that leverages biometric data and cryptography. Still, Worldcoin’s market cap jumped past $2.2 billion Wednesday, with AI-related projects also catching a bid from traders. Among the biggest gainers was Virtuals, a protocol for tokenized AI agents that saw its VIRTUAL token increase 20% in price to $3.06. AI agents will change the internet as we know it. Bring on the future 🫡 — World (@worldcoin) January 22, 2025 Though some traders believe that AI will fuel the next crypto revolution, the so-called “meta” built around AI agents and their associated meme coins appeared imperiled just recently, as the president’s newly launched meme coin took center stage and drained liquidity from other coins. But a crypto-friendly administration that’s also cheerleading investments in AI has traders excited as AI agents show signs of taking off, Bitwise Senior Investment Strategist Juan Leon told Decrypt. “The $500 billion could translate into investments that supercharge crypto and AI synergies, helping America become the dominant leader in these two critical technologies,” he said. The crypto trading firm Wintermute described Trump’s announcement Tuesday as “surprising,” pushing traders toward AI-related coins, such as Aixbt (AIXBT) and the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET), which encompasses Fetch.ai’s decentralized machine learning network. The excitement surrounding AI wasn’t limited to the cryptosphere, with Nvidia’s stock price rising 3.6% on the day to $146. Oracle’s stock was meanwhile up 6% Wednesday to $183.

Title: ByteDance director confident TikTok deal will get done, sees options to avoid an outright sale

A major shareholder of ByteDance, the Beijing-based owner of TikTok, said Wednesday he was confident that a deal will be reached to ensure the video-sharing app stays online in the US — and suggested there may be options “short of divestiture” on the table. TikTok received a lifeline this week from President Trump, who issued an executive order delaying enforcement of a national ban by 75 days while China-based ByteDance seeks an American buyer. The app remains online after a brief shutdown last weekend. Bill Ford, CEO of ByteDance shareholder General Atlantic, who also sits on the TikTok parent’s board of directors, said “it’s in everybody’s interest” to hammer out an agreement following Trump’s order. “We’ll get on with it, as soon as maybe the end of the week in terms of negotiating what might work,” Ford told Axios during an event at the annual World Economic Summit in Davos, Switzerland. “The Chinese government, the US government and the company and the board all have to be involved in this conversation.” Ford also said there might be terms “short of divestiture” that would satisfy US authorities, but did not elaborate. He also placed blame on the Biden administration for not “engaging with us on a real dialogue” before the Jan. 19 divestiture deadline. The Chinese government, which long vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok, changed its tune this week and signaled the company should be allowed to explore a potential deal. General Atlantic and Blackrock are among multiple institutional investors that collectively own a 60% chunk of ByteDance. The company says its executives and employees each own 20%. Trump has vowed to “save TikTok” and said he wants the US to receive a 50% ownership stake in the app as part of a joint venture, though the exact details of his plan remain vague. On Tuesday, Trump said he would be open to his close adviser Elon Musk, who already owns the social media platform X, making a bid to buy TikTok. Trump also invited Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison, whose company is a cloud computing partner for TikTok, to get involved. Other potential buyers include a joint bid floated by billionaire Frank McCourt and “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary, who have said they have $20 billion in commitments as part of a plan to buy the TikTok brand and rebuild its algorithm from scratch on US soil. Another group that includes YouTube star Jimmy “Mr. Beast” Donaldson and Employer.com CEO Jesse Tinsley is also looking to buy TikTok. Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said he is interested in investing in TikTok but said he had paused any bid to buy the app outright, while ex-Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick also was said to be exploring an acquisition in recent months. Any buyer would face an uphill battle to meet the criteria of the bipartisan-pushed law, which requires China to divest ownership of TikTok due to concerns about US national security. China hawks, including Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), have said any link to the Chinese Communist Party would need to be entirely eliminated. US lawmakers and the federal government say TikTok is effectively a spying and propaganda tool capable of mass data collection and influencing public opinion through its algorithm. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the law two days before the deadline, rejecting ByteDance’s argument that it violated the First Amendment. As The Post reported, TikTok remains unavailable in app stores operated by major tech firms Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon. Under the divestiture law, US companies that facilitate access to TikTok face fines of $5,000 per user. That would amount to as much as $850 billion, given TikTok’s American user base of 170 million.

There are gay, lesbian, and transgender children ..Bishop Budde, if LGBTQ people are afraid, it is largely because of the rhetoric that anyone opposed to transgenderism is a proponent of "genocide." You may have missed it, but a fair number of gays and lesbians oppose the transgender movement because of its sexualization of children.

Title: Intel races to find its next CEO, but insiders say no clear frontrunners yet

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel (INTC) is racing against the clock to find a new chief executive who can launch the company into the artificial intelligence age — or risk sinking into irrelevance. A series of strategic missteps dating back to the early 2000s and a failure to build cutting-edge technologies culminated in the once-dominant chipmaker’s dramatic crash in 2024, when its stock plummeted 55%. Its board ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger in December and appointed two temporary co-CEOs. The move laid bare the board’s lack of a coherent strategy and called into question the fate of Gelsinger's bold turnaround plan: Opening up Intel’s manufacturing business to make chips for external customers (that is, operating a foundry). “I think it's the board that should have been fired, not him,” analyst William Lazonick, who has written extensively on Intel for the Institute of New Economic Thinking, told Yahoo Finance. Since Gelsinger’s exit, the board has brought on two semiconductor experts, former ASML (ASML) CEO Eric Meurice and Microchip (MCHP) chairman Steve Sanghi. Prior to their addition, only two of the 11 board members had semiconductor industry experience, per Citi analyst Christopher Danley. A Wall Street Intel analyst said Meurice and Sanghi are "already ... challenging the plans [and] the processes within Intel." They asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the topic. Intel declined to comment on its CEO search. Yahoo Finance spoke to analysts and several former high-level Intel executives, who offered their insights on who Intel’s board might select to take the helm of America’s only large-scale, leading-edge chip manufacturer. The aforementioned Intel analyst told Yahoo Finance that temporary co-CEO David Zinsner “doesn't want the job.” Several people with knowledge of the situation said Zinsner’s counterpart, Michelle Johnston Holthaus, is being considered for the role. A former executive said the Intel veteran, who heads its products group, "has a shot." The former executive and another former high-level executive from Intel's manufacturing division critiqued Holthaus as lacking technical skill — a quality that analysts and Intel insiders agree is a must-have in its next leader. “She never has an independent idea. She never drives an agenda,” one of the former executives said. Intel describes Holthaus as “a proven general manager and leader.” Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Anshel Sag said the chipmaker will likely choose someone currently outside the company, but the decision will take a while. “As someone who's very tightly connected within the company, I have not gotten the feeling that they are even remotely close to picking someone,” Sag told Yahoo Finance. Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported that Intel’s external candidates include former Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) CEO Lip-Bu Tan, Marvell Technology (MRVL) CEO Matt Murphy, Intel board member Stacy Smith, Ampere Computing founder Renee James, Apple's (AAPL) internal chip head Johny Srouji, Analog Devices (ADI) exec Gregory Bryant, and Lenovo’s (0992.HK) Kirk Skaugen. Five of those “outsiders” previously worked at Intel. Several of them spent more than a decade at the company and were pushed out under former CEO Brian Krzanich. The Intel analyst also mentioned Boeing (BA) chair and former Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Steve Mollenkopf and Eclipse Ventures general partner Sanjay Jha as potential candidates. Sources have mixed opinions on whether Intel should hire an insider who knows the company well. "Intel needs to be examined by a fresh set of eyes unburdened by prior affiliations," Futurum Group analyst David Nicholson told Yahoo Finance. Bernstein semiconductor analyst Stacy Rasgon said Lip-Bu Tan is the candidate “a lot of shareholders would love to see” fill the role. Tan previously served on Intel’s board but stepped down in August because he disagreed with Intel’s foundry strategy — a plan that was aggressively pursued by Gelsinger. Former executives agreed that Tan is “well-respected” and, in many ways, an ideal person for the role. “Lip-Bu knows how to do a turnaround, how to reinvent a business, how to incentivize change. He also knows how resistant Intel is to change,” the aforementioned Intel manufacturing executive told Yahoo Finance. Yet according to analysts, Tan would not be interested in such a leadership role at this point in his career. Tan also sits on the board of Gelsinger's Christian organization. One of the former high level executives with knowledge of the matter said that Tan is still deciding whether he would consider taking the role. One of the five former Intel insiders reportedly under consideration for the CEO role is AI startup Ampere founder Renee James, who was described by two of the former executives as “strategically brilliant” and “execution-oriented.” However, one of the sources, who worked at the company for decades, said that James does not have a good enough relationship with the board to be a top pick. Stacy Smith — an Intel board member who previously worked at the company for nearly 30 years, including as CFO for roughly a decade — was described by the former Intel manufacturing executive as “trusted, respected, well-liked.” Smith recently oversaw the IPO of Japanese company Toshiba’s chip business — which was rebranded as Kioxia — as its executive chair. The completion of Kioxia’s IPO opens the door for Smith to take the Intel job, one of the former executives said. Former executives also spoke highly of Kirk Skaugen, a former engineer who served in executive roles across Intel’s PC and data center business. Apple's Srouji and Marvell's Murphy are both well-versed in semiconductors, but sources doubt either will take the top job. Intel hired executive search firm Spencer Stuart to help with the search, Bloomberg reported. Wall Street has mixed views on how long the CEO search will take. In a client note on Jan. 8, Danley suggested that the process could wrap up “within the next couple of months,” writing that “the company is relatively far along in the process.” Meanwhile, KeyBanc’s John Vinh wrote in his own note the same day that the process would likely take four to six months. “The board is currently looking at external candidates with no hard timelines,” Vinh said. Last Friday, Intel’s stock popped on a report that an unnamed company is trying to acquire the company. Analyst Dylan Patel suggested Elon Musk, while Citi wrote that Broadcom (AVGO) would be the most likely buyer. Last year, Qualcomm reportedly explored an acquisition, but its interest in such a deal cooled. Intel did not respond to a request for comment on the acquisition rumors. Meanwhile, US officials are eyeing a merger between US-based chip manufacturer GlobalFoundries and Intel, per Bloomberg. But until a new CEO can be found, the chipmaking giant is at a standstill. “The interim CEOs … will avoid altering the overall grand strategy in irreversible ways,” KeyBanc analyst Vinh added in his note.

Title: Trump Signs RTO Order—What’s Happening To Remote Jobs In 2025?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwells/2025/01/22/trump-signs-rto-order-whats-happening-to-remote-jobs-in-2025/

Everytime you receive news that your job is on the line or you’re forced to leave your role due to ... [+] remote work policies, use it as an opportunity to try something new and reinvent yourself "We're moving in a new direction." "We're undergoing a restructure." "This is our year of efficiency." "We're headed in a different place right now." "The company is undergoing downsizing to reduce waste." How many times have you received a notice or email that included any of these lines? The anxiety creeps and your heart starts pounding because you already know what follows...you're fired. Or at least, you're on the chopping block and can expect your role to be eliminated at any moment. We've barely completed the first quarter of 2025, and already the workplace is experiencing major upheavals. BP is cutting 5% of its workforce as part of its "simplify and focus" plan, and joins companies like Meta and Bridgewater Associates, who announced plans to cut 5% and 7% of their headcount respectively. And to add to 2025's unfolding workplace drama, newly appointed President Trump signed an executive order Tuesday forcing all federal workers to cease working remotely, or they will be fired, with some exemptions being permissible. This news comes on the heels of Amazon's five-days-a-week RTO policy implementation as of January 1, according to Business Insider. Trump's executive order could potentially impact 1.1 million federal employees who are eligible to work remotely (out of the 2.28 million government workers)—228,000 of them who are already fully remote, based on figures from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)'s report to Congress in August 2024. The goal? To ultimately shrink the federal workforce in line with the goals of the newly-created government thinktank and temporary Department of Government Efficiency, nicknamed DOGE, which is focused on slashing costs and expenditure of resources across government agencies by 2026. In fact, tech mogul Elon Musk who heads the operation, stated in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed alongside Vivek Ramaswamy that "requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome," referring to the loophole in statutory civil-service protections that allows “reductions in force” that don’t target specific employees. "If federal employees don’t want to show up, American taxpayers shouldn’t pay them for the Covid-era privilege of staying home," he said. The intent behind forcing eligible federal workers and current fully-remote government employees to work remotely five days a week comes as no surprise. Other major companies such as Amazon have been suspected of quiet firing in an effort to drive efficiency (quiet firing is the practice of creating hostile, demotivating, or other negative conditions at work that create a condition where employees voluntarily hand in their resignations, which reduces the need to go through the process and consultations associated with firing). A recent ResumeTemplates survey of 1,000 U.S. managers found that "45% of companies anticipate layoffs in 2025, with many citing economic concerns, AI automation, and the incoming Trump administration’s policies as influencing factors." Additionally, a recent Pew Research Center survey noted that nearly half (46%) of remote workers say they would readily leave their job if no longer permitted to work from home. Although of course, labor unions and others are using their rights to sue and push back against anti-remote work policies such as those advocated and enforced by Trump and his allies, the fact remains that incidents like these create hostility towards professionals who already work from home, and a culture of remote work being taboo. If you're a federal employee (or work at a company that's in the process of enforcing RTO mandates) and you work from home in a hybrid arrangement, or are 100% remote, here are a few steps you should take now so you can continue to work remotely and feel supported in your goals: Whenever quiet firing occurs, prioritize taking care of your mental health First, it's OK to feel enraged, slighted, and hurt after providing years of service to the same employer and consistently being a high performer, especially if you're a public servant. It's natural to feel shock and anxiety during moments like these. This is why it's critical now, more than ever before, to take care of your mental wellbeing and take time to breathe, and acknowledge and express your feelings. Find or create a support network. Take up a new hobby. Throw yourself into something healthy that will distract you from your current employment situation. Understand that it's fine to not have everything together in your life, and what you're feeling is likely what thousands of other workers are feeling right now. Whenever you hear about a "restructuring" or "flattening structures" within the workforce of your company, consider it a time for change—not just for them, but for you. If they can head in a new direction, so can you. It's time to shift your perspective and, although it's easier said than done, view it positively, because this is your chance to rediscover yourself. After all, you are the architect of your future. No one, not even an employer that you've held a decades-long commitment to, has the right or power to control your life and whether or not you achieve your career and financial goals. Sometimes, major negative events occur in our lives so that we can rethink the meaning of our existence. It gives us time to pause and reflect about whether we want to continue working in the same role, or whether it's time to try something new. Your challenge is to use this as an opportunity to reinvent yourself and try something new. Take time for your hobbies and try online personality tests and quizzes to understand your core values and passions. This can help you shift your focus from seeing your current employment situation as a negative thing, to actually viewing it as a catalyst for positive change in your life. This is because often, you won't progress in your career and fulfil your potential until you're uncomfortable with your work environment. Discomfort creates change. Next, it's time to dust off your resume and LinkedIn profile and update them. In fact, go ahead and give them a total overhaul. If you're serious about finding remote work, you need to be proactive about displaying the right skills in your resume—especially skills that are in high demand for most remote jobs, like roles in marketing, project management, and AI. Although you can use traditional sites like Indeed, Monster, and ZipRecruiter to find remote jobs, it's much easier to locate them through job boards that specialize in remote and flexible work such as FlexJobs, We Work Remotely, and Remote.co. Additionally, the start-up incubator Y Combinator has a job board on its website that is constantly being updated for remote jobs at start-ups. And of course, don't forget to reach out to your network and strategically build new connections. Freelancing is a viable and increasingly popular alternative to traditional employment. There are expected to be more than 86 million freelancers (half the U.S. workforce) by 2027, so why not use your skills to join them and make money? As a freelancer, you have more control over your hours and location of employment, so this is highly favorable for remote work, and you can start building your freelance business immediately. The success of your freelance business is in proportion to your expertise, marketing, and research, and will grow as fast as the hours and effort you put in. Freelancing is one of the easiest ways to find a remote job straight away Remote work and hybrid working isn't over in 2025. By following the advice in this article, you can continue to prioritize your wellbeing, spend time with loved ones, make more money, and cut the headache and costs of commuting as you embrace this new way to work.

Title: Building The Business Case For Growth Investment
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephendiorio/2025/01/22/building-the-business-case-for-growth-investment/
Time Published: 2025-01-22T16:08:19Z

A Better Formula For Funding and Executing Commercial Transformation Kristen Carloni leads the global Business Proposal Strategy team for Aladdin Sales and Marketing, a B2B technology business within BlackRock. Her responsibilities center around ensuring an impactful and scalable business proposal process for selling the firm’s financial technology products. From that perch, her team directly impacts the majority of revenues in the business. “The most important, biggest deals come through my team,” says Carloni. “So as a baseline if we don’t do our job the firm is never going to see that revenue, it’s just going to die on the vine.” While Business Proposal Strategy conveys the workings of her job, Kristen’s role defies conventional description. In practice she works across marketing, product, IT and sales functions to leverage technology and AI in ways that help her firm drive faster, more profitable and scalable growth. In other words, she’s a poster child for what is emerging as the next generation of growth leader, a Revenue Operations executive. The description is apt because Kristen is working across silos to better connect teams, data, technology and processes to: 1. Generate more consistent, reliable and profitable revenue growth 2. Improve the return on growth investments in sales, marketing and customer programs 3. Maximize the return on commercial assets like brand, channels, innovation and knowledge assets She’s doing this with a small team of under a dozen people who are impacting over 90 percent of the revenues in the business. At the same time she’s helping the people responsible for the rest of the revenue be more effective in their jobs. And she's in the best position, most importantly, to leverage AI multiplier to drive more scalable revenue growth. A big reason she is so effective is she has adopted the principles and platforms of Strategic Response Management (SRM) which is defined as the people, practice and technology to unlock organizational knowledge for profit growth. Every sales operations, marketing operations, or sales enablement executive can learn a lot from Kristen about creating, quantifying, and communicating the financial impact commercial transformation can have on the business. Why? Because she’s used the principles of Revenue Operations to effectively unlock more of the full potential of the growth investments and assets of her business. And she’s done it from what seems on the surface as a relatively back office “cost center” stuck in the middle of the revenue cycle - the bid and proposal response team. A BETTER BUSINESS CASE FOR COMMERCIAL TRANSFORMATION Generating more consistent and profitable revenue - Unlike typical sales and marketing operations teams, Kristen’s team has the advantage of directly impacting top line revenues. That makes a big difference when it comes to leading commercial transformation in the eyes of leadership. The average B2B response team directly impacts almost one half (48%) of revenues in terms of both customer acquisition (via RFPs) and loyalty and expansion (via Due Diligence Questionnaires) according to APMP benchmarks. They also drive additional revenue by providing market intelligence, self-service knowledgebases, customer insight, and knowledge assets that help improve the overall go-to-market process. As evidence, Carloni’s team has leveraged technology to grow the percent of revenues they directly impact from 70% to 92% of revenues in the past year – with greater productivity, performance and at lower cost. They’ve effectively used the insights and experience drawn from responding to hundreds of customers to inform and improve the efforts of the product, marketing, finance, and sales teams in many ways. Calculating the Probability of winning. Showing where to allocate resources. Identifying the top features customers want. Forecasting future demand 24 months out. Reporting which marketing messages are landing or not. And more. Here are some examples: Improving the return on growth investment. As compelling as these returns are, many sales leaders make the mistake of treating sales productivity as a single solution problem, according to Bob Kelly, the CEO of the Sales Management Association. Instead Kelly advises managers to treat commercial transformation as an equilibrium problem that involves constantly balancing some fundamental tradeoffs such as investing in salesperson up-skilling versus simplifying the selling job; undergoing wholesale transformation versus pursuing incremental process improvements. Kristen Carloni has struck that balance in her efforts to transform the commercial model one dollar at a time at Blackrock. “Our ability to impact sales win rates, productivity, capacity and costs is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the financial impact we’ve delivered when you compare it to the multiplier effect it has had on the return we are getting from our selling assets, IP, and investments,” says Carloni. Academic research reinforces Carloni’s focus on maximizing the return on commercial investments at lower risk. Business leaders that understand the math of growth in a modern business realize that far greater financial impact can be had by managing the allocation and deployment of growth resources, investments and assets such as building customer and brand equity, while mitigating the risks associated with selling. Maximizing the return on commercial assets. Perhaps the biggest financial impact a commercial transformation leader like Carloni can have is to unlock the enormous untapped growth potential of the firms commercial assets. Why? Because the majority of the value in firms is intangible commercial assets – including market-based assets, knowledge assets, computerized information, innovative property, and economic competencies like ‘sales know how.’ When properly measured and accounted for, these intangible assets can represent up to 80% or more of the value of a business.

Title: People are buying the wrong stock thinking it's part of OpenAI's Stargate Project
URL: https://qz.com/stargate-mgx-stock-openai-softbank-trump-musk-oracle-1851744836
Time Published: 2025-01-22T16:00:00Z
Full Content:
MGX stock is soaring Wednesday on the heels of the company’s involvement with OpenAI and SoftBank’s (SFTBY-2.07%) new Stargate project. There’s just one minor problem — it’s the stock ticker for the wrong MGX. MGX represents shares of Metagenomi Inc., a biotechnology company focused on leveraging genome editing tools. Last week, the company said it is working on bringing its experimental treatment for hemophilia A to clinical trials in 2026. Investors were likely confused by a press release announcing that MGX would be among the initial equity funders in the Stargate Project, which seeks to invest $500 billion over the next four years in new artificial intelligence infrastructure for OpenAI. The MGX referenced there is a technology fund based in the United Arab Emirates. The likely misunderstanding propelled Metagenomi stock up by as much as 33% on Wednesday before gains were pared back down to a 25% increase. Shares are down 67% for the last 12 months and 24% over the last six months. As for Stargate, the project is expected to be a major boost to the U.S. economy and OpenAI, according to the people backing it. President Donald Trump, who was joined by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son, and Oracle’s (ORCL+0.42%) Larry Ellison at the White House — said it would generate more than 100,000 jobs. The group’s first project, a one-million-square-foot data project, is already underway in Texas. Although the backers plan to eventually spend $500 billion, the companies said they would deploy $100 billion “immediately.” Stargate will be chaired by Son, whose SoftBank will have financial responsibility for the company, while OpenAI handles the operations. Those companies, along with Oracle and MGX, are the initial equity backers. SoftBank-backed Arm, Microsoft (MSFT-0.52%), and Nvidia (NVDA-0.61%) will work with Oracle and OpenAI on the technology. However, not everyone is fully on board with Stargate. Atreides Management Chief Investment Office Gavin Baker, who also noted the MGX mix-up, called the $500 billion “a ridiculous number” that “no one should take seriously” unless SoftBank sold their Arm and Alibaba (BABA-0.71%) stock. “And I say all of this as someone who is really optimistic about AI in every way,” Baker added in a post on X. “Stargate is fiction wrapped around a much less impressive reality.” Tesla (TSLA-0.82%) CEO Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump’s with his own federal task force, agrees. In a series of posts late on Tuesday and early on Wednesday morning, Musk said he has it on “good authority” that SoftBank has less than $10 billion secured. “They don’t actually have the money,” Musk wrote on X, replying to an OpenAI post announcing Stargate. Musk, an OpenAI co-founder who left the startup and has a longstanding feud with Altman and the startup, also has his own AI company, xAI. His firm raised $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation. That cash is expected to help xAI expand its Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, which it developed with Nvidia chips.

Title: 'Elon and I hugged it out': Jamie Dimon says Elon Musk is 'our Einstein'

JPMorgan Chase (JPM+0.79%) CEO Jamie Dimon thinks Elon Musk is a modern-day Albert Einstein. “The guy is our Einstein,” Dimon said of Musk, the Tesla (TSLA-0.82%) and SpaceX CEO who has become a top ally to President Donald Trump. “I’d like to be helpful to him and his companies as much as we can.” Musk, the world’s richest person, now wields considerable power in the White House, after helping Trump secure a second term. Musk is tasked with heading the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which was initially pitched as a means of finding as much as $2 trillion in federal spending cuts, but which appears to have shifted its focus to updating software and reducing headcount. Dimon, in an interview with CNBC (CMCSA+0.23%) at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said that he recently mended fences with Musk after JPMorgan dropped its $162 million lawsuit against the electric vehicle maker. “Elon and I hugged it out,” Dimon said. “He came to one of our conferences. He and I had a nice, long chat. We settled some of our differences.” In a suit filed against Tesla in 2021, JPMorgan alleged that the company breached a 2014 stock warrant deal after the bank lowered the exercise price. Under the contract, if Tesla stock traded above a certain price, it would owe JPMorgan money in either shares or cash. JPMorgan claimed the stock warrants became more valuable following a 2018 tweet by Musk in which he said he was considering taking the company private at a share price of $420, and that “funding [was] secured.” The post caused Tesla’s price to surge, before dipping weeks later after he said he wouldn’t follow through with the idea. The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Musk with securities fraud in September 2018 over the tweets. Musk and Tesla each paid $20 million in civil fines to settle the charges. Tesla countersued in 2023, alleging that JPMorgan took advantage of the tweet to reduce the strike price of millions of warrants in an attempt to catch a windfall from the deal. JPMorgan dropped the lawsuit without prejudice last November. At the time, a JPMorgan spokesperson said that the two firms “have decided to enter into a new commercial relationship and settle the outstanding disputes between the companies.” “This is a good outcome for all and we look forward to working together,” the spokesperson said.

January 22, 2025 09:05 ET | Source: Unlimited Unlimited NEW YORK, Jan. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Unlimited, an asset management firm and ETF sponsor that uses proprietary technology to provide low-cost, alternative strategies to a variety of investors, today published its Q4 2024 Hedge Fund Barometer, showing that heading into 2025 hedge fund managers are positioned conservatively while waiting on market uncertainty to play out. According to the Barometer, the industry’s low conviction levels could be underpinned by reluctance to chase the run-up in assets observed in 2024 or make aggressive bets on weakening assets. Overall, the hedge fund industry posted a modestly positive performance in the fourth quarter of 2024, with overall gross returns of 0.9%, according to Unlimited’s proprietary technology. Event Driven strategies led the quarter with an impressive 2.8% gross return, while Emerging Markets strategies struggled, declining by -2.1% gross. Hedge fund performance in 4Q24 was bolstered by strategic positioning around key global events. Event Driven and Global Macro managers benefited from investments aligned with expectations surrounding Donald Trump’s re-election in November. In contrast, Emerging Markets managers faced headwinds due to the absence of anticipated Chinese economic stimulus, contributing to the underperformance of the strategy. Caution Amidst Euphoria Heading into 2025 Looking ahead, hedge fund managers are displaying caution as they approach 2025. Thematically, the Industry seems to be in “wait-and-see” mode, with managers largely maintaining exposure levels near long-term averages across major asset classes. 2024 Performance Recap Despite a modest fourth quarter, the hedge fund industry closed 2024 with an estimated 12% gross return (~8% net of fees). Equity strategies stood out, with both Long/Short and Event Driven funds outperforming industry averages. Managed Futures lagged, delivering returns below cash after fees. While industry returns in 2024 exceeded the long-term average by 300-400 basis points, they fell short of the extraordinary performance seen in equity markets during the same period.Key Industry Insights: Positioning Outlook As hedge funds enter 2025, managers appear to be holding firepower awaiting clearer market and economic signals. With risk-taking at multi-year lows, the industry appears poised for a cautious but flexible approach to emerging opportunities. Click here to view a video on how Unlimited’s technology works.

Title: The State of Isekai Anime

If you wanted to characterize “the biggest trends in anime of the last decade,” you might be inclined to narrow in on anime's increasingly global presence or the exploding volume of new TV anime being produced. Maybe, if you follow the industry closely, you'd talk about how overseas finance has changed what anime gets made, a preference towards single cour releases, the decline of original anime not based on a pre-existing manga or novel, or the implications of home video collapsing as a pillar of anime monetization. But one trend that has been impossible to ignore, even amongst people who don't regularly watch anime, the rise of isekai. If you're entrenched in the anime fandom, it probably feels as though isekai has had a lock on the anime industry for a generation. While there have been anime that would qualify with some regularity going back to the '80s, the term only garnered widespread use in the last fifteen years, and its adoption into English-language fan spaces is even more recent. It was only last year that the loanword joined the Oxford English Dictionary, a full 14 years after “kawaii” and eight behind fellow genre-most-associated-with-anime, “mecha”. The English-language Wikipedia page on isekai is hardly older than Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Indeed, 2019 was the first year where more than 10 isekai series aired on Japanese airwaves. That would be but an auspicious allusion to what was to come. We are at peak isekai: the genre makes up 15% of 2024's new TV anime. The 34 isekai released last year may only represent a marginal 3% increase from the one prior, but over the last five, the volume of new titles with characters whisked away to another world has grown 143%. To highlight how profound that growth is: more than half of all isekai in the medium's history have been released since 2020. The most important takeaway is not necessarily the genre's dramatic increase in production, but how isekai seems to have leveled off, holding steady at around 15% of new anime produced. Viewership behavior suggests we have not hit our point of diminishing returns with the genre and that the demand side could bear even more isekai than we're getting now. The community consensus seems to be that there's already too much isekai being made, but when we discuss viewership data later, we'll explore how fan behavior doesn't reflect that notion. One may be tempted to look at this chart and see the timing of isekai's boom as correlative with the COVID-19 pandemic, to assume that part of the genre's growth is tied to increased demand for fantasy and comfort food during a time when many were isolated or locked down. While it conceptually makes sense, I'd be skeptical of the importance of lockdowns for two reasons. First, this chart largely captures the supply side of the isekai game. Anime production is a slow process, and typically takes a few years between a production committee assembling and any actual production taking place. Second, while the international anime community saw its ranks multiply during this period, isekai did not experience disproportionate growth. If anything, I'd be surprised to see fewer fans of the genre proportionately, even if the raw number of card-carrying isekai lifers has blossomed. It's true that international sales now represent a majority of revenue in the anime industry, but production plans for this quantity of isekai were already penciled in before that was the case. As for the chart methodology, what qualifies as “another world” or not depends on who you ask. For our purposes, an isekai anime is either 1) anime that has been categorized as isekai by their publishers, 2) anime that explicitly uses phrases like “isekai” or “in another world” as part of their titles and synopses, or 3) anime I judged as clear “reverse isekai” stories, where a character from another world is trapped in the real world, such as The Devil Is a Part-Timer! or Otaku Elf. I'm very much evaluating whether or not an anime embodies the spirit of isekai in the popular imagination but even if one accounts for any quibbles in definitions here, the direction laid out by the analysis holds strong. A final observation about the chart is that isekai's growth is similar to John Green's notion about falling asleep and/or falling in love: it happens slowly and then all at once. The genre's dominance was a long time coming, and one only has to look at the history of the genre in anime to see how. While much can be said about isekai in Japan, today we'll be examining the state of isekai from a primarily Western perspective, with a focus on English-speaking territories. In Japanese, isekai more literally reads as “different world” or “another world”, but the implication and common use in English is as a subgenre where the protagonist finds themselves in another world, typically one more fantastical than their own. While this concept is found in folklore from around the world, the genre's roots in popular fiction like Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court lay a common groundwork for how isekai is approached today. While there are still some Western works of fiction that would reasonably be considered isekai, over the last 30 years, isekai has become a staple of anime, manga, and novels from Japan. Until recently, almost all of its growth has come from the popularity of media from that country. The mastermind behind Mobile Suit Gundam, Yoshiyuki Tomino, released the great Aura Battler Dunbine in 1983. It's considered the first isekai anime by many due to its commonalities with the genre today, despite a handful of contenders for that designation with earlier release dates, including an anime adaptation of the Wizard of Oz that hit cinemas the year prior. The 49 (thoroughly excellent) episodes of Dunbine locked in many of the tropes that would become most commonly associated with isekai going forward and served as an inspiration for many of its successors in the genre. Popular anime like The Vision of Escaflowne, Magic Knight Rayearth, Digimon, and .hack//SIGN are all clear examples of “in another world” stories released in the years between Aura Battler Dunbine and the modern era of isekai. While they may have been described with the term in Japan and occasionally compared to one another, the term was not used as a category until the Japanese web novel platform Shōsetsuka ni Narō grew an audience in the late 00s in parallel with one of its more popular subjects for fanfiction, The Familiar of Zero. The excellent Kim Morrissy covered this topic quite comprehensively for ANN a few years back if you'd like to dig into the history more. It wasn't until 2012 with Sword Art Online that English-speaking netizens began using the phrase. According to SAO author Reki Kawahara in comments on Twitter (formally known as X), this is a misuse of the term, saying “SAO is set in the real world!” Sword Art Online became one of the first mega-hits of the streaming era. Accurate or not, this association immediately provided awareness to many overseas fans. To give something a name gives it power, and as is often the case with international anime audiences, having a Japanese name for the category elevated the allure even further, and made those “in the know” feel like insiders. Equipped with “isekai,” fans worldwide began to recognize the genre's relevance with ever-increasing aptitude, perhaps disproportionately so considering how rare isekai anime were during this period. And so isekai grew. Comparing the two above charts—the Google Trends journey of the word “isekai” and the release cadence of new isekai anime—reveals the impact of popular series like Overlord, Re:Zero, and KONOSUBA in the mid-2010s: there wasn't enough supply to meet demand suggested by the interest by 2017-2018. Anime most frequently takes 3-4 years between greenlight and release. It's as though you can see dozens of producers scrambling in parallel to get their company's response to Re:Zero onto the desks of animators with the way the charts dance up and to the right. Is isekai the most popular genre of anime? In a word, yes. For illustration, I've put together some analysis of all TV anime that broadcast in Japan in 2024. Popularity was determined by the same formula employed in the series of articles where I compare what's being watched in the U.S. compared to Japan expanded to also include several other countries where English is the most-spoken language: Canada, The United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. By using data scraped from a dozen pirate sites, estimates for legal sites from all available data, and other proxies for viewership, after weighing each metric based on geographic distributions and a quality rating (based on Nate Silver's “pollster ratings” to prioritize metrics that have been demonstrably predictive of viewership in the past), you can make a fairly robust relative popularity scale. For the year 2024, the “top anime” of the year was a competitively ranked trio: Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Hashira Training Arc, Solo Leveling, and DAN DA DAN. All other titles were rated out of 100 compared to the “big three,” if you will. If you then average out the ratings per genre, you get the following chart: What you see here is that isekai is number two…but only slightly, despite the action genre being home to all ten of the most-performant anime of 2024. While most anime fall into multiple genres in this analysis, “isekai” is wholly unrepresented in the top ten anime of the year, first showing up at the #11 spot. So, how is isekai so close to action in the ratings? Action is one of the biggest cohorts in our analysis, including nearly half of the year's TV series within its large tent. As such, it's reasonable to assume plenty of lower-quality action series dragging down the average, and you'd be right to. However, the biggest determinant of isekai's success is its consistency. I could make a lot of sports analogies for isekai here, but I'm going to do it in a way that makes sense to me: through the film Moneyball. It's based on the somewhat true story of a baseball general manager who employs quantitative analysis to transform the sport into a giant optimization problem, allowing the (then) Oakland-based Athletics to hire a roster of players who drastically overperform relative to their price and move up in the league's standings. While it's overly simplified for the movie (and arguably, overstated), the key metric the A's team seeks is a player's ability to first base. The heart of the concept is that if you can just get more players on-base, on average, you'll end up with more runs than a team with a lower on-base percentage. And that's what isekai does; it gets on-base. When we analyze anime ratings, we split them into four equal groups called quartiles. The light blue bar shows the middle two quartiles, representing the popularity of the median 50% of each genre. Looking at these ranges, isekai is far ahead, with the highest first and third quartile. Even the comparatively weak isekai—those at the 25th percentile—are comparable to the average performance from nearly every other genre. This is also to say that close to 75% of isekai are more popular than the average comedy or romance. This is the real value of isekai: it's hard to make a flop in another world. Anime distributors and publishers tend to use letter grades to denote the “level” of an anime, usually in terms of its revenue potential. As such, for an anime to be graded an “S” means it's anticipated to be an all-timer, in the top 5-10% of all series, an anime that will generate huge streaming audiences and many secondary streams of income. Isekai may be a reliable hitmaker, but it has a really hard time breaking into the “S” category. When you looked at the chart above, the first thing you may have noticed was, on a 100-point scale, how low the average anime was. The average “popularity score” for all 2024 TV anime was 10.1, with the median sitting just over a value of 5. The trio of top titles mentioned had just as much estimated viewership and interest in them as the bottom 120 combined. This kind of “feast or famine” distribution is fairly normal in media, but that doesn't make it any less hard as a consumer to conceptualize how big the gap is between a Solo Leveling and a Girls Band Cry is, particularly when they sit side-by-side on Crunchyroll and are discussed at similar rates on social media. As mentioned above, the top isekai anime of the year sits at rank #11 for the year: Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation. But with a popularity rating of just 33% that of Demon Slayer, is it fair to call it an “S”-level title? It's watched by a ton of people, yes, but is that all it takes to make an Attack on Titan-level hit? In English-speaking countries, it's not a top-seller for home video. The light novels haven't made the BookScan charts. The anime's licensee Crunchyroll isn't selling much branded apparel (though sublicense Ripple Junction has a dozen SKUs currently active), nor have there been any collaborations for other categories of licensed merchandise. This is the case for most isekai titles. Popular ones like Re:Zero and KONOSUBA fare a bit better in the specific verticals mentioned above, but generally speaking, isekai anime are less likely to see their rights exploited outside of streaming compared to similarly viewed shows. The factors behind this “always the bridesmaid, never the bride” situation can best be examined by understanding exactly who is watching isekai. What kind of person watches isekai? To answer this question, the best place to go is to the people who watch isekai. As part of White Box Entertainment's research for publishers, my team and I regularly survey self-identified anime fans in select English-speaking countries (the US, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa), and that gives us a good place to start looking at what the demographics and behaviors of this group are compared to anime fans at large: Considering a large percentage of the anime community watches isekai, it's impressive that this profile tells you anything about isekai fans, but the trends align with observed fan behavior to highlight key differences. Isekai fans, in short, watch more anime and have been watching anime for longer. There are slightly more males than the fandom at large, but only slightly (English-speaking countries are the only territories with a noticeable gender gap in viewership). Non-binary fans are proportionately less likely to watch isekai. We see parallels between merchandise and fandom activities: isekai fans are 22% less likely to listen to anime soundtracks or purchase any anime merchandise. There are many challenges with this kind of analysis, though. First, it's self-reported. People who fill out surveys have the distinct characteristic of being willing to fill out surveys, and while my team and I work hard to address that, it's a limitation for sure. Secondly, we can only be so thorough. For many traits, interests, and behaviors, isekai fans were essentially the same as the audience at large. One of those that was particularly interesting to me was the stated propensity to discuss anime online on social media: people watching at least a single isekai anime this season as well as self-identified isekai fans alike both said they discussed anime on social on the regular — at a higher rate than the broader survey sample! This stood out because, in my research, isekai is the genre with the lowest social media volume in English, particularly compared to viewership. Again, as with merchandise, there are certainly outliers, but one would hardly know The Most Notorious "Talker" Runs the World's Greatest Clan is one of the most-watched anime of the Fall in the US by browsing BlueSky, nor is it represented as well as similarly-viewed series in the English fanfiction, fanart, or cosplay spaces. The takeaway? People love to watch isekai, but when they engage in fandom activities, they're more likely to engage regarding a different anime they're keeping up with. The depth of their interest in isekai runs a bit more shallow. However, there's another complicating factor that plays a role in the decreased interest in fandom surrounding isekai anime: the backlash towards the genre in the community. You don't have to spend much time talking with anime fans to hear complaints about the volume of “isekai slop” and it's hard to blame long-time viewers in particular for their perspective: the quantity of new isekai hitting Japanese airwaves in any given week since 2022 is around the same number as the entire late-night anime roster combined as recently as 15 years ago. It begs the question, should isekai take up 15% of the TV anime scene? It's been almost two years since Steve Jones & Nicholas Dupree wrote “we've truly reached the bottom of the barrel” regarding isekai. It's been five years since Geoff Thew released a video called “Too Much Isekai” — and that was during a year with less than half of 2024's volume! These are far from the only content creators and editorial teams to feel this way, and it's reflected in the fandoms across political borders and languages. As we discussed earlier, isekai draws in viewers with a consistency not even “shonen action” can compete with. And compared to other forms of visual media with similar audience sizes, anime is extremely cheap to produce. If we wanted to make a perfectly economically efficient distribution for what the anime industry as a whole should produce, we would need more isekai, at least until its middle 50% of titles stopped performing so far above other genres. That said, not all popularity is equal. We're talking about art here, and there's a reason that so many of us have moments from anime first encountered decades ago that still resonate with us now. This emotional impact has business ramifications as well. Anime that can affect a broader audience has a broader reach, something that's of particular interest to the biggest purveyors of the medium in the Western world like Crunchyroll and Netflix. The challenging thing is trying to measure the qualitative reaction to anime. We've already explored how isekai anime, while generally strong performers are rarely considered “anime of the year” material by viewership. The same behavior is seen in the eyes of critics and fans. Since its inception in 2017, only two isekai have been nominated for the Crunchyroll Anime Award's top category, Re:Zero and Sonny Boy, the latter of which wholly ignores most conventions and tropes popular in the genre. Isekai is nowhere to be found in Anime News Network's Best Anime of 2024 list, and to find a representative of another world in the annual AOTY mega-poll results from ANN's readers, you'd have to go back to 2021. Whether it's on MyAnimeList, Crunchyroll, or IMdB, isekai ratings are virtually indistinguishable from other genres on average. I typically don't put stock in these sorts of user ratings, but isekai anime tends not to get enough critical reception to make it onto the likes of similarly misleading aggregators like Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes that are used as barometer of reception in polite company. As a result, I took the time to crank out MyAnimeList's ratings for isekai compared to other genres since the spike in 2019. The results can be found here: To start a list of important qualifications, according to my survey data and SimilarWeb, MyAnimeList skews male significantly more than most other anime websites. This is compounded by the fact that the users most likely to leave a rating are even more male and younger. People who use MyAnimeList are more likely to be deeply enfranchised compared to the anime audience as a whole. Additionally, most people will not leave a review for an anime they have no interest in even starting, and isekai are typically loud and obvious as to their nature, thus removing those who find them unpleasant as a rule from even giving them enough of a chance to leave a “3/10 dropped” from the calculation entirely. You can understand with all these issues with the data—as well as the novel's worth more I'm holding back for everyone's sake—that I don't take any platform's user ratings all too seriously in evaluating reception, even one as popular as MAL. That said, once we take this chart with a bucket of sand, the trend we saw with popularity is represented once again: isekai is generally received fairly well. Titles like Re:Zero and Mushoku Tensei have demonstrated that the genre's best are evaluated by the anime community without their genre being held against them, and titles like Sonny Boy and Ascendance of a Bookworm represent isekai's ability to cater to a more critically-inclined crowd. Breaking out the subgenres within isekai reveals how much the “cheat” sub-category drags down the rest. As you'll see from the analysis, I think there's a great case for cheat isekai's importance, but it's not as easily defined as something like a “reincarnation” isekai. A cheat isekai, to me, is a series where the protagonist has a disproportionate power-level advantage beyond the skills or knowledge they bring from another world. One of the loudest critiques of isekai characterizes the genre as power fantasies for those dissatisfied with their station, replete with wish fulfillment of every flavor. I find this to be a bit too broad of a brush, even when centering on the “cheat” subgenre that most closely aligns with the stereotype. But cheat isekai only represent 11% of the genre's output in recent years, and, perhaps more importantly in understanding why they're so visible, they're amongst the most watched. Using the same methodology for 2024 anime as above for the sub-genres, we find the average popularity of isekai TV anime as follows: This one requires a caveat as well if a smaller one. Many of these sub-genres or genre cross-overs are quite small; “villainess,” “slice of life,” and “transformation” are only represented by a pair of titles each for 2024. These trends are consistent enough over the years but as with the above chart, I'd encourage you to not treat it as gospel. That said, sub-genre performance only further demonstrates the power of isekai. All but two of isekai's particular classifications beat out drama, romance, and sports anime on average, and isekai crossover genres outperform equivalent non-isekai categories as well. For example, slice of life that's also isekai are 55% more popular on average than your standard iyashikei. I would not have anticipated romance as a category that benefits from a cross-genre with isekai, but the data show just that. You may also notice another trend comparing the two charts about isekai's subgenres, one that's represented across all media: critical evaluations seem to be negatively correlated with popularity. That is to say, the most popular isekai subgenres are the least well-regarded, and the most positively reviewed don't necessarily see much in the way of viewership. Such is the way it goes! Even though “reincarnation” is a consistent winner with viewers, since it represents such a significant share of all isekai, it's hard to parse out anything meaningful about whether the reincarnation element is an important quality to either viewers or critics. Transformation anime performs quite well, but much of this can be attributed to how strict I was in my definition. For classifying subgenres, I tried my best to aggregate tags and metadata across multiple platforms, but in the end, I had to rely on my own experience with these titles. For "transformation" I felt the category was compelling enough to crunch the numbers on, as many consider it a core element to many anime in the genre. However, “transformation” is a bit too broad of a topic. If we're to get metaphysical, almost any isekai contains a transformation of the protagonist(s), especially those involving reincarnation. In the end, after a strenuous debate with other isekai experts, I landed on the concept that an anime where the protagonist is no longer human would be the deciding line. Anything less drastic would lead to too many case-by-case subjective considerations and would, like with reincarnation, muddy the results. Thus, for 2024, the success of transformation isekai was all but certain. It's mostly due to two heavy-hitting franchises that have had regular seasons: That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime and Overlord. Aside from “cheat” isekai, most subgenres have grown at the same rate as isekai, their proportion of new anime produced staying more or less flat year-to-year. One subgenre where there's been a slight uptick in production as well as cause for extra attention is villainess isekai. While the title “otome isekai” is perhaps both more accurate and is used by many of the subgenre's most ardent adherents, it's known colloquially as “villainess” due to both the term's ubiquity in titles and its resonance with English-speaking audiences. Otome games are visual novels or otherwise story-driven games with a female target audience that focus on romance, often with a reverse-harem framing or opportunities to enjoy handsome gentlemen interacting with one another. In many, a villainess character is prominent: she is your primary adversary, your rival in love. And for many isekai anime aimed at the otome game audience, our protagonist finds themselves in the role not of the hero, but of the villainess! The subgenre's most well-known example is 2019's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, wherein the protagonist is magically trapped in the world of her favorite otome game in the villainess role. Besides being quite popular with its intended audience, My Next Life as a Villainess was something of a crossover hit, and became one of the year's more popular new titles, receiving not only a second season, but a film as well. Relative to other anime of similar popularity, isekai franchises tend to get fewer theatrical excursions than their contemporaries, so the fact that Catarina Claes's exploits made it to the big screen before Ains Ooal Gown is particularly notable. In the years since, there have been a handful of anime adaptations with similar concepts. Where this trend is even more noticeable in the world of Japanese web novels and light novels from which almost all isekai anime are adapted. Like isekai itself, villainess anime in the six years since My Next Life as a Villainess has performed consistently in both the West and in their native Japan, making the category attractive for producers looking to minimize risk. Already, we have anime adaptations for The Old Man Reincarnated As A Villainess, The Holy Grail of Eris, and The Dark History of the Reincarnated Villainess planned for this year or soon thereafter, but that's only considering anime based on Japanese works. South Korean manhwa/webcomics have had some of their biggest successes in the world of isekai, with villainess titles taking a more central position on trending lists on webtoon sites than their contemporaries in manga and Japanese light novels. With the increased interest in South Korean comics as source material for anime in recent years, including the mega-popular Solo Leveling and, in particular, the villainess isekai Why Raeliana Ended Up at the Duke's Mansion, I believe we'll see the continued growth of otome-styled isekai anime in the years ahead. The volume of new TV isekai seems to be in a steady state, if not growing ever slightly. It's one of anime's most popular genres and has become an iconic one, representative of many of everything the medium can offer. Like their Japanese counterparts, international audiences seem incredibly receptive to watching the majority of the isekai series released, even if they're not as keen on building a fandom around them. Similarly to the anime that adapt them, isekai manga and light novels may not be at the top of the charts, but many franchises are solid perennial sellers. Digging into sales numbers from Oricon, it's rare to see an isekai franchise in any manga top 10, but for everything concerning light novels, the genre is ever-present. I haven't seen any meta trends either in Japan or overseas that there's any kind of shift away from isekai in readership, and I see no reason to doubt that the supply of source material for more anime can sustain the current rate of adaptations. Which brings us to the future. As The New York Times reported last year, nearly every anime studio was booked for years out, and that issue hasn't changed since. The anime currently in production or penciled in with studios aren't necessarily locked in, but shifting what's already queued works against the risk-averse philosophies of most publishers. Earlier, I noted how the “sudden” spike in anime production was essentially on a 3 to 4-year delay from when the genre started to deliver outsized results around the globe. Similarly, we'd need to see a significant downside in the financials related to producing isekai anime for the trend to reverse, and even then, there'd be a years-long gap to be meaningfully felt. To be clear, the opposite is happening. Isekai is a low-risk, high-reward genre for anime producers, just as much now during peak isekai as it ever was. Even a poorly performing isekai delivers outsized results compared to any other genre, almost as if the label is a “one weird trick” for producers. It was a technique that likely brought about WarnerMedia's Suicide Squad ISEKAI, an anime with a conceit that was so compelling that it spent 16 days on Max's top 10 in the United States last year, suggesting viewership in the millions in America alone. Isekai is not just continuing to get produced at incredible rates: it's getting preferential treatment in 2025. Crunchyroll typically dubs 15-20 simulcasts in a season, but with more than double that in terms of new anime, Big Orange needs to prioritize. Tellingly, nearly every isekai premiering this month is on the list of Q1 dubs, with isekai representing more than 40% of Crunchyroll's dub output. For 2025 and into the future, isekai is a core part of the popular conception of anime. While I don't think we'll see an isekai reach the level of mega-hits like Jujutsu Kaisen and Demon Slayer, the anime industry can hardly be faulted for investing so heavily in the genre when it's continued to find such consistent success with little indication of flagging. Isekai seems resilient to negative sentiment in the community, and audiences have shown a consistent interest in new IP based on the genre alone. The state of isekai is strong, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here. Feature homepage / archives

Title: Elon Musk bashes the $500 billion 'Stargate' deal between OpenAI and SoftBank — and backed by Trump
URL: https://qz.com/elon-musk-stargate-ai-openai-trump-softbank-nvidia-1851744596
Time Published: 2025-01-22T13:22:00Z
Full Content:
Elon Musk is already casting doubt on OpenAI’s new, up to $500 billion investment deal with SoftBank (SFTBY-2.05%) and Oracle (ORCL+0.36%), despite backing from his allies — including President Donald Trump. The companies are teaming up for what they call the “Stargate Project,” presumably named after the sci-fi franchise, which aims to spend $500 billion over the next four years building artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.S. The companies said Tuesday that they would begin deploying $100 billion “immediately,” which will “generate massive economic benefit for the entire world.” As the deal was announced Tuesday in the White House, Trump — standing alongside Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son — said the group would create a “new American company” that would generate more than 100,000 U.S. jobs. Ellison said the group’s first project, a one-million-square-foot data project, is already underway in Texas. There’s just one problem with Stargate, according to Musk, an OpenAI co-founder who has since sued to block it and Altman’s plans: They don’t have the cash. “They don’t actually have the money,” the Tesla (TSLA-0.78%) CEO and close Trump ally said shortly before midnight on Tuesday, in a post on his social media site X. “SoftBank has well under $10 [billion] secured. I have that on good authority,” Musk added just before 1 a.m. ET. His comments marked a rare split between the world’s richest man and Trump, who took office on Monday. Musk was one of Trump’s biggest financial backers during the 2024 presidential campaign and has been given his own task force, nicknamed DOGE, and staff. The Trump administration is already facing at least four lawsuits over DOGE. Musk’s remarks also show that, despite Altman and Amazon (AMZN-0.59%) founder Jeff Bezos’ comments last month, Musk isn’t content to sit by as his rivals profit from the new Trump administration. Altman said in December that he believes “pretty strongly that Elon would do the right thing and that it would be profoundly un-American to use political power” against business rivals. Besides Musk’s long-standing feud with Altman and litigation, he also founded an AI startup, xAI, to compete with OpenAI and other firms. xAI last month raised $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation, less than two years after he founded the company. That cash is expected to help xAI expand its Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, which it developed with Nvidia (NVDA-0.58%) chips. xAI also works closely with Musk’s X. His social media platform, formerly Twitter, employs Grok, a chatbot developed by his xAI startup. Ellison is an investor in X, formerly served on Tesla’s board, and the pair of billionaires have a longtime friendship. “[I] genuinely respect your accomplishments and think you are the most inspiring entrepreneur of our time,” Altman said Wednesday in reply to Musk’s accusations. Altman followed up by saying that Musk’s allegations are “wrong, as you surely know,” before inviting him to visit the site in Texas. “[T]his is great for the country,” Altman said. “[I] realize what is great for the country isn’t always what’s optimal for your companies, but in your new role [I] hope you’ll mostly put [America] first.” Stargate will be chaired by Son, whose SoftBank will have financial responsibility for the company, while OpenAI handles the operations. Those companies, along with Oracle and MGX, are the initial equity backers. SoftBank-backed Arm, Microsoft (MSFT-0.61%), and Nvidia will work with Oracle and OpenAI on the technology. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told CNBC on Wednesday that “I’m good for my $80 billion. I’m going to spend $80 billion building out Azure.” The initial $100 billion comes from a number of sources, including equity from the founding partners and co-investors, as well as third-party debt, according to a source familiar with the matter. Additional investors are expected to be brought on and help fund the project over its lifetime. “All of us look forward to continuing to build and develop AI—and in particular AGI—for the benefit of all of humanity,” OpenAI and SoftBank said in a statement. “We believe that this new step is critical on the path, and will enable creative people to figure out how to use AI to elevate humanity.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Permuto Capital management team In perhaps one of the very first instances of blockchain solving a real-world problem, and a little financial alchemy through the creation of additional value through the transformation of a standard financial asset, Permuto Capital has created the next big thing for equity investors. Permuto Capital is launching a product to unbundle the dividend and capital components of common stock and by appealing to different investor groups the sum value of the two elements may be greater than the value of the underlying stock. Permuto filed a registration statement with the SEC, and upon approval, expects to launch with Microsoft (MSFT) as their first equity. Separation of the economic components of financial instruments is not in itself a new idea. In the 1980s the government permitted coupon stripping of U.S. Treasury securities (notes and bonds), a process where the interest and principal components are partitioned into discrete securities and are termed “STRIPS” (Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities). The components appeal to different segments of investors, and the product thereby improves the efficiency of the overall market. Similar in concept to Treasury stripping, the Permuto product cleaves a Microsoft common share into two: a “dividend certificate” and an “appreciation certificate.” The owner of the dividend certificate will be entitled to the dividends paid by Microsoft on the common share, and the appreciation certificate will represent entitlement to everything else. The “secret sauce” for Permuto that makes their product viable whereas previous incarnations were considered too cumbersome and expensive for widespread distribution is twofold: the advantages of blockchain technology coupled with the use of single stock voting trusts to hold the shares and issue the certificates. The Voting Trust structure provides a regulatory compliant structure, and the blockchain reduces costs. The idea is that investors that hold Microsoft common shares may deposit the shares with a designated custodian, and in return the investor receives one of each of the two certificates. Once the certificates are created, they will trade independently, and hence the investor that deposited the shares may sell one, or both, of the certificates, and other investors may purchase certificates without having owned the underlying shares. An investor who owns both types of certificates may return them to the trust and receive back a common share. For an investor who wishes to use traditional platforms Permuto is seeking to have both types of certificates listed on a nationally recognized stock exchange, and the investor may elect for the Depository Trust Company (DTC) to hold their certificates. Alternatively, investors may choose to hold their certificates on the Chia blockchain as Chia Asset Tokens (CATs). One advantage of the CATs is that they will be able to be traded on decentralized marketplaces 24 hours a day, every day, and not be subject to exchange trading halts. The key advantage of the blockchain technology is cost savings. In addition to the reduction in trading fees from decentralized marketplaces when compared to traditional stock exchanges, the blockchain provides a cost-efficient mechanism for distribution of the dividend payments. Permuto charges for the processing of dividend payments, and there is a nominal fee for the creation or redemption of the certificates. When dividend certificates are held at the DTC Permuto pays the investor 80% of the dividend and retains 20% for processing costs. Better yet, given that costs are significantly lower on the Chia blockchain, an investor holding a CAT will receive 90% of the dividend payments. This difference implies that the dividend certificate should trade for a higher price as a CAT than on the traditional markets. If the assumptions are simplified a quick valuation may be calculated. Using a Microsoft share price of $429 and an annual dividend of $3.32, and assuming that the dividend increases 5% per year of which 90% is returned to the investor, the investor in the dividend certificate will receive $198.50 over thirty years. That is not the price that investor will pay today, however, as money has a greater value today than if received some point in the future. By assuming that money is worth 8% less per year, that dividend certificate will have a value of $45.46. A dividend certificate with that value returns an annual yield of 6.6%. The appreciation certificate should therefore have the value of $429 - $45.46 = $383.23. This simple calculation demonstrates how an investor may value the two elements of the common share. The benefit to investors is that they may allocate their investment capital directly according to their investment preferences, and may receive a string of dividend payments or no dividend payments and only the capital appreciation of the shares. According to Trent Martensen, Co-CEO Permuto Capital, “The ability to choose and manipulate risk exposure assuming a given return requirement is an objective for all investors, and by partitioning common shares into dividends and capital appreciation we are providing investors tools to fine tune their portfolios.” In finance grad school in the late 1980s and early 1990s discussions about financial engineering and structuring of risks often included dividends and how a given dividend stream may not be well priced for a given common stock. Only now are the tools available to deliver standardized products to investors, and Permuto certificates could be the answer to those questions from long ago. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Inside A Real Estate Billionaire’s Fight To Revive His Aging Empire

Full Content:
OnJanuary 15, real estate billionaire Charles Cohen called Forbes from a no caller ID phone, as he always does. For four months, Forbes had been trying to get Cohen to sit down and discuss the mounting debt and vacancies at the buildings owned by his real estate firm, Cohen Brothers Realty. In September he said to check back in November. In November, he said to call in January. Last week, Cohen said he was going on vacation. He didn’t specify where, but he often jets to his vineyard in the south of France, Château de Chausse, or his Palm Beach penthouse. (He also has apartments in West Hollywood and Manhattan and a sprawling home in Greenwich, Connecticut.) Then he asked if the story could be delayed once again for four to six weeks, when he would explain how his firm had “turned the corner.” “If you run a negative story, it's going to hurt me,” he said, mentioning several refinancings and new leases he claimed were in the works. “It makes it harder for us to rent when people think there's a problem that really isn't a problem." Cohen finally relented, only after Forbes explained the story would run regardless, and had his executive vice president sit down with Forbes to go over financials. There is no doubt that Cohen, who took over his father and uncles’ firm in the 1980s and expanded it by building and buying prime office towers in midtown Manhattan, now finds himself in a tricky spot. Since the pandemic emptied offices, many of his prized properties lost tenants. At least six of his buildings sit more than 20% empty, with three of those less than 60% occupied. At the same time, he’s struggled to make payments on at least $1.1 billion in debt according to loan filings and court documents, resulting in the loss of four properties at a foreclosure auction in November. All of that has dealt a blow to Cohen and his fortune, which peaked at $3.7 billion in 2022, when he was flush with cash and interest rates were near zero. Forbes now estimates he’s worth $1.6 billion. About two-thirds of that lies in his real estate holdings, which have lost value as tenants fled to newer, amenity-rich skyscrapers. Cohen disputes the valuation, claiming it should be higher. Steven Cherniak, Cohen Brothers’ chief operating officer, said that the firm is up-to-date on loan payments for buildings that carry more than half that $1.1 billion debt load. Plus, Cherniak is confident the properties will land more tenants in the first half of this year. Cohen’s troubles made headlines on November 8th, when one of the largest foreclosure auctions in New York history took place. Up for sale were five of his holdings: an 800,000-square foot office and design complex in Dania Beach, Florida, a nearby Le Meridien hotel, a former hotel site in Rye Brook, New York, and theater chains in the U.S. and the U.K. At the end of the bidding process, Cohen’s creditor, Fortress Investment Group, walked away with nearly everything, paying just under $150 million for the design complex, hotel, U.K. theater chain and Rye Brook site. No one bothered to bid on the U.S. chain Landmark Theaters, with its 28 locations and concessions business, leaving them in Cohen’s hands. It was the latest episode in a long-running battle between Cohen and Fortress. The lender sued Cohen last March, seeking repayment of a $534 million loan secured by the properties. Representatives for Fortress didn’t respond to a request for comment. Cohen and his company counter-sued. The auction, for which Cohen was a no show, was another setback for the real estate mogul and movie buff. For years, the collection of office towers in midtown Manhattan he’d assembled provided steady profits. He then expanded into design centers and indulged his passion for film, producing several Oscar-nominated films (and one best foreign-language film winner, “The Salesman”), buying arthouse theater chains and launching a film distribution business. He also bought a 135-acre vineyard and estate in France in 2016 and men's high-end footwear brand Harry’s of London a year later. But in the past two years, he’s had to deal with mounting troubles at his office towers. He lost several major tenants—including WeWork, which vacated more than 200,000 square feet at several properties while keeping much less space—and debts racked up as repayment dates loomed. His buildings struggled to compete with brand new skyscrapers with luxury amenities, making it tougher to replace those leases, according to several brokers. High interest rates also made it harder to refinance, and when he did—as with the Fortress loan—it was on unfavorable terms. At the same time, the rest of his empire also took a hit. The pandemic shuttered his theaters across the country, and his design centers lost tenants, too: he lost the one in Florida to Fortress but has three more, including two in Los Angeles and New York where occupancy has dipped below 80%. For his part, Cohen insists the picture isn’t as bad as it looks, pointing to better leasing activity and a recent uptick in sales of office buildings. At one of his properties, 750 Lexington Avenue—home to the headquarters of his firm—the lender filed for foreclosure in May, a month after the building was reappraised at just $50 million, down from $300 million in 2015. But the foreclosure has stalled, while one tenant, beauty retailer Sephora, renewed its lease and another tenant, WeWork, kept its lease after emerging from bankruptcy. Cohen Brothers is working on a loan modification with the lender. “We're doing fine. We've got leasing challenges, which everyone has, but we've got good buildings,” Cohen told Forbes in a phone call 10 days after the auction in November. “We have very strong tenant retention and expansion, and we're probably doing more leasing than a lot of other people.” Outside of New York, he’s expecting to break ground soon on a 23-story, glass-clad office tower in West Palm Beach, where demand for office space remains strong, especially for new buildings. “I'm doing everything that I need to do everywhere,” he asserted. Cohen's 750 Lexington Avenue, a 28-story tower with tenants including Sephora and WeWork, is 27% vacant and was reappraised in April 2024 at $50 million, down from $300 million in 2015. Cohen was born in 1952 into a real estate family in Harrison, north of New York City. His father, Sherman, was a former car dealer who built Cohen Brothers Realty with his two brothers; the siblings eventually grew it to more than 20 buildings across Manhattan. As a young child, Cohen was more interested in show business, developing a love for movies after his grandmother took him to see Cinderella at age 3. By the time he was a teenager, Cohen was showing apartments for his family’s real estate firm. But he also knew he wanted to become a director and even shot a few short films. “When I turned 14, I stopped following the Yankees and started reading Variety,” he told Forbes in 2017. “There was nothing more exciting to me than being in line to see a movie when it opened.” It would be a while before he pursued his filmmaking dreams. The first in his family to graduate from college, he got his bachelor’s at Tufts University in 1974 and a law degree from Brooklyn Law School in 1977 before working in Chemical Bank's real estate division in New York for a couple of years. He then joined his family’s firm and rose to become vice president and general counsel by 1981. Just two years later, he became president and bought out his father’s and uncle’s stakes in the company for an undisclosed sum. One of his signature deals was the construction of 750 Lexington Avenue. Cohen bought up the entire block between 59th and 60th streets in the 1980s to build it. (One resident on the block held out and refused to sell her townhouse, leading Cohen to build the 28-story tower around it; it’s still there) Cohen expanded into design centers in the 1990s, purchasing the Decoration and Design building in Manhattan for $63 million in 1996 and adding the Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles and the Design Center of the Americas in Florida three years later for an undisclosed sum. By 2009, he had expanded the firm to more than 12 million square feet of real estate—up from 3 million when he took over in the 1980s. At the time, he also pivoted back to his fervor for filmmaking. He put up half the budget for the independent film “Frozen River,” which won the Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize in 2008, and then set up a movie distribution business the same year. Over the following decade, he picked up a historic film collection, a small-screen theater in Manhattan plus Landmark and Curzon, two theater chains in the U.S. and the U.K. He also began spending more time in France, purchasing the Château de Chausse wine estate in Provence in 2016 for $20 million and picking up a historic Japanese-style theater in Paris a year later. He joined The Forbes 400 list of richest Americans for the first time in 2016 with an estimated $2.8 billion net worth. That same year, coworking outfit WeWork leased four floors at Cohen's office tower on East 57th St. By 2018, the startup had expanded to 123,000 square feet there and also took more than 80,000 square feet at 750 Lexington. When WeWork’s public listing collapsed in September 2019, Cohen was left with a looming leasing problem as the startup’s cash was predicted to dry up. Six months later, the Covid-19 pandemic hit. The downturn was devastating for New York office landlords. By the end of 2020, the value of the city’s office buildings had fallen by 45%, an estimated $50 billion decline, according to a research paper published in 2022 by Columbia and New York University professors Arpit Gupta, Vrinda Mittal and Stijn van Nieuwerburgh. “In the future, this period of time will be called the great valuation reset,” says longtime New York real estate broker Bob Knakal. “People have to get tuned in with the reality of what the present market is.” Cohen, though, had locked in fixed-rate loans on several of his largest properties—including 750 Lexington Ave and the New York design center—in the years before the pandemic. In 2022, as the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates to battle high inflation, he chose to take advantage before rates got too high. In September that year he refinanced four properties and the two theater chains with a $534 million loan from Fortress. According to financial documents revealed in the Fortress lawsuit, Cohen’s empire was already feeling the pain by the 2022 refinancing. An independent auditor's report compiled in December 2022 stated that the firm was dealing with “net operating losses” and “high vacancy rates” which “raise substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.” The report also noted that the firm had pursued “significant efforts to increase occupancy and cost control measures” and also had “adequate cash resources and business continuity plans.” In the spring of 2023, Forbes investigated the collapse of commercial real estate values across major cities in the U.S. “You’ve got to be defensive,” Cohen told Forbes at the time, when asked about his strategy to survive the downturn. On his debt, he said: “It’s not an issue of imminent concern to me. We’re keeping lenders apprised of what’s going on, being transparent, explaining why things are the way they are.” Throughout the rest of that year, Cohen and Fortress extended the payment schedule on the loan and deferred payments, according to court filings. In November 2023, WeWork filed for bankruptcy and vacated more than 200,000 square feet at two Cohen properties in Los Angeles and New York—the latter bearing a mortgage owed to Fortress, and where WeWork had leased nearly a third of the total space. Tensions came to a head in February 2024, when Cohen and Fortress were negotiating a further extension. In emails revealed in court records, Cohen pushed back on Fortress' proposal but expressed hope that they would come to an agreement: “Over the last 20-plus years, we have always found a way forward together.” Dean Dakolias, Fortress' co-chairman and managing partner, fired back a blunt response. “Your last proposal was unrealistic and took us several steps backwards,” he wrote. “You’ve not made your last payment, and you’ve not demonstrated that you understand or prioritize the severity of your situation.” The next month, Fortress sued Cohen and demanded full repayment of the more than half billion loan, as well as a personal guaranty of up to $187 million—plus interest—from Cohen. Cohen counter-sued a month later, seeking to have the lawsuit dismissed and alleging that Fortress had reneged on an agreement to extend the loan. Fortress had demanded a foreclosure auction on Cohen’s properties in May, but a judge ruled in Cohen's favor in June and agreed to postpone it. In August, it was put on the schedule for November. In October, Cohen suffered another blow when the judge in the case ruled that Cohen had to pay the personal guaranty on the properties. (Cohen filed an appeal 11 days later, which is still pending.) Still, Cohen appeared to have more than enough resources to foot the bill: he had nearly $300 million in cash and investments as of June last year. According to Fortress, Cohen then attempted to shield his personal assets so they couldn’t be taken from him to cover the guaranty. The firm’s lawyers alleged that Cohen had transferred ownership of his 219-foot, $50 million yacht Seasense and three smaller vessels to offshore entities in the Cayman Islands, while shifting ownership of his $20 million home in Greenwich, Connecticut to his wife Clo, a former Jimmy Choo executive. Cohen hit back, stating that it was just routine estate planning, but Fortress won a court judgment in the Cayman Islands delaying the transfer. Cohen is also fighting the $187 million personal guaranty demanded by Fortress. In a filing ten days after the auction, Cohen's lawyers argued that the auction sales mean that the guaranty amount should be reduced by $75 million to account for the sale of the assets and the release of a lien on another Cohen property. In December, his lawyers also argued that Cohen had nearly $350 million in equity in four buildings—3 Park Avenue, 979 Third Avenue, 805 Third Avenue and 622 Third Avenue— sufficient to cover the remainder of what he owes to Fortress. Once again, Fortress disputed his claim, pointing to the fact that those values were based “on stale, year-old valuations” that have declined since then, and that all four properties are burdened with outstanding mortgages. The proceedings are still ongoing. Cohen's private theater at his Greenwich, Connecticut mansion cost $1 million to build and features a curved movie screen and a sculpture of a ticket collector handmade by a Massachusetts artisan. Outside of the Fortress dispute, Cohen is still saddled with several debt-laden buildings that are showing their age. And while he had less leverage on his buildings than other Manhattan real estate tycoons, he was particularly vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic due to his concentration in older office towers. “It's difficult for the owner of a Class B office building to make their buildings competitive with Class A product,” says Knakal, referring to older properties compared to newer construction like Hudson Yards or One Vanderbilt, which is fully occupied. “We're talking about declines in the order of 30% to 50% in value on average," adds Tomasz Piskorski, a professor of real estate at Columbia Business School. For real estate moguls with their wealth tied up in office towers, “it means they may no longer be billionaires.” In a bid to entice tenants, many owners of older properties are now offering as much as a year of free rent as well as pricey allowances for improvements. But Cohen sees that as a losing proposition. “We're only doing deals that make sense. A lot of our competition is just throwing money at deals,” he said in November. Cohen insists he’s working on improving his buildings to make them more competitive, arguing that they should be valued higher now due to recent transactions such as a November deal that valued S.L. Green’s One Vanderbilt at $4.7 billion and the December sales of two office towers on Park Avenue. “We're finishing up a major lobby renovation at 622 Third,” he said. “We're reinvesting in our buildings.” Those renovations are now complete, according to chief operating officer Cherniak, including a $13 million new lobby and exterior facade at 3 Park Avenue. Cohen’s also bullish on new lease activity to replace his vacancies. In Los Angeles, the space left by WeWork has been filled by the hospital and health science center Cedars-Sinai, an existing tenant. In New York, the firm expects to sign new leases at five of its least occupied towers in the coming months. Cohen may have a point: Office leasing activity in Manhattan increased 17% year-over-year in 2024, the highest since 2019, according to real estate brokerage Avison Young. Still, older or lower-quality properties made up just 23% of new leasing last year, and rents at those buildings are only about half what’s charged by trophy buildings—a sign that the resurgence in leasing is leaving many of these aging towers behind as tenants continue to opt for newer ones. Another strategy he has: converting office space to residential apartments and condos. In May, his firm filed for a special permit to convert 19 floors of its 38-story tower at 623 Fifth Avenue—across from the Rockefeller Center and atop Saks’ Fifth Avenue’s flagship store—to 172 condos. The project has since been scaled down to 60 to 70 condos, per Cherniak, but the firm is working on design plans. Another condo conversion project at 3 East 54th Street, which has views of Central Park, is further along, with the firm finishing the interior demolition last summer. “They’re all moving forward,” said Cohen. Yet the lender on the 54th Street property filed for foreclosure in December, putting that project in doubt. (Cohen says he is in the process of refinancing the loan.) Another proposed conversion at 135 East 57th Street is now dead in the water. The Wallace family, which owns the ground underneath that building, opposed the conversion project and sued Cohen over unpaid rent in December 2023. In October, a judge ruled in the family’s favor, handing the building over to them. According to New York office brokers who spoke with Forbes, if Cohen is able to follow through on the conversions, work with his lenders on the troubled properties and hold onto the buildings he wants while sacrificing others, he could survive the threats to his empire. As his appeal on the Fortress case works its way through the courts, Cohen is looking south toward his planned 23-story, 400,000-square-foot tower in West Palm Beach, named West Palm Point. Located close by two other office projects being developed by billionaires—Stephen Ross’ One Flagler and Jeff Greene’s One West Palm—the three edifices-in-progess form part of what has been called “Wall Street South,” as financial firms from BlackRock to Citadel open offices in the fast-growing city. Together they will add nearly 900,000 square feet of office space. Cohen’s building there, which is set to break ground in March, is expected to be finished in 2028. He plans to finance the construction with a mix of equity and loans. That could be a smart bet for Cohen, with Donald Trump’s election spurring business magnates and world leaders to flock to Palm Beach for its proximity to the new president’s Winter White House at Mar-a-Lago. According to Cherniak, the firm has already negotiated leases for six floors. “We have all our approvals. The contracting is just about complete and we're getting ready to close our loans and break ground,” Cohen said in November. “We've got leasing activity underway already." As for the legal battles, Cohen is going to keep fighting. “I'm not paying that personal guaranty. I've got defenses, I've got an appeal pending in the appellate division,” he said. “It's not over by a long shot."

But a stray thought popped up in my mind. Trump wants to take an axe to the Federal government, right? So I wondered if Trump was thinking about privatizing the CDC, the FDA and the NIH in his second term. I’m sure that the health care corporations would like to buy them up and run them the way that they should be. Don’t they already recieve more than 50 percent of their budgets from private companies? Seems like that would be more honest On the other hand, those government labs spend billions to develop new drugs which are then handed over to Big Pharma corporations who work out the dosage and then slap their patent on it. Can you imagine if it was the US government slapping their own patents on those new drugs and funneling back the profits for new research? I can! This is the US government shutting down public access to public information. Expect anything unfiltered that’s related to energy, climate, environment, health, to go dark soon, along with any potentially embarrassing open-ended data services like FRED. Privatization comes later, once DOGE is up and running. If you have any favorite public data sets, download them now. We’re going to need them. As a physician, I have been used to looking at these datasets for decades. Reports, MMWR, etc. At no time in our history until the Biden Admin was there suppression of data. The Biden Administration literally seemed to live to do that. Even during the dark days of the AIDS epidemic, there was no restriction in the free flow of information. Please note, it took months to compile – so there was quite a delay and that is understandable and that is not what I am talking about. The free flow of information continued through COVID during the Trump years. And then once the vaccines came out and there started to be “issues, the adults that were put back in charge with Biden – suddenly caused all kinds of data flows to come to an end. The US govt did shut down public access to health information – this was started under Biden – and I have never seen anything like it in my life. As to downloading public data sets, hope you are looking for something anodyne and non-problematic. All of the other stuff is long gone – and when you do download something – it is not really anything that you can use to make any kind of judgements. As I have stated from the being – release every scrap of raw data down to the finest details – just like we have done for a long time. No one is listening. My wife and I were discussing decreasing access to data (again) this morning. Pretty glum about the current state of affairs. Trying to find some glimmer of hope, I would hope RFK jr understands the value of having data in the public domain. My worry is that, in addition to being damning to Pfizer in that specific case, generally speaking, public health data has monetary value. There’s a fog of war element to these opening days of the 47th. The state data on SARS infections went dark in the west coast states in May of 2023. The governors of WA, OR, and CA marched in lockstep during the early pandemic. I don’t know if it’s my inexperience with the system, but I have not been able to find overall mortality data for the US 2015-2019 plus 2020 on from the CDC site. I’d like to make my own excess analysis. On the other hand, this certainly doesn’t help the situation any, either. Like with other issues, Trump is doing the same thing as the Democrats, only louder. This kind of situation is what makes me believe the binary political parties are no solution for the problems we face. Looks like the Chinese are doing AI right. How much longer before BRICS nations figure out that copyright law keeps people from using personal computers like Star Trek replicators? It’s past time to legally and Constitutionally clarify the legality of making digital copies. Western capitalism has failed in every respect, giving BRICS an easy way to blow up Hollywood™©®’s absurdly punitive civil damages laws. Never forget that Congress passed a law allowing music downloaders to be sued for up to $20,000US per song or about a quarter of a million dollars per record album. The vast majority of new music is created, edited and released on equipment that costs well under $20,000. How does this make sense? Copyright is governed on the country-by-country basis. Length in majority of countries is 50 years and in many of them civil damages are negligible to a point where there is zero enforcement. Insane penalties and over-the-top enforcement are mostly restricted to US, Canada and Europe, mostly due to trade treaties signed with US. Insane copyright protection was one of the pillars of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and was one of the reasons it failed. Sorry but that’s not correct. Copyright is governed under the Berne and Rome Conventions and the WIPO copyright treaty. Member countries transpose the treaties into their law, but agree to respect minimum protection. Most all countries are members. The term is usually either 50 or 70 years plus the life of the author. I started my legal career in IP and I’d recommend that you read a little more about it if you’re interested. It’s a fascinating subject and there are lots and lots of arguments about length, fair use, right to private copies, moral rights, neighboring rights (my old specialty, dear to my heart) and other somewhat arcane stuff. Imho, artists, composers and authors deserve some legal monopoly over their works for a limited period of time. Software got jammed into copyright by idiots. I’m done. Software got jammed into copyright by idiots. When I read this I stood up and applauded, tears running down my cheeks. Thanks. It’s my passionate belief as well. Can you believe that Microsoft Windows 3.0, released in 1990, will only be in the public domain in 2085? (95 years after published date for works for hire) Being a legal non-expert: This issue is of paramount importance nobody addresses adequately in public. As I see it, copyright only is an inadequate remedy in a capitalist system. Besides personal vanity for most artists and inventors IP regulation is (was) a means to make a living. If state services were free, apartments free, basic income guaranteed and all the other idealist concepts were to be realized (not in our lifetime) copyright would need not be. “Dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants” for me always meant that the giants themselves were consisting of dwarfs. Meaning we all are dwarfs. Which would sum up the creation and expansion of human knowledge and creative output over millennia. “Piracy the obvious choice” is the thing Cory Doctorow used to talk about before deciding to be social activist. If we want to go to war over our IP with what kind of aircraft carrier will we defend it? A trade war with China may mean they will once again revert to copying, er, pirating all our movies and software. And in the process they are developing the skills to not need our IP. It’s likely that when it comes to both China and Russia Trump doesn’t really realize what he is dealing with. US soft power is evaporating leaving only the hopefully empty military threats. DJT needs to stick to picking on Greenland. Or maybe he does realize all this and is just posturing. And it’s not like his predecessor seemed to realize either. Interesting times. He still does. I think it’s been previously linked here, but that was the gist of his recent rant re Trump’s tarrif threat. https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/15/beauty-eh/#its-the-only-war-the-yankees-lost-except-for-vietnam-and-also-the-alamo-and-the-bay-of-ham Makes sense, it’s the kind of asymmetric warfare that would quickly sharpen C-suite attention south of the border, much more than retaliatory tariffs, which only increase profits along with consumer prices. To bad our oligarchy is in bed with their oligarchy and it’ll never happen. I definitely like it. “Piracy, the obvious choice” These are a very important series of comments: important for development countries but critically important for the developing. Important for understand equity in all countries. When I was in Hanoi, Vietnam a couple of years ago there were motorcycles everywhere and I thought the Japanese were dominant even with expensive cycles. Finally, I noticed that I was not seeing so many Hondas but “Honkas.” Honkas—love it There is not a lot of data on this topic, but outside the u.s. and europe most university students rely on piracy to acquire textbooks. Ironically, this means that they have access to a much broader selection of books than their 1st world counterparts. My US college student does that too, please. I told her it ain’t what you steal, but who you steal it from My Canadian university students get their textbooks from “Uncle Vlad”. Soft power at its most powerful… Just look at Elsevier which is a rip-off of epic proportions. On the other hand in German university libraries where non-staff can have easy access too De Gruyter e.g. offers most studies as open access. >Trump announces an up to $500 billion AI infrastructure investment involving OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank Business Insider OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, and SoftBank chief executive Masayoshi Son attended the White House announcement. Would that be the same “Sam Altman” that Suchir Balaji, who was a whistleblower that mysteriously committed one of the most improbable suicides I’ve ever heard about, worked for? Larry Ellison, would that be the pro-Israel zionist who donated $17M to IDF recently? My Twitter feed is lite up with people who were very dubious of the rushed mRNA technology used for CV19 chiming in on what a Trump sell-out this is. David Icke is actually starting to make sense to some, these oligarchs are reptiles, reptilian at the very least. Going from transgender to transhuman? 500 Billion dollars, that would go a long way to help some desperate people drowning under pile of hospital bill debts, local clinics, etc… that would go a long way to ease the servitude of millions of young people struggling to make monthly payments on student loans. It’s also very interesting that this is being sold as a personalized openAI solution for fighting cancer. No wonder all those tech billionaries who loathed Trump, where sitting all together during inauguration smiling. Also, didn’t Russia just announce that they found a mRNA vaccine for cancer and would be making it available for free? Sounds very similar. Stargate, StarLink, twinkle, twinkle little star, I’m not going where you are… https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/russia-vaccine-cancer-9744034/ Zaganostra: … didn’t Russia just announce that they found a mRNA vaccine for cancer [1] There is not and cannot be one single mRNA vaccine for the many, many different types of tumors that develop in all the different cell-types throughout the human body, as far as I know. The whole point of such vaccines is the targeting specificity they’d provide. And yes, each vaccine would be personalized — that’s the point of them. [2] Nor is there anything new about mRNA vaccines for cancer, or anyway the concept. Moderna was originally founded in 2010-2014 specifically to develop such vaccines, and got repurposed when COVID-19 appeared. <Would that be the same “Sam Altman” that Suchir Balaji, who was a whistleblower that mysteriously committed one of the most improbable suicides I’ve ever heard about, worked for? “Derrick Broze speaks to Poornima Rao, the mother of Suchir Balaji, the OpenAI whistleblower who was found dead on November 26, 2024.

I’m shocked. /s. Good thing trump will make sure the tech oligarchs get $500B asap. also /s. 500 Billion dollars, that would go a long way to make someone a first trillionaire. No wonder it brings smiles to faces of billionaries. “Zelensky demands at least 200,000 ‘peacekeepers’ on Ukrainian soil – Reuters” ‘From all the Europeans? 200,000, it’s a minimum. It’s a minimum, otherwise it’s nothing’ He’s talking about NATO troops of course but 200,000? Wouldn’t that be like all the available troops that NATO has? Check out this page on the number of active military personnel in NATO countries in 2024- https://www.statista.com/statistics/584286/number-of-military-personnel-in-nato-countries/ The 5th largest contingent is the UK at 184,860 but that is like the entire UK military as in all of them. How many can the British Army send to the Ukraine then? I would guesstimate about 10,000 people – maybe. You start going through the numbers for each country on that basis and it does not add up to 200,000 people. The only way that it does is by having troops come from that country to the north of the Gulf of America which is what Zelensky is really talking about. But there would be a side “benefit” to having so many peacekeepers in the Ukraine. This Ukrainian guy was saying that they had lost so many men that the country is going to be a demographic disaster. Unless of course you had say 200,000 lonely men on duty in that country that could hook up with all those widows and single women and then problem solved. It made a bizarre sort of sense but more likely those women would use those soldiers as a ticket out of the country to one that is much safer. The Danish F 16 instructor allegedly killed in Ukraine by a Russian missile strike, had supposedly been ‘entertained’ by a Ukrainian woman who subsequently gave his whereabouts away to the Russians. Of course, the story has been denied by Danish authorities, but I did see a tweet in Danish by a guy claiming to know the instructor and that he was dead. Who knows in the Fogh (sic) of war. So maybe these widows and single women could also use them as a ticket to safety in Russia. I’m contractually obliged to report that I have just posted an essay on the idea of a “peacekeeping” force in Ukraine, and related issues. Since any European peacekeepers are by definition NATO soldiers, you think that they would go with the idea of Chinese peacekeepers? To your numbers, Rev, In believe that to deploy 200.000 “peacekeepers” in Ukraine, all in all, 600.000 troops should have to be mobilised accounting for the required rotations. “Entertainers” would be needed a lot, not only in Ukraine, but in nearby reserve places. Romania, Poland? Oh my, you are quite correct. Through rotations you would need your figure of 600,000 troops to be on tap. Can’t be done. I don’t think they would be interested and, as I’ve made clear, the Chinese don’t have the capability for force projection at that distance, let alone to Holland others/ Given that Ukraine cannot win, and that NATO cannot deliver enough people to be killed, it does seem like the real source of manpower would have to be “that country to the north of the Gulf of America” except that Zelensky must also know it’s never gonna happen. So this begins to look more like a desperate attempt to simply keep the gravy train war going. The Ukraine side of this conflict is beginning to remind me of that old Star Trek episode A Taste of Armageddon, in which two planets are fighting a centuries-long war entirely using computers, except that to keep score for the computers, their citizens were obliged to report to “disintegration chambers” in which they would be killed. The Enterprise crew gets caught in the crossfire, so to speak, are captured and being pushed to die in said disintegration chambers, basically in order to keep the “normalized” computer war going and thereby avoid a “real” war. Some eerie parallels here, as the larger narrative is that NATO+US should perform some “duty” to die in the Ukraine (instead of Ukrainian soldiers, to avoid demographic disaster you know), in order to somehow prevail and prevent a larger more “real” war with Russia. It’s just bonkers. I am Nomad …speaking for all Americans So that’s where you deport all those illegals too? I expect that my slow the flow at the border… Bonkers, yes. Trump may seem ridiculous with his Gulf of America but it’s a harmless bonkers so far. That other bonkers is proving horribly deadly. Why is Gulf of America bonkers? To the north of it is North America, to the south of it is South America and it’s also surrounded by Central America and Latin America. Gulf of America seems pretty harmless while not being an actual overreach. Of course when I first heard the idea I was outraged… But then after sleep I saw the sense of it, and the harmlessness. Throw the US a bone, I say As a map person I’m not particularly in favor of presidents renaming stuff. But of course the Dems have been doing it too. There has been some commentary that all the legally dubious outside the box moves by the Dems are going to come back at them from their supposed opponents. Our entire ruling class may have way too much time on their hands. I don’t know about that. Acquiesce quietly to the Gulf of America in order to avoid a stupid and pointless fight and I fear that the next thing you know they’ll be demanding that the Pacific and the Atlantic be renamed as the Oceans of America East & West. How about Gulf of the Americas or if we really want to rub it in we could call it, in honor of our declaration of hemispheric hegemonism, the Gulf of Monroe Or just Marilyn… The Gulf of Mexico was named by Spanish explorers in the 16th Century. They claimed much of the adjacent coastline for Spain. In fact, Spain claimed much of what became Mexico and (Alta California); until the Mexican revolution in 1821. Much of the northern portions of Mexico were invaded by the US Army in 1846 and made Territory’s of the US;later became the states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California (Baja excepted). So, since most of the Gulf coastline is adjacent to Mexico and Cuba, the name is appropriate. Throw the US a hand granade, I say I’ve proposed that just the Dead Zone be renamed Gulf of America. I don’t believe that Trump has any authority to rename the Gulf of Mexico. Those are international waters. He may as well try renaming the Barents Sea. What he is trying to do is far from harmless. It is imperial overreach at its very worst. Cartographers should tell Trump to take a hike – down the Orient Express on Denali. Put them in Poland! BTW Zelinskyy is as legitimate a “leader” as any of the puppets US put in Saigon. during that long ago quagmire “Zelensky demands at least 200,000 ‘peacekeepers’ on Ukrainian soil – Reuters” And I want a pony Since this talk of 200,000 peace keepers is a steaming heap of horse manure, dig in. There has to be a pony in there. Early 1945 talk of folly: Imaginary Divisions Early 2025 talk of folly: Imaginary Divisions Once again the 4th turning shows up~ I believe most, if not all, African states have taken a neutral position on the Russo-Borderlands war so presumably the ideal peacekeeping force will consist of 200,000 troops from sub-Saharan Africa. They’ll just love the winters. Is there any official list or source with the real number of troops. Just as you describe it for GB? Out of those 184,860 90% would be dead immediately in case of real war. It’s the well-known NATO paper tiger. But people ask me where do you take your numbers from. Of course, how do you prove that NATO troops are not fit for combat if there is no war. How do you prove the negative? That’s a hard sell in any debate. And that will take off now all over EU. p.s. Of course you can reference the US studies like in Parameter Magazine but that is American and very specific. And you can now prove that NATO tanks are firecrackers but that too needed over a year of negative news slipping through. Additionally to the pre-existing scattered reports about Leopards failing in Syria and Kurdistan which were buried very very deep. >Guillotine Watch It’s going to be very interesting to see if a Nation/regime that attempted to purge billionaire oligarchs from having control over public/foreign policy (Russia/Putin) will trump a Nation/regime that hands over public/foreign policy to them (Trump/Elon, et al). Yes, the China gambit of AI as a public utility is interesting in this regard. To the extent States outside the Oligarchy normalize the IT of the last 40 years as public utilities, capturing the benefits of the tech for the public, many things start looking like Chinese solar & EVs where they have a clear “unfair” advantage from not drowning their productive class in rents. To actually be competitive, Trump should be thinking about the propensity of Chinese billionaires to fall off cliffs and that sort of thing. Instead, he appears to be becoming the “Grifter in Chief”. jsn: To the extent States outside the Oligarchy normalize the IT of the last 40 years as public utilities, capturing the benefits of the tech for the public, many things start looking like Chinese solar & EVs where they have a clear “unfair” advantage Exactly so. You point out what will likely be one of the — maybe the — dominant geopolitical trends of the next few decades. At least if we’re fortunate. So, the CIA will be using AI trained on massive amounts of propaganda to predict the behavior of world leaders. That should go well: “PutinBot, what are your plans for the next few years?” “Well, I plan to eat a bunch of babies, then re-take Alaska. Then, I’ll either die of cancer or poison Ameirica’s water supply to sap and impunity all of their precious bodily fluids; I don’t know which.” You think that the CIA built themselves a TrumpBot to try to predict his actions if he was re-elected as President? Good luck with that one. But this article did finish on a bizarre note. So the CIA is going to bring in Silicon Valley to help drive their culture. Really? Sure they have been joined at the hip since the early days but is the CIA ready for that level of ruthlessness and urge for world dominance? The first thing that comes to mind re what SV has that the CIA doesn’t is massive, obscene payoffs for the winners of the greasy pole competition, so maybe they have a point? Not a good one, but in this timeline it almost makes a perverted sense. Don’t forget that he (Putin), is going to corner the market of washing machines so they have a guaranteed supply of chips for missiles. “PutinBot, can you tell me how effective American sanctions are against Russia?” “PutinBot, can you tell me in step-wise detail how Americans can win in the Ukraine?” “PutinBot, can you tell me where i can find 200,000 able-bodied men to die in Ukraine?” Ding Ding! You win the internet today. “India Set to Take Back 18,000 Citizens From US to Placate Trump” India is not worried by this development at all. As soon as those 18,000 Indians are back home, the Indian government will have them apply for H-1B visas and before you know it, they will be back again but legally this time. And they know that Vivek will always have their back. Re: WHO to lose 1/5 of its budget. Good. No more US influence. I know. Queen Ursula probably still has a contract with Pfizer.

WHO soon to be World Helots Organization? court rejected the complaint against her re: Pfizer sms I understand that as the US has already paid their dues, that they will still be in the WHO for this year. Meryl Nass has followed all the issues around the WHO, the treaty, etc. very closely. Here’s her rundown on the issues as they stand. MSM is full of errors about the WHO withdrawal, so I will correct them. https://merylnass.substack.com/p/msm-is-full-of-errors-about-the-who (The MSM is full of errors? Can it be? / ;) Thanks. I did not follow the MPox outbreaks carefully at the time. Is Nass’s point #8 correct? The WHO should not be managing international outbreaks, after its well-publicized delays and failures with the 2 largest Ebola epidemics in Africa, and what I would call its ridiculous performance over monkeypox, twice declaring it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. What we need to get rid of is politicized healthcare, and the WHO represents all that is wrong with centralized medical decision making. I am not sure that there are not mistakes in the Nass piece. There is no mention I have found in the WHO Constitution of countries having a right to leave the organisation. IIRC when Warsaw Pact countries sent in their resignations in the 1950s they were not accepted. There may have been resolutions in the US Congress that the US should give a year’s notice if it wished to leave the WHO, but as there is no mention I can see of this in the text of WHO’s Constitution, I suspect the WHO will take the view that US legislation has no jurisdiction over their decisions. Happy to be corrected! It is always dangerous to ‘correct’ other people on the Internet. Are there any international lawyers in the building? 1948. US Code: §290c. Withdrawal from Organization on one-year notice In adopting this subchapter the Congress does so with the understanding that, in the absence of any provision in the World Health Organization Constitution for withdrawal from the Organization, the United States reserves its right to withdraw from the Organization on a one-year notice: Provided, however, That the financial obligations of the United States to the Organization shall be met in full for the Organization’s current fiscal year. (June 14, 1948, ch. 469, §4, 62 Stat. 442 .) https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:22%20section:290c%20edition:prelim) WHO recognizes the US 2025 withdrawal: WHO comments on United States’ announcement of intent to withdraw https://www.who.int/news/item/21-01-2025-who-comments-on-united-states–announcement-of-intent-to-withdraw Adding, the withdrawal is not a claim over the WHO’s future decisions. It is only divorcing from the WHO’s claims over any future US medical decisions, imo adding: The US Congress passed the signatory treaty only on condition of this exception. It still holds. The Warsaw Pact countries may not have made similar conditions to their signing the treaty in 1948. IANAIL, but Art 56 of the Vienna Convention on Treaties basically says that if a Treaty has no withdrawal provision, states can only withdraw if either the provision should have been included but wasn’t, or if the right to withdraw is somehow implicit in the text (which I don’t think it is. I suspect that in practice, and because the WHO is a subsidiary organ of the UN, it never crossed the minds of the drafters that someone might want to withdraw. Well, you may be right about the Vienna Convention. However, USians being a somewhat stubborn and shrewd lot, imo, ( certainly in 1948 after another ‘great war’), have in Constitutional law the US condition for treaty acceptance, which must be approved by Congress with any provisos the Congress may impose. That is the law of the US. In the US and the WHO case, US law at time of signing prevails. And I thank you for your question and research. It’s an important point. Is that the Meryl Nance of the Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccination group? Shooting the messenger? ;) Ad Hom much? I had not considered that. :) Thierrey Breton formerly EU now Bank of America Revolving Wall Street door threatens EU sovereignty By Thomas Fazi https://unherd.com/newsroom/revolving-wall-street-door-threatens-eu-sovereignty/ Add in there Merz (CDU/CSU) Blackrock to Germany PM… guess which company will buy all those deserted industrial estates. “Germany PM” the asshole is not there yet… p.s. but the Blackrock prediction would become true even without Merz Trump and CDC. This article provides a bit more context “Two others suggested the move is aimed at helping the newly installed Trump health officials understand the vast flow of information coming out of the health agencies. The pause, according to one official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal agency conversations, “seemed more about letting them catch their breath and know what is going on with regard to” communications. If the communications pause lasts more than a week or two, it could become concerning, that official said, noting that under the Biden administration, White House and HHS officials extensively reviewed material related to the coronavirus before it was released.” https://www.msn.com/en-us/politics/government/trump-officials-pause-health-agencies-communications-citing-review/ar-AA1xCis1 Platforming Moon of Alabama’s ignorant anti-DEI and anti-trans views? Gross. DEI seems like a jobs program for college grad aspiring PMC managers who need more things to manage. The US seems to have a surfeit of aspiring PMC wannabes. / ;) Wait. Are you saying that the Professional Managerial Class is not really the problem but the surfeit number of kids of the Professional Managerial Class trying to hustle themselves some new, made-up bs jobs? :) Why, whatever gives you that idea? / ;) It’s not the kids, it’s been going on for decades. Hiding behind the overtly racist and sexist reasoning of most anti-wokers, you can see glimmerings that some are starting to understand this is the real issue. The problem is not important jobs being filled by non-meritocratic means; the problem is the jobs themselves are BS sinecures that add costs with no benefits, and a secondary problem is that right-wingers are disqualified by ideology from getting most such sinecures so they have no incentive to go along. The scramble for jobs is just that tight. The economy and opportunities are just that bad. But instead of working against monopoly and Wall St powers, working for increased minimum wages, working against offshoring and open borders(increasing competition for entry level jobs,working for universal healthcare and the like, the Woke like the Moral Majority before it makes no economic class claims; it only fights for a bigger piece of an ever shrinking middle class slice of the pie. It is no threat at all to the ever increasing wealth and power of the richest and of Wall St. In that sense it is a distraction from the real economic problems most face. In fact, it gained its biggest jump in public awareness, via the MSM, after O bailed out the TBTF banks and the Occupy Wall St movement. It was as if a memo went out saying “Must change subject from bad bank financial behavior to bad middle class social behavior.” It’s a distraction from the big fight, imo. Seems like it worked, too. / my 2 cents Divide and conquer is an old idea. To quote Gilded Age robber baron Jay Gould: I Can Hire Half the Working Class To Fight the Other Half You have just made an excellent argument for a Vanguard of the Deplorables. Someone has to pick up that pointy ended stick (power) lying in the street and face it in the right direction. Peter Turchin would like to say some words about that. Elite oversupply, etc. You mean like “Chief People Officer”? DEI should be umbrellaed within Creative Writing departments where future baristas congregate. On the opposite end of DEI is the enduring belief in meritocratic hiring practices which in it’s own right is nonsence as well. As one of those evil PMC types, Ive found that the DEI messaging can be counterproductive in how it tends to be framed but all the teeth grinding about it comes off as nothing but coping from people who expected the world to be handed to them. Thanks. Good point about opposite ends of the stick. I’d say messaging can be counterproductive in how it tends to be framed can be applied to both ends. Nonsensical applications is our default setting. Not disagreeing with you point. Only pointing out the origin of merit hiring was a big push by good government reformers – the so-called goo-goos . It was their efforts to cleanup graft, influence peddling, and the patronage hiring systems in local, state, and federal employment; it was their effort to hire people competent and qualified for the job without regard to a job seeker’s party affiliation or family or business connections. Some states, including my own, were still using the patronage system for big state govt entities into the 1950s. And of course later, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, (EEOC) included in the 1964 Civil Rights Act was created, expanding the scope of merit hiring. “The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in a broad array of private conduct including public accommodations, governmental services and education. One section of the Act, referred to as Title VII, prohibits employment discrimination based on race, sex, color, religion and national origin. Title VII applies to private employers, labor unions and employment agencies. The Act prohibits discrimination in recruitment, hiring, wages, assignment, promotions, benefits, discipline, discharge, layoffs and almost every aspect of employment.” The issue I have with DEI is that it is missing the letter “C” (Competence.) All the diversity, equity, and inclusion available does not making for a functioning organization, if they don’t have relevant capability. (And I mean ‘capability’ not ‘credential’.) I can’t recall the author – there was a blogosphere post a while back that made an argument that the biggest issue facing the West was overproduction of elites. Peter Turchin is considered the current shepherd of that longstanding idea. His most recent book was reviewed a number of places including here. The Donkey Show banked on a tiny percent of the population being trans being so important that it became all encompassing, or in essence they couldn’t read the room, and then came the broom. It could have be any other wedge issue. Abortion worked for 50 years and #metoo had its time in the sun. If the population ever comes to some sort of agreement in how to deal with transpeople in public, they’ll just put in something else. Maybe polygamists or people who always wear people will be next in line. What’s important is keeping the masses divided and having each other. “… people who always wear people will…” We’re well into ‘Eyes Wide Shut’ territory here. No matter how cynical you are, you are always behind the curve. Major autocorrect snafus by meeee! Could be the next wedge issue – should people practicing terrible grammar online be shunt off in padded cells with very poor cell signal? Should pedantic individuals be a hunted class for HTS snuff videos? Should we all get AI brain implants? Will future wars be fight between people wearing people and people wearing cats? Will the people wearing skunks win? Fear not. There will not be a supply issue concerning “canon fooder” for as long as the population exceeds the dreams of glory of alpha type personalities. Pompous prolix pedants are a credit a dyad. My best guess is that “Online Grammer and Correct Content” will be a part of the curriculum in the FEMA Re-education Centres. I rather like “canon fodder.” DEI is pro segregation. All those racial affinity groups make me sick. Go ask my dad about the affinity bathrooms, affinity water fountains, and affinity schools from his youth in the south. Same thing, different era. More Moon of Alabama please, and less wokie wokism. As Emma pointed out above, identity politics is pro-segregation. The natural result its weaponization is an overweight backlash. This cycle kills any chance of society gaining a beneficial outcome. Using the theory that laws are tools of social engineering, we must ask ourselves, what purposes are the “woke” class of laws intended to promote? Per the above, positing conspiracies for social trends is overly reductionist. Since most social “movements” are the results of one form of a congruence of interests or another, we can somewhat simplify the problem by investigating the milieus from which the impetuses that “power” the ‘movements’ arise. As always, ‘who benefits’ is the primary question. …which would be the consultant class within the booming industry of “elections”. Thanks. Just another way of catering to the 1%. Big profit center. To me, the whole point of the links is to present viewpoints as diverse as the Kyiv Independent to the Valdai book club. If someone wants a safe news feed that just confirms their viewpoints, get a Facebook account. Sorry if that sounded snotty, but your comment was out of line. And that is from someone totally agnostic on DEI matters. It will be a long 4 years! And it didn’t happen soon enough :-) I disagree with it too but Bernard at MoA is good on a lot of foreign policy and military stuff and that’s where he’s coming from. My personal view is D and I are important. We can work on that as eyes open thinking human beings, without getting it hammered into our brains by a staff of 200 headed up by some PhD in gender studies who got a sinecure. E is a cruel joke meant to fog our brains so we ignore getting screwed over by the 1% and its running dogs. None of those letters deserve a senior manager assignment, less a whole department. While we’re at it, let’s get rid of the real baddies – HR! Hedges had this interview with Christian Parenti on woke in general as a problem for academia (as he sees it.) It’s not entirely DEI – but was a bit related I think Sept. 25th 2024 How Wokeness Kills Class Politics and Empowers Empire (w/ Christian Parenti) | The Chris Hedges Report https://chrishedges.substack.com/p/how-wokeness-kills-class-politics The problem with DEI: it´s too complex a scientific matter to give it a general all/nothing treatment. It already starts with the complex biological realities, realities which are scientific facts vs. social realities and the creation of laws and regulations which have to simplify. Yes, I put that up to provoke people just like you, trans advocates who have no problem with running roughshod over women’s rights. As a woman, I am not on board with people with penises in women’s bathrooms. Nor am I on board with people with XY chromosomes competing in women’s sports. People with XY chromosomes, even if they take hormone-suppressive drugs early, have higher levels of muscle mass, sturdier bones, and less joint laxity than XX people, giving them an unfair advantage in sports. Women fought too hard over generations for safe spaces and their own sports to have a tiny minority of trans trample over them. Hear, hear, Yves. Absolutely. >>I am not on board with people with penises in women’s bathrooms. Not just trans women, but women with a “mannish” appearance are going to be facing a rough time… No, manish doesn’t cut it. That doesn’t matter. There are many “dykes” who are still women, though they make great Tom Boys. Can’t tell a book by looking at the cover. I read a list of track and field records. By age 15, boys outperformed *adult* women in all categories. No trans men in women’s sports. Let us not pretend that there are no genetically determined biological differences between the sexes, particular as regards relative physical strength coupled with a greater propensity for physical aggression, such that there are no venues such as women’s sports, prisons, and safe houses, where the exclusion of biological males is not warranted. I have an idea. Let’s have an all female plebiscite to decide such questions, including trans women if you like, and let the women decide. Take rowing for example. An elite male rower will be 6-6 tall, 210 pounds, and will pull a time of 5.45 on an ergometer for a 2000 meter distance. An elite woman will be 6-1 or 6-2, 170 pounds, and will pull a time of 6.30 on an ergometer, nearly a minute slower. Men are bigger, stronger, and faster, period. On average! In classes as big as men and women, the difference within a class are greater than the differences between the classes. So there will be individual cases otherwise But yes, that average difference is why women are indoctrinated to be submissive and manipulative, since on average, if a woman physically confronts a man, she will get the shit beaten out of her. That happens to ‘skinny guys’, as well, in America. Talented comedians are ‘short’ because they have a lifetime of experience avoiding this ‘danger’. YMMV ;) Height-challenged male here, who was very mouthy as a youth. The sport of wrestling was a safe way to take out all my anger, as they classed us by weight! Didn’t say short guys are quiet. Comedians are quite fascile with language and use it to defang big guys. There are no weight classification on ‘the street’. :) on average, if a woman physically confronts a man, she will get the shit beaten out of her. . . Unless her name is Dakota Ditcheva. https://news.cgtn.com/news/2025-01-22/Per-capita-income-in-rural-Xizang-nears-national-level-in-2024-1An2VDnVMmA/p.html January 22, 2025 Per capita income in rural Xizang nears national level in 2024 The per capita disposable income of rural residents in southwest China’s Xizang Autonomous Region saw the fastest growth in the country in 2024, nearing the national average, a remarkable accomplishment considering the region’s challenging plateau conditions. During the year, the per capita disposable income of rural residents in the region was 21,578 yuan (about $3,010), reaching 93.3 percent of the national average level, Li Jianshu, deputy head of the Xizang survey team at the National Bureau of Statistics, said at a press conference held during the annual session of the regional people’s congress concluding on Wednesday. The figure marked an 8.3-percent increase from the previous year, 1.7 percentage points higher than the national average growth rate, Li said. He further noted that the per capita disposable income of urban residents reached 55,444 yuan, up 6.8 percent, 2.2 percentage points higher than the national average growth rate. The per capita disposable income of all residents in the region surged by 8.2 percent to 31,358 yuan. This growth rate, the highest among the country’s provincial-level areas, exceeded the national average by 2.9 percentage points. Mountain-locked Xizang was once the only provincial-level contiguous poverty-stricken region in China, burdened by its high altitude, harsh environment, poor transportation and limited resources. By the end of 2019, however, the region achieved a historic feat by eradicating absolute poverty, lifting 628,000 people out of poverty. Thanks to the development of infrastructure, the booming tourism market, and the accelerated growth of various industries in the region, the income structure of residents in Xizang has greatly improved, leading to enhanced living standards for its people. By the end of 2019, however, the region achieved a historic feat by eradicating absolute poverty, lifting 628,000 people out of poverty. Thanks to the development of infrastructure… Amazing. But if you listen to John Stewart, there is a trade-off between “developing Infrastructure” and modernizing public transportation such as NY subways, and that trade-off is our “freedom.” the region achieved a historic feat by eradicating absolute poverty, lifting 628,000 people out of poverty… …but at what cost? Thanks. I particularly enjoyed the header China helping the world is suspicious. “Orwellian” may be tired terminology, but from my perspective…… level of irrelevancy Stewart has sunk to makes road-kill more important – he’s acting punch-drunk now – first Apple beat him up, then called on the carpet for his Wuhan moment on Colbert – now he’s a palooka taking dives – “I could have been a contender” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z66hw6q-zY&t=27s Just when you thought the numismatrix couldn’t get any more silly, the race to out meme one another in matters of cryptocurrency raised it up another notch. Let’s talk ramifications of the eventual reckoning sure to come? We didn’t hear a peep about crypto out of Genocide Joe, but Trump hit the ground running, and he’s an outlier in that it’s a young persons’ Mug’s Game-not something Gen X or Boomers are all that interested in. When they get burned (3rd degree at a minimum, possibly 4th degree lesions) young adult males are gonna be hopping mad, and how do they react? and how do they react? Something tells me it could involve firearms. The AR-15 type has been a popular choice (e.g., Thomas Crooks, Kyle Rittenhouse, et alia), and the vegan activist woman who shot up the YouTube HQ in California (she had been deplatformed) used a 9 mm Smith & Wesson semi-automatic pistol, but post-Luigi a 3D-printed “ghost gun” is probably the go-to. How do they react? The likely reaction is verbal and actual violence against the weak, also likely preceded by some kind of Immigrant Shock Horror-type news panic or its equivalent… People are transfixed by their dis-infotainment of choice, and too cowardly to go after the actual sources of their suffering, even if they know what it is. Breaking out of that neoliberal fugue state, which requires the quiet and honest introspection that this society is threatened by/incapable of (regardless of political affiliation), seems increasingly remote. As I opined above, the present situation is crying out for a ‘Vanguard of the Deplorables.’ In a less socially retarded society, these silly things like meme coins would not be banned but would be properly classified as gambling. Because there is no utility to $TRUMP or $DOGE we would see them treated like sports betting. Most states now allow sports betting, hence the cottage industry of web sites like Fan Duel, and the NFL embracing gambling on games and not just in Vegas. The past few days have me so excited. Sam Altman, Trump and AI are going to cure cancer…right after the Trump admin retakes the Panama Canal and goes to Mars. My question: will it all get done in the first 100 days? Golden Age in ‘Murca! Does that mean we all better buy gold because it’s all going to sh-t? The customers are usually none too happy when a salesman way oversells the product. Trump appears to be an accelerationist’s dream. Trump appears to be an accelerationist’s dream. “Throw another tire on the fire….”, (some Cohen Bros movie, I think is where I got that) Here’s hoping “acceleration” is not ’25’s word of the year. Buy gold? Too late, CostCo is already sold out! >The Black Book of Communism Is a Shoddy Work of History The British Conservative politician Daniel Hannan had a similar message as he prepared for “the most monstrous of centenaries.” According to Hannan, communism was far worse than slavery or Nazism: “The Atlantic slave trade killed perhaps 10 million people, the Nazis 17 million — but the Communists killed 100 million.” The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, which runs a museum in Washington, carries the following message on its website: “Communism Killed Over 100 Million: We’re telling their stories.” If we judge by the number of victims, the worst ideology must be capitalism. That is a lot of statistics. Fauci asking when his contributions to world health will get a mention? The industrial era has been far more about capitalism than communism so surely a Black Book of Capitalism is in order. In fact the Russian Revolution was in many ways a result of WW1 and WW2 in turn a result of that. And in any case pretending our social life is all about political/economic theories is dubious since wars and victims have been a feature long preceding the ideologies. It is interesting how all the many horrors of capitalism going back to the British and Dutch East India Companies, the Atlantic slave trade, the King Leopold’s Belgian Congo, several large famines in the British Empire, plus much else in the more than four centuries of its existence. Heck, many of the coups done by the United States were and are done for the benefit and often direct requests of corporations. Proponents of capitalism want to look only at the benefits, which often are very large, of capitalism without looking at the extremely high costs of it, which is dishonest. “surely a Black Book of Capitalism is in order” It exists: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzbuch_Kapitalismus although Kurz would have preferred to call it ‘The Mills of Satan’ (Die Mühlen des Teufels), in reference to Blake, but the publisher wanted the title for sales reasons. You can download it by searching: Robert Kurz Schwarzbuch Kapitalismus – exit-online.org Communism and capitalism are different flavors of extractive profit economies. The root problem is that in all those societies, a few people ruled over everyone else, imposing law and choosing how to enforce. Same problem in America, Soviet Union, Great Britain, China. No wonder they all have histories of huge amounts of death and exploitation – they’re different flavors of the same underlying problem, where a few people rule over everyone else. All of them forbid people from taking responsibility for their culture and standing up to abuse, because that’s supposedly the police’s job, and they’re not allowed to do their job – honest police, known as whistleblowers, don’t last long in any unhealthy culture. There are actual human societies with a gift economy – that is, economies that reward sharing rather than profiting, and the highest leaders are the ones that share and give the most, rather than elevating the richest or the servants of the rich, as happens in America, China, Russia, etc. If you want an alternative to the tired debates between communism, capitalism, and socialism, I suggest looking at these gift economies. A book called One Disease One Cure goes into all this with many beautiful stories, exploring how people can live in respectful ways, and all the usual trouble that happens when a few people rule over everyone else. Not only that it is way far ahead, but is still counting. P.S. The Nazis killed 17 million, out of which 27 millions of Soviets. art history/ painting “On T. J. Clark’s Bruegel” by Daniel Zamora https://newleftreview.org/sidecar/posts/world-upside-down Thanks – excellent commentary and review. I’ve been going up to Belgium and Holland for a week each summer trying to see as many of these places that are around and the paintings when they happen to have stayed there! It’s sort of sad that there are no Bosch paintings in Den Bosch… ‘Why you should have a cat @ShouldHaveCat Teacher teaching his student’ Yeah, not a good idea this. You don’t want to accidentally hit your cat and get in a fight with it. That never ends well- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMHkQDzt8VM (2:12 mins) Will Stargate Project be $20 billion for running Deepseek algorithm and $480 billion for “miscellaneous”? That could be a job for the new DOGE – to investigate the people in the Stargate Project. Yeah, right. But the name of that project could be apt. You fire up that Stargate, threw billions into that event horizon, and then you shut it down with no trace of those billions left behind- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8j9Fl34RAU (1:00 mins) According to Musk, neither. https://www.politico.eu/article/us-elon-musk-troll-donald-trump-500b-ai-plan/ Suggestion for miscellaneous: – buy Uber, and rename it to Uber Alles I’m reading in Canadian news that Trump’s executive order reversing DEI targeted and reversed Lyndon Johnson’s executive order 11246 ending discrimination on the basis of race in federal government. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11246 Sounds about right. But possibly a happy accident. Like when a cat goes to knock one thing off the counter, but also knocks over another thing that’s even more fun! Haven’t heard anything, yet, from Canadians, about Trump pardoning Proud Boys who are terrorist in Canada, and some other countries. An obvious question is what are the odds Trump will also go after the Civil Rights Act? It seems like a logical next step. These days many seem to equate DEI with anti-white discrimination (which it is decidedly not but facts and truth are irrelevant). And with this move rescinding EO 11246 as part of anti-DEI, Trump is equating the civil rights movement with DEI and with anti-white discrimination, which his administration wants to reverse in all shapes and forms, real or imagined. PLAAF has a sixth generation fighter type aircraft! They will probably build a few dozen and test around them. While the Lockheed is building more aircraft for the dividend flow. Every new F-35, and all those tooling about out in the world, needs a new engine which is not in anyone’s plan! “There’s reason to be worried about the plethora of pardons from Trump and Biden” Politico would never mention it but there is a qualitative difference between Biden’s pardons and Trumps. With Biden he was pardoning his own (crime) family because of all the corruption that they are involved in, political operatives like Milley, the Jan. 6 committee and Fauci to buy their silence and in fact more pardons than any President in history by a long shot. Trump pardoning those protestors was not in the same class. The full might and weight of the US was used like a bludgeon to go after anybody there that day. People who walked quietly through an escort of police, looked at the interiors, took a few selfies, and then left were facing charges that would lead to years in prison. It was gross and needed correcting. Maybe not all of them should have been released but it was the fastest way to do it. Would you believe on the news they claimed that a police officer died that day? Some people died that day and one was murdered but none of them were police. US’ left wing pundits continue to proclaim the Jan 6th political prisoners as attackers. They may have frightened the democrats over the vote fraud, but they deserved a hearing denied them. The issue is that democrats ran Maoist show trials. Pardons merely reverse their crimes against US citizens rights. The continued drivel on the news is boring There had already been over 60 state and federal lawsuits, hearings and investigations by state government and election officials, manual full and partial recounts, and audits, the process and results of which were open to the public. The Capitol rioters may have been there to protest the fact that their preferred candidate wouldn’t be president despite having lost the election, but the “hearing” on this had already occurred. I will also point out that long after the Capitol riot the “hearing” continued with additional investigations including one initiated by the Trump administration, public scrutiny, lawsuits, and at least one full manual recount organized and funded by Republican supporters. That is why Schiff and Cheney need pardons. Ford lost to Carter for using the Pardon power as a get out of jail free card for Nixon. Having re-purposed DoJ for Lawfare, the Ds are now using Pardons as get out of jail free cards at scale. I agree, what Trump did he did for people not tied directly to his own corruption, while Biden is in full get out of jail free mode. Not to suggest Trumps memecoin and innumerable other activities aren’t corrupt, but he’s been playing the legalized crime game his whole life and as such has other buffers for his surrogates. Whenever I read an article that uses the term “debunked” I immediately assume that there is some truth in what they claim is “debunked”. The Raw Story article a case in point – they claim Jim Jordan is still pursuing “debunked” Jan 6 theories – so I figure Jordan is on the right track. – ‘Stefanik paints a grim picture of a UN she wants to reform’ – Politico Stefanik is about as miserable a candidate for our “top diplomat” as one could find, but she follows a long line of these. No surprise here. But what has struck me about her confirmation is the bipartisan support for her confirmation. As this Political article points out: “The moderate Republican turned ardent Trump backer is generally expected to be easily confirmed and without much serious opposition from Senate Democrats who see her as less polemical than other nominees and broadly agree with her on the need to support Israel.” In addition to fighting the Chinese take-over of the UN, Stefanik has pledged to dig out it’s “antisemitic rot.” She also agreed with Smotrich and Ben Givr that Israel has “a biblical right to the entire West Bank.” I’m glad Trump could find a “less polemical” candidate for UN Ambassador. No need for Senate Democrats to slow-walk her confirmation. She’s ready to go! Are you sure she does not think she is being appointed Secretary General? Worse than Bolton? More or less effective? We’ve been sending our worst for decades now. We can all look forward to Rhianna pulling her security detail in 2035. She has some major Upper Class pull, along with the Harvard pedigree and I’ve heard people speculate that this is going to be her foreign policy training, setting her up for a run for POTUS. Her TV stylist has been upping her game over the past year too. I wonder if Trump ordered that, it would be in character. She could have been defeated early. She’s a perfect empty vessel, now battle tested and ready for action “Acceleration, Decapitation, Mobilization” **** At some point (except mobilization) this will make sense. Maybe soon, if the Donbass fronts reach the point of collapse of Ukraine forces on a bigger scale. Trump’s recent comments these past few days show he is just as out of touch and misinformed as his predissors regarding the war in Ukraine – saying Russia has lost “a million men” (and Ukraine much less) its economy is hurting and declining and the war is not going well for Russia and Putin needs to stop the war for domestic and other reasons and needs to get Western sanctions relief. Putin and Russian establishment have repeatedly said Zelensky is not the legitimate President of Ukraine. So what is he? The West will never allow Russia to “win the peace” until all current EU leaders are regime changed. So IMO, as Ukraine collapses, they will work with what remains of Ukraine to turn it into a type of terrorist launching pad to inflict whatever damage on Russia that they are able. At some point, Russia will need to fix her mistake of normalizing direct attacks by the West upon her. The time for Russia to accelerate (and maybe decapitate) may be approaching. But then what do I know? The West will never allow Russia to “win the peace” until all current EU leaders are regime changed. Biden is gone, Trudeau is gone in a few weeks, Sholz is gone in a few weeks, Starmer is not looking all that good, Orban and Fico would be happy to be out of it as, I think, will Meloni. Macron is looking crippled. I think major support is melting fast. I am not so sure about NATO resolve. “Following Trump’s lead, Lorenzo Sewell, a Detroit pastor who spoke during the president’s inauguration, announced the launch of his own memecoin later that day.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1jKMjOjg1M&ab_channel=M1/ Richard Pryor Show 1977 – Rev James L White , Who Reminds us of Daddy Rich; God & Federal Green! Pryor was great…Rev Sewell was such an embarrassment to MLK tradition. I can only imagine what some Baptist or other Southern Christian American/black people felt by imagining a NY Italian with his shirt open to his belly button and gold chains around his hairy chest coming out and representing Italian culture. The song in the clip says it all. In one of Richard Pryor’s movies he is an onlooker to a financial huckster promoting some scheme. The Pryor character raises his voice and says that “this looks like a pyramid scheme” . The promoter responds with, “no, no, it’s a trapezoidal scheme”. We need more comedians and the media taking on the financial and political schemers of USA society. But I fear it’s “not gonna happen” “Which Way Is Up” and “Blue Collar” – notable Pryor films about the working class vs “the system”. LOL, I remember that scene. He even shows on the board. its after 9am here, still 19 degrees, with a vigorous southwest wind and windchill around 4 or 5. but itll get up to 55 today, they say…. so’s i can turn on the water, again. let all the birds out for the first time since friday…stupified, blinking in the sun. sheeps reckon they should continue getting fed twice a day. i ended up going forth and cutting more wood at the woodshed, and down there at one of the dead trees along the fenceline in the front pasture. just to keep things running smoothly. still waiting for a part for the woodstove in my room…and man have i missed it. bored out of my mind…sore from laying around under covers in far too many layers of clothes, watching tv. greenhouse toms and peppers made it just fine…because i’m a bad mofo. and have slept for 2 or 3 hours at a time throughout. now, with the sun well up, greenhouse is the place to be…about 65, right now…didnt let it get below 40. plants are rather thirsty, tho. and i smell like a goat…really look forward to a superhot bath this evening, after critters are done….espsom salts, dishsoap and prolly some rosemary tossed in…the big tankless set to 125…then the little booster tankless in greenhouse helping it along…end result is a bath of around 114 by the time i get in it….eureka!, and all. likely make a beer run, since the kegstand is unlikely to thaw in time,lol. and laundry manana afternoon, when it heats up again…and i suppose dishes at some point. it’ll be almost 70 degrees by sunday, they say. one of my superpowers…i endure things…and i endured this. doesnt mean i hafta like it. nebraska can keep their frelling winter weather.

Speaking of the cold, and sorry to change the subject, but this is nuts. I live in a small NW Ohio town. It was below zero last night, and in the single digits for the last few days. There is a young adult girl who lives with her mother in an apartment complex. According to the neighbor she has severe anxiety and claustrophobic characteristics, so she doesn’t go inside. There is a picture of her laying on the front porch of her house with blankets over top of her. She was out there all night. A neighbor called the police and they said they couldn’t do anything. She also contacted a county commissioner. He hasn’t been able to do anything either. How can this happen? How can they allow this girl to lay out there and freeze to death. I don’t know if they even know if she’s alive? She is an adult so you can’t use child abuse angle (I guess, she does live with her mom). I honestly don’t know how this hasn’t went viral. Unbelievable. As an out-of-cert EMT in a 911 community (in a former life) we were able to request that patients be taken into custody if they were a danger to themselves or others. Usually drunks or homeless transients during cold weather. We would be called by the authorities to help make the determination. It’s a tough call. Sometimes, but seldom, appreciated. Thank you for this. I thought something like this is possible. Tough call – no doubt – but it needs to be done. If I were a city council member, police, whoever, I would call for an emergency meeting and demand something be done – by someone. If you are out in these freezing temperatures you are in danger – period. It shouldn’t be difficult. Thanks for your input. I’ll put that task with Amforta’s cat responsibility as things I would not be good at. Swinging back on course, I figure there are a lot of plumbing issues in parts of the country that don’t normally get well below freezing temps. Here in the southern Greens of Vermont, today’s high is 12 and todays low is minus 12, which I woke up to. I got out of bed twice last night to stoke the wood stove. We did get eight inches of very high quality snow Sunday. yeah. we aint set up for this sort of thing. y’all got pipes buried deep, steep roofs, etc. and, using mom as a proxy, i guarantee that i’m likely the only one around here who preemptively shuts off my water and drains the system(built it that way)…because theres few things i dislike more than being a plumber in the mud when its in the 40’s and 50’s, with wind(we’re always windy out here). its also why i do woodstoves…i can burn pallets if i have to…or take the chainsaw to the side of the highway, for that matter. this year and last, ive had a giant pile of what used to be mom’s enormous 100+ year old pecan trees to work on…too big for me to cut up by myself, but eldest likes that sort of work. also have the biggest parts of one of neighbor’s standing dead oaks…4 more along his part of the road i can get whenever i need to. so i got wood…but since im usually on my own, im playing catchup with the cutting and splitting. even so, i dont hafta rely on $ for propane or electricity….save like right now, when one of the woodstoves is missing a part. “normally” we only get a few days like this per year…but its been weird since the 2 week ice age in feb 2021. ive only shut off my water twice, so far…but thats a lot compared to a “normal” winter. during feb 21, whole county lost power for a week…but we managed to keep this big old drafty thing above 40,lol. and used hurricane lamps, etc for light. i’m built for the heat. both me, myself, as well as my structures. give me 105 in the shade any old day. i could never live where some of yall do,lol. and when i’m out at dawn on mornings like this, in the wind, checking on things(another service i get no credit for, i might add)…i think about you folks in vermont, maine and ontario…let alone people i know in edmonton… up to almost 40, wind dyin down…so ima do my town run in a minute…and go cut some wood…then hopefully, the lowest faucet, which happens to be in deep shade on north side of house(had a heater on it for 2 hours) will thaw enough to close, so i can assess that situation,lol. barnyard is easier to turn back on for the same reason its the first i shut off…every faucet is in the open. amazingly, sheep still have water…deicers worked well…and they apparently arent that thirsty when its this cold. sigh. I got a blow dryer duct taped to a hockey stick. That and a couple of clamps for hands free pipe defrosting, heh heh. Not all pipes are deep in the ground. Five dollar propane here. Getting the truck up the drive is the hard part. You got a portable mill? Is pecan wood good for finishing work? Plus, you have oak. About the cold. I’d wager you’d enjoy it without the wind. I sat out last night once the thermometer cracked zero. Somehow the cold intensifies the silence. Downside was my beverage froze up pretty quick. if i have a good fire in the hole at the bar…where im somewhat sheltered from all but east or west wind…i can take it down to about 40…and thats with sufficient beer and/or whiskey, and 3 layrs plus 2 heavy bathrobes, plus furry hat. i read in SciAm some time ago that shivering is how one acclimates to the onset of cold season…trust the science, and all,lol…so ever since, in november, with the first real cold front, you’ll find me remaining nekkid out there…for as long as i can stand it…then layering up by the roaring inferno(old pallets are great for that) and making my way inside…where i will always have woodstoves, etc already doing their thing. again…i do not like the cold. november through february is my very least favorite part of the year. but that sciam method seems to work a bit, as i find i am a bit more cold tolerant than usual. as for today…and dreams of a superhot bath…well, god laughs at our plans. forgot to open one(1) faucet on my side of the system…the one that goes to the shed where W/D lives…and i dont feel like another trip to town.(pipedope mustve gotten cold, bc its all watery and useless…and i was sure i had another ball valve to patch that, but i dont) i want my 2 hours in the warm greenhouse with beer and a hogleg and art pepper and sunshine, ere i go forth and put up critters. still smell like a frelling goat,lol…but i got lotsa cornstarch, some real frankincense, and a nose full of snot anyways….ha!…something cedar fever is good for, at last! I always enjoy your checkins. Enjoy your bath! DEI or no DEI. DEI is segregation. Identity politics is a doorway to unequal outcomes. “Trans” is a tiny population exploded into a world shattering problem. Is any of this true? To what extent is it false? Now there is an executive order mandating two genders. There are two genders in the majority, but then there are those in between. If you treat them as “flyover country”, you can populate it with wonders and with monsters and never be the wiser. I used to drive from the east coast to western Montana each summer. I did so because I wanted to see what was there. I wanted to see who was there. No surprise that coastal and bi-coastal sophisticates were thin on the ground. And no surprise that the inhabitants of “flyover country” were much like those I had left behind. As Yves says, “Quelle surprise.” Whatever else DEI is or was, it became a bludgeon in the hands of people with a political agenda. I choose not to characterize that agenda except to say the bottom line is or was, “You will do it our way … or else. Or else you will suffer in a manner of our choosing.” Seemed a totalitarian’s way of thinking to me. Are there, were there those with motives of the greatest and most disinterested purity? I am sure there are and were, but they were either never in charge or lost control to the other crowd who found a vehicle for their fantasies of control. Is there a “moral to the story?” Not sure, but if there is I nominate always look at the places in between. If you treat them as “flyover country”, you can populate it with wonders and with monsters and never be the wiser. That’s a choice sentence and worth a think. Trump 2.0 An addition to this section of links. (Insert voice of Larry Cable Guy’s “git-r-done!”) So D-man’s placement speech wailed on about all sorts of inefficiencies and lack of gov’t’s abilities to confront crises at the homeland. To Angelino readers of NC, maybe one can pass along this bit of news to the new prez while he tours Calif and surveys the scene. Let him know if means to “git-r-done!”, well hands on deck sir. Since the new prez is keen on making schools great again, let not a moment pass when he can take some wind out of Newsom’s sails and announce a yuuge fed-led investment. or else, it’s just another brick let loose off the wall that is US infrastructure. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/la-schools-wrecked-fires-plead-162513682.html “[S]chool officials say they need more than anything else is cash to pay for new places to learn…They are turning to crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe to quickly raise money… Of the more than 15,400 structures wrecked by the Palisades and Eaton fires so far, at least 18 schools — including charter or private schools — have sustained significant damage or been destroyed, according to data from the California Department of Education and certain schools. While property insurance and government aid will help cover the cost to rebuild, that will take time that mid-year students can’t afford.” Re DeepSeek, here’s how it wraps up a response to “Tell me about Naked Capitalism.” Congrats to all on proper surfing of this eddy of the AI wave: Conclusion Naked Capitalism is a valuable resource for anyone interested in critical perspectives on finance, economics, and politics. Its commitment to independent journalism and its willingness to question mainstream narratives make it a standout in the world of financial blogging. If you’re looking for an alternative to traditional financial news outlets, Naked Capitalism is well worth exploring. “Chinese AI software DeepSeek was built at a fraction of the cost of American companies like Meta & OpenAI, but performs better. From the user perspective, DeepSeek is 96% cheaper than ChatGPT and other popular LLM.” Considering the Magnificent Seven Stocks and their prominence in the stock market indices and the gains in index funds, I wonder whether the news about the Chinese AI software DeepSeek might cause some disturbance of the AI frenzy pumping up the Magnificent Seven. While part of their value is the result of their control over key avenues of commerce, I suspect there might be some ‘fat’ in their present stock valuations. I asked DeepSeek to recommend some good independent news sources about the war in Ukraine. This is what came up with: 1. The Kyiv Independent 2. Meduza 3. The New Voice of Ukraine 4. Bellingcat 5. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) 6. The Insider 7. Ukrainska Pravda 8. OpenDemocracy 9. The Associated Press (AP) and Reuters 10. Local Independent Media in Ukraine (like Hromadske and Zaborona) That says a lot about their source of training data. You should ask recommendations for bad sources. Scholz at Davos: Europe Must Arm for War with Russia Will Scholz share his bomb shelter with all of us? It’s only fair. cupie doll: Will Scholz share his bomb shelter with all of us? You wouldn’t want Scholz to share his shelter because you wouldn’t want to be in it with him when an Oreshnik comes calling once he and the EU declare their war on Russia Perhaps he does not want to be reminded of the WWII joke that the abbreviation LSR, for Luftschutzraum (air raid shelter) was subverted by the German population to mean “Lernt schnell Russisch”, i.e. “learn Russian, quick”. From the Tweet: It also potentially enables plenty of AI applications that were just completely unaffordable before. Say for instance that you want to build a service that helps people summarize books (random example). In AI parlance the average book is roughly 120,000 tokens (since a “token” is about 3/4 of a word and the average book is roughly 90,000 words). At OpenAI’s prices, processing a single book would cost almost $2 since they change $15 per 1 million token. Deepseek’s API however would cost only $0.07, which means your service can process about 30 books for $2 vs just 1 book with OpenAI: suddenly your book summarizing service is economically viable. Great, so now we can cheaply produce inaccurate summaries. Finding a way to make LLM queries potentially profitable is going to unleash an even larger debacle upon the world. It might be a decade before the extent of this debacle becomes clear, depending on how subtle the errors in LLM output are. But others have rightly pointed out that this erodes critical thinking skills, so we’re going to have an entire generation that knows nothing, and has so much damage from COVID, isn’t functional anyway. And this will be the labor basis for our ongoing civilization. Fun times, no? Multiple Pandemics and lack of critical reasoning skills might just ultimately solve the Climate crisis, simply through increasing depopulation and inability to build and maintain damaging toys. Yes, but if you read the commenters above, they neither believe in paying authors for their work or in the concept of competence, so frankly we’ve already entered a new dark age where believing is more important than learning. We just haven’t realized it yet. You’re conflating labor with capital by using the term “work” in an ambiguous way. Maybe we need to start physically punishing PMC when they try to use rhetoric to manipulate others’ emotions using public media. Wdyt? Would that effectively remove petit-bourgeois self-righteousness from the public sphere? It takes a lot of work to write a book, as you’d know if you ever wrote one. If you are lucky, you can sell the book (i.e. its copyright) to pay for that work so as to be able to eat. That’s what copyright was invented for because book printers would simply steal the content. They had the capital (the book presses) and the author got nothing. Somehow today people believe they are entitled to read that book, or train an AI with it, and the author should get nothing. That’s a good way to end authorship, and ensure the only future reading material will be press releases. You forget the era post WWII where Gov funded science and it was shared widely/freely to expand discovery manifold. Gov held the IP, as it were, only gifted away and be abused by private interest for self interest via social status incentives. Social psychology informs more here than dialectal rationalizations. Not to mention per your thrust that most that is written these days is more a matter of post marketing and not individual artist driven motives. All made more complex by how Silicon Valley sorts lead the agenda to gate keep all and everything by being the both platform for readers and library they could pay to read. I mean just look at the Reese Witherspoon Book Club Model Lmmao …. look it up mate … Elon Musk will reinvent copyright, and fix everything. Well, considering how much of the history of intellectual production you erased from history just so you could perform your little virtue signal and conserve your tiresome little institution games, maybe you are incompetent to discuss the matter of copyright. You’ve all proven yourselves manifestly unqualified to run a larp for 2500 years and you think your childish sniveling rises to the level of a FACT? Lmfao, even. I feel no shame whatsoever trampling all over your epistemic “private property” considering that you’re a liar by omission. Also, as AI generated output proliferates, it will increasingly generate content from its own output. AI coprophagy (eating one’s own excrement) is not a recipe for quality output. Concur. I thought I would write a few lines about a sensible gun law that was passed by the California Legislature when I was still living in Oakland more than 20 years ago. That law required the California DOJ to compare the names and Id’s of convicted felons and wife beaters with the names of ID’s of people who had registered firearms before the became prohibited persons. Where there was a match ( As in the case of Sherrif Ross Mirkarimi) the DOJ would generate a letter to that criminal requiring that they provide proof that either their conviction was being appealed or that they had disposed of their firearms legally, withing 30 days. If said proof was not provided in a timely manner a felony arrest warrant was issued and sent to the appropriate law enforcement agency for service. The first objection came from a Southern California Sheriff ( IIRC Riverside County) who complained to the press that if he enforced the law he wouldn’t have any patrol deputies left ( He said the quiet part out loud) the PIO of that office confirmed that @35% of their deputies had pled guilty to spousal abuse. A few other reporters queried other LAw enforcement agencies and the ones that were dumb enough to answer came up with figures as low as 20%. Needless to say not many reporters pursued the matter…their editors and owners were not enthused. The other reason cops didn’t like the Law was that someone might get hurt, someone who mattered…like a cop. So the Cops pursued matters that were much more important, like Civil Asset Forfeiture which yields $4,000,000,000 in profits per annum and which is armed robbery under color of Law. Meanwhile in Gaza. https://scheerpost.com/2025/01/22/day-1-gaza-ceasefire/ OK, could someone explain the phrase, “Open source software that gates basic auth behind a paywall?” I know what open source is, and I know what a paywall is, but I am unclear on the whole, “Gates Basic Auth,” thing. I think that they are saying that the vendor is claiming that it is open source, but requires payment to access the program, which would not make it open source, and it might potentially make it fraud.

Title: BlackRock, Weinstein Reach Truce in Spat on Closed-End Funds

(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. stuck agreements with Boaz Weinstein’s Saba Capital Management that will end the activist-hedge fund’s battle with BlackRock over dozens of closed-end funds whose share prices had tumbled deeply below the value of their underlying assets. As part of the deal, BlackRock agreed to repurchase a big chunk of the shares in two of its largest closed-end funds at a price close to their net asset values — 50% of outstanding shares in the $1.8 billion Innovation and Growth Term Trust (ticker BIGZ) and 40% of the $1.7 billion Health Sciences Term Trust (ticker BMEZ). Saba also entered so-called standstill agreements with 48 other BlackRock funds, according to regulatory filings. BIGZ and BMEZ, which had both had traded at deep discounts in the past, jumped more than 6% on the Tuesday proposals. The two tender offers, at a price of 99.5% of of their net asset values could potentially deliver more than $1.5 billion to shareholders, based on calculation by Bloomberg. Weinstein wrote in a post on X that the changes were made after “constructive discussions with BlackRock” and that “by committing to shareholder-friendly initiatives, liquidity events and governance enhancements, value can be unlocked for all investors.” Saba has spent years and billions of dollars buying up closed-end funds run by BlackRock and other big asset managers after their share prices dipped sharply below the value of the assets they hold, a trading anomaly that Saba said was harming investors. It mounted proxy fights and court battles in a bid to pressure the firms to take steps to erase that gap, including through tender offers to buy back the stock. Last year, Boaz ran proxy fights at 10 BlackRock funds with mixed outcomes. It also sued BlackRock’s ESG Capital Allocation Term Trust (ticker ECAT) over its voting bylaws, which is still subject to litigation in a federal court. Weinstein’s fights center around funds that buy income-producing assets, like junk bonds, municipal debt or dividend-paying stocks, that were hit hard when the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates and investors were looking to bail out. With their performances trailing market benchmarks, the discounted trading prices saddled investors with losses if they sold. The hedge fund manager is bringing a similar playbook to UK’s investment-trust industry and attempting to seize control of a bunch of those firms, including two trusts run by Janus Henderson Group Plc.

Title: ‘A Race of Sovereigns’ Will Serve As Next Catalyst for Higher Bitcoin Prices, Says Analyst Willy Woo

On-chain analyst Willy Woo thinks “a race of sovereigns” will catalyze higher Bitcoin (BTC) prices. In a new interview with Natalie Brunell, Woo says MicroStrategy kicked off the corporate BTC treasury trend in the previous cycle. He predicts the current cycle will see other sovereign wealth funds follow El Salvador and Bhutan’s lead. “I think this cycle, that starts to come out and the cycles ahead. And so everything becomes a race, and I don’t know if these are big unlocks, I think it’s one step after the next and the next and the next.” Woo says a big moment of the current cycle was when BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink expressed approval of BTC. “You’re not going to get fired for recommending Bitcoin. Asset managers [previously] would buy it themselves and not recommend it because it was risky for their career. Now I see CIOs at banks not only talking about Bitcoin as an investment but they’re talking about it as the next world reserve currency.” BTC is trading at $105,785 at time of writing after hitting a new all-time high of more than $108,000 on Monday. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 4% in the past 24 hours. Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) has regained the top spot as the world's most valuable company, with a market capitalization of $3.46 trillion, above Apple (AAPL, Financial) $3.35 trillion. On Tuesday's trading, Nvidia rose 2.2 percent, and Apple fell 3.1 percent, sharply due to analyst downgrades, citing poor iPhone sales and a lacklustre consumer electronics market. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. The fact that AI is dominating the decisions around this historic shift demonstrates why it will take over the economic world. Nvidia's rise is part of a surge in demand for the company's graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are critical for powering AI applications in autonomous vehicles, data centres and other high-growth sectors. Nvidia exceeded 100 percent earnings growth for its third quarter of 2024, along with a 94 percent jump in revenue to $35.1 billion. These results underscore how the company is a key enabler of AI transformations in industries. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said: "Our GPUs are driving the AI-driven transformation across industries." AI is at the heart of every business, and we are entering a new era of computing. Overall, the slowdown in these markets is illustrative of broader strategic issues impacting consumer electronics companies.

Title: Worries for Ireland as Trump moves on corporation tax

Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning Ireland’s corporation tax bonanza of recent years has been well documented, but now that Donald Trump is back in office, that particular gravy train may be about to come under threat. US president Donald Trump has moved to pull his country out of a landmark global corporate tax deal, setting up a potential stand-off between his administration and the European Union, with Ireland caught in the middle. Jack Power and Eoin Burke-Kennedy have the details, while Cliff Taylor breaks down just what is at stake in the row. Trump was inevitably the main topic of discussion at the second day of the World Economic Forum at Davos, with EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and German leader Olaf Schultz among those choosing their words carefully. Eoin is at the forum in the Swiss town, where he also assesses the view on where Trump’s tactics come from. Intel is still betting big on Ireland with the company’s €17 billion Leixlip plant seen as an “critical” to reversing the slide in the once-dominant chipmaker’s fortunes, according to sources close to the company. Eoin has the details. Kilkenny-based nutrition group Glanbia is planning a restructuring of the administrative functions at its Irish locations in a move that will involve up to 60 redundancies, some of them compulsory. As Ciaran Hancock reports, staff have been informed that a new centralised unit is being established – Glanbia Enterprise Solutions – for the delivery of finance, HR and IT services to the business. Some of this work will be outsourced to third-party providers. The economy is currently experiencing a “moderation” in growth, according to Ibec, which is forecasting a slowdown in employment growth in the coming years. As Colin Gleeson reports, the business lobby group’s latest economic outlook is forecasting gross domestic product growth of 1.7 per cent this year and 2.1 per cent in 2026. It says the moderation is “not unexpected”, particularly given the turbulence faced by some of Ireland’s largest trading partners. With the next government set to be formally take power today, John McManus looks at what we can expect from the new(ish) team, and what deals may have been agreed to get a working majority into place. How hard is it to save, really? In Money Matters, Joanne Hunt looks at how a little bit of planning, and consistently setting aside just a few euros per month, can add up quickly. BNY Mellon has announced the closure of its facility in Wexford with about 300 jobs impacted. The global financial firm employs about 310 employees at its offices in the Drinagh Business Park on the outskirts of the town. There had been widespread reports over recent days that jobs at the firm were in jeopardy. Brendan Furlong has the story. Online payments firm Stripe is to make 300 staff redundant over the coming months, including a small number in Ireland, as part of what is understood to be a review of some aspects of its operations. A consultation process has been initiated with the people whose roles are expected to be impacted and this is expected to be complete within a matter of weeks. Emmet Malone reports. The Blackrock Clinic is to create 50 jobs by establishing a women’s health centre over four floors in a new Dublin city centre location “in a pivotal step forward in enhancing women’s health services”, the company said. Gordon Deegan has the story. Munich Re, the world’s largest reinsurance group, is seeking to cut as many as 18 jobs – or almost 12 per cent of roles – within its Irish software technology unit, Munich Re Automation Solutions, as part of a restructuring of the business. In Commercial Property, Fiona Reddan reports that The Morrison Hotel, on Dublin’s north quays, has been put up for sale, with the sellers seeking between €90 million and €95 million. If it achieves this price level then owner Zetland Capital/Centauro Holdings, a UK private equity investor, would stand to secure a significant return on its original €65 million investment.

Title: Paralyzed man flies virtual drone by thought alone
URL: https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/paralyzed-man-flies-virtual-drone-by-thought-alone/
Time Published: 2025-01-22T06:25:29Z
Full Content:
A man with paralysis has been able to fly a virtual drone using only his thoughts. The feat was made possible by a brain-computer interface (BCI) that decoded the man’s brain activity in real time, Nature reported this week. The neural signals were associated with finger movements that enabled control of the virtual drone. “There’s a lot of things that we enjoy or do as humans where we use multiple individuated finger movements, so like typing, sewing, playing a musical instrument,” said Matthew Willsey, the study’s co-author and a neurosurgeon at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “That’s what this line of work is focused on — how we enable the control of multiple things at the same time.” Willsey added that the experiment could’ve been performed with a real drone but the team decided to use a virtual one for ease and safety. The 69-year-old man who participated in the study told the researchers that controlling the virtual object felt like playing a musical instrument, saying: “Flying [the virtual drone] is tiny little finesses off a middle line, a little bit up, a little bit down.” The man’s BCI was fitted by Blackrock Neurotech and was implanted in the area of the brain that controls hand motion. An AI model was used to map the neural signals received by the BCI’s electrodes to the man’s thoughts, New Scientist explained. The participant first went through a process of learning how to imagine some of his fingers moving in a way that created electrical signals of varying strength, which later allowed him to pilot the virtual drone through an obstacle course. Willsey said that for the participant, the test was the realization of “a dream that he thought was lost once he suffered his injury. He had a passion and a dream for flying. He seemed very empowered and enabled — he would have us take videos and send it to friends.” BCI technology has made significant advancements in recent years, with companies like Elon Musk’s Neuralink also developing a device that is currently undergoing human testing. Once fully developed, a slew of exciting applications could bring significant freedom and independence to those with paralysis. They include allowing people with severe paralysis or locked-in syndrome to communicate by translating neural activity into text or speech simply through their thoughts. It can also enable people to use computers, play games, and operate wheelchairs and robotic prosthetics, and even do things like grasp objects or scratch their face. However, challenges remain with the technology, including medical risks from the surgery required to implant a BCI device. High levels of concentration are also required from the person using the device, with current BCIs correctly recognizing mental commands only about 80% of the time, and up to 30% of users failing to get it to function at all. The health and psychological implications of the technology, including cognitive fatigue and long-term exposure to electromagnetic fields, are also not yet fully understood. These and other challenges highlight the need for continued research and development to improve BCI technology, deal with safety concerns, and create appropriate regulatory frameworks.

USYC, or the Hashnote Short Duration Yield Coin, is backed by U.S. Treasury debt and reverse repurchase agreements, with a total asset value of over $1.25 billion, according to RWA data. It comes as multiple businesses seek to tap into an anticipated lucrative boom for real-world asset tokenization. The move is also expected to bolster Circle’s standing against rival and stablecoin giant Tether, which launched its tokenization platform, Hadron, in November. Supporting the integration, Circle has partnered with DRW subsidiary Cumberland, a major institutional crypto trading firm, which will underpin the integration between the fund and Circle’s stablecoin, USDC. Cumberland will expand liquidity and settlement capabilities for USDC and USYC in a bid to drive broader adoption in both crypto and traditional capital markets, according to a statement on Tuesday. The integration is expected to place USYC as a preferred yield-bearing collateral for exchanges, custodians, and prime brokers in both crypto and traditional finance markets, Circle said. Speaking on the partnership, Circle’s CEO Jeremy Allaire said Tuesday on X there exists an “enormous opportunity” to “bring yield-bearing collateral to crypto market structures” around the clock. “One of the Holy Grails of capital markets is the ability to move between cash and collateral instantly,” he said. “We are unlocking this with a focus on the well-established crypto capital markets.” TMMFs are blockchain-based digital versions of traditional financial assets, such as Treasury bills, offering faster ways to invest in yield-generating instruments. Plans to deploy native USDC on Canton, a blockchain tailored for secure and private financial applications, were also announced. Canton processes over $3.6 trillion in tokenized RWAs and facilitates more than $1.5 trillion in monthly repo transactions, the companies said. The tokenization of real-world assets, which converts ownership rights of physical assets into blockchain-based tokens, is gaining traction. The total value locked in the sector has risen 36.9% in a year to $7.89 billion, as per DeFiLlama data. That’s expected to balloon to more than $50 billion by some estimates. Spying an early opportunity, the world’s asset manager, BlackRock, launched a fund of its own on Ethereum in March of last year, allowing qualified investors to earn U.S. dollar yields. Dubbed the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), the vehicle reportedly contains more than $500 million in assets under management. “Circle is leading the way in bringing the most important building blocks of money onchain, fostering a more scalable model of global institutional adoption of crypto infrastructure, while also paving the way for onchain money to become the core of traditional financial markets,” Allaire said in his post.

Title: Bitcoin mining revenue hits $45M – Understanding what it means for you
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-mining-revenue-hits-45m-understanding-what-it-means-for-you/
Time Published: 2025-01-22T06:00:22Z

Bitcoin mining saw a surge in revenue, highlighting potential for sustained growth or a new bull cycle. Bitcoin [BTC] mining has long been a key indicator of market health. Recent spikes in mining revenue and network activity seemed to suggest that the Bitcoin network could be entering a new phase. With daily mining revenue reaching approximately $45 million, current conditions closely mirror the high network activity seen during Bitcoin’s previous bull cycles. However, the big question remains – Does this surge in mining revenue signal the start of another explosive bull run, or is it an indication of sustained growth that is less tied to immediate price fluctuations? The recent surge in Bitcoin mining revenue, reaching approximately $45 million daily, highlights a significant boost in network activity. This hike signals not only a healthy ecosystem, but also heightened miner confidence. As miners continue to secure the Bitcoin network, metrics like hash rate and block difficulty provide valuable insights into its overall strength. A rising hash rate means greater participation and computing power, while climbing block difficulty hints at a more challenging environment for miners. Together, these indicators point to a thriving Bitcoin network that could be gearing up for a new phase of growth. Bitcoin’s historical data revealed a clear correlation between mining revenue spikes and the onset of bull markets. In late 2017 and early 2021, mining revenues soared alongside high network activity and transaction fees, signaling investor enthusiasm and price rallies to all-time highs. For instance, in late 2017, mining revenue surged past $50 million daily, coinciding with Bitcoin’s climb to $20,000. Similarly, early 2021 saw revenues spike to over $60 million as Bitcoin reached $60,000. These surges reflected strong network fundamentals, such as rising hash rates and transaction volumes, which typically precede price booms. Source: Cryptoquant The daily mining revenue of $45 million seemed to align closely with these historical thresholds, suggesting a potential bullish signal. However, the impact of this figure can extend beyond immediate price speculation. It underlined strong network activity, miner confidence, and growing adoption, hinting that Bitcoin’s ecosystem is solidifying. If historical patterns hold, the current mining revenue could foreshadow a significant price rally or signal sustained, steady growth driven by a thriving, secure network. Either scenario would reaffirm Bitcoin’s position as a resilient, maturing asset class. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $104,551 with a steady upward trend in recent sessions. The RSI at indicated bullish momentum but not yet overbought territory, suggesting room for further upward movement. On-balance volume at -89.25K reflected growing accumulation, supporting the price action. Source: TradingView Historical resistance levels near $110,000 could act as a critical test for continued momentum. If breached, it may signal the onset of a broader bull run. However, sustained volume and a push beyond the RSI threshold of 70 are needed to confirm a strong trend. The press time data supported optimism, but necessitated careful monitoring for confirmation of a sustained breakout. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2025–2026 Bitcoin mining appears to be entering a phase of sustained growth, independent of traditional market cycles. Increasing institutional adoption by major players like BlackRock and Fidelity is stabilizing the market, while global demand for Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and an alternative financial system continues to grow. Technological advancements in mining hardware, such as energy-efficient ASICs, are further enhancing profitability, ensuring miners stay competitive even as block rewards decrease. Long-term trends point to a transformation in mining economics. As block rewards halve every four years, transaction fees are expected to become the primary revenue source, driving miners to adopt renewable energy and cost-efficient practices. By aligning with sustainability and technological innovation, Bitcoin mining may well-positioned for continued growth and relevance in the evolving digital economy.

Title: Commission of investigation into abuse in schools ‘a priority’ for new government
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2025/01/22/commission-of-investigation-into-abuse-in-schools-a-priority-for-new-government/

A commission of investigation into abuse in schools, including private fee-paying schools, will be “a priority” for the new government, Minister for Education Norma Foley has said. In a letter to survivors this week, she assured them “that there has been no let-up in the work being carried out by the high-level group that I set up to progress the establishment of the commission of investigation” into abuses in the schools. Noting that she herself was “part of the negotiating team during the talks on the formation of a new government”, she was “pleased to say that the programme for government contains a specific provision in relation to the next steps following the report of the scoping inquiry”. [ Further 12 Spiritan abuse survivors come forward since September’s scoping inquiryOpens in new window ] This, she said, stated that: “Cognisant of the experience of survivors of historical abuse and in line with their wishes as per the scoping inquiry of Mary O’Toole SC, we will as a priority establish and support the work of a commission of investigation as agreed by Cabinet in September 2024.” Last September, the Government formally agreed to establish a statutory inquiry into the sexual abuse of children at day and boarding schools, following recommendations in the 700-page scoping inquiry report, led by Ms O’Toole. The inquiry was set up following revelations of widespread sexual abuse of boys at Willow Park and Blackrock College in south Co Dublin. It followed the broadcast of RTÉ radio documentary Blackrock Boys in November 2022 and the launch that month also of a restorative justice programme involving abuse survivors and the Spiritan congregation, which runs the schools. [ Abuse report: Full list of 308 schools and case numbers detailedOpens in new window ] Last September’s scoping inquiry report disclosed 2,395 allegations of sexual abuse at 308 schools run by religious congregations, involving 884 alleged abusers. A high number of allegations were concentrated in special education schools, where 590 allegations were recorded in 17 institutions involving 190 alleged abusers. In her letter this week, Ms Foley said the high-level group to which she referred had also been asked to consider other recommendations of the scoping inquiry report, related to “redress, child protection and memorialisation”. “I am conscious that you and other survivors want to see early action, and so the group was asked to report as quickly as possible. I can confirm that its work has been progressing well and it expects to report shortly,” she said. [ Statutory inquiry into sexual abuse of children at day and boarding schools agreed at CabinetOpens in new window ] She hoped her letter would assure survivors “of the ongoing commitment of government in responding to the appalling historical sexual abuse experienced by survivors which was set out in the devastating accounts contained in the report of the scoping inquiry”. Expressing her “personal gratitude” to survivors “for engaging in the process”, she said she was “conscious that your courage has inspired, and will inspire, many others to step forward and share their experiences. I will also be forever grateful for the open, honest and honourable manner in which so many of you engaged with me on a personal basis. Thank you.” Patsy McGarry is a contributor to The Irish Times © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Wachtell Lipton Discusses Court Ruling that BlackRock’s Inclusion as Investment Manager Breaches ERISA Duty of Loyalty
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/01/22/wachtell-lipton-discusses-court-ruling-that-blackrocks-inclusion-as-investment-manager-breaches-erisa-duty-of-loyalty/
Time Published: 2025-01-22T05:01:03Z
Full Content:
The District Court for the Northern District of Texas recently ruled that a company breached its fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) for permitting BlackRock’s inclusion as an investment manager of its employees’ retirement assets in a 401(k) Plan. After a four-day bench trial, the Court found that the company failed to “loyally act solely in the retirement plan’s best financial interests by allowing their corporate interests, as well as BlackRock’s ESG interests, to influence management of the plan.” Core to the Court’s holding is its evidentiary determination that BlackRock “pursues a pervasive ESG agenda” that “covertly converts the retirement plan’s core index portfolios to ESG funds,” and that this harms the financial interests of 401(k) participants. As we have noted in prior memos, including The Future of ESG: Thoughts for Boards and Management in 2024, the politicization of ESG has led to “anti-ESG” legislation in several states and a general corporate and investor retreat from use of the term. BlackRock itself has publicly disavowed the term and recently began expanding voting choice programs to include voting policies that oppose energy transition and decarbonization efforts to appeal to a wider swath of its client base and allay the concerns of regulators. The Court ruling notes these recent moves, including BlackRock’s 2024 announcement that it was leaving Climate Action 100+, citing these distancing efforts as “telling” evidence of BlackRock’s “apparent recognition” that ESG investing was problematic under ERISA. The Court found that the company “turned a blind eye to BlackRock’s ESG activism,” and did not sufficiently “monitor, evaluate, and address” the extent to which BlackRock was pursuing a “non-pecuniary ESG investment strategy.” The ruling described BlackRock’s influence over the company—as one of the company’s largest shareholders and a significant debt holder—as the explanation for the company’s “lack of accountability with respect to BlackRock.” This ruling adds an additional layer of consideration for companies and boards seeking to navigate the evolving regulatory and legal landscape on ESG matters. It remains an appropriate and essential part of business judgment for companies to evaluate how key business risks—including those related to the environment, employees, and communities in which companies operate—may impact long-term performance.

Head to be able to the Lucky Steer­ing wheel in the Dia­mond Casi­no and you want the steer­ing wheel lay­out to have cloth­ing at the top, togeth­er with the 50k sec­tion to the depart­ed and 2, five-hun­dred RP seg­ment in order to the right.

Also, if a per­son want to run small businesses00 in Los San­tos, find out how to reg­is­ter as a CEO or an MC Leader. This week’s Patch note updates aren’t released by the Rock­star Games because of now. As the great major­i­ty of typ­i­cal­ly the pop­u­la­tion is shift­ing towards gam­bling upon the go, that becomes imper­a­tive regard­ing your next on line casi­no to have” “an inno­v­a­tive app. All online and live casi­no games offered by sim­ply the rec­om­mend­ed casi­nos above are actu­al­ly licensed for fair­ness plus safe­ty.

They also sup­ply quick trans­fers in addi­tion to can help an indi­vid­ual unlock high­er-val­ue addi­tion­al bonus­es. The fol­low­ing will be gives you can antic­i­pate to find any time you’re just sign­ing up to a new casi­no. If you live in Turkey in addi­tion to are look­ing regard­ing the most notable casi­no des­ti­na­tions online, look not any fur­ther than our list below! All these sites are licensed and reg­u­lat­ed in Curaçao and accept Euro­pean play­ers. Ide­al­ly, you should leave the table as soon since you are upward, as you have got already beat the home. Hav­ing con­tributed posts in order to the Mal­ta iGam­ing Sem­i­nar 2014 blog and writ­ten con­tent regard­ing the Mal­ta Video gam­ing Authority’s web­site, sim­ply no top­ic is unfa­mil­iar to him. Iggy espe­cial­ly likes to scru­ti­nise casi­no oper­a­tors and games in order to give his vis­i­tors the best pos­si­ble gam­bling expe­ri­ence. Online gam­bling in Poul­try is ille­gal, thus it’s bet­ter to stand care­ful­ly if you opt to per­form so. Opt with regard to off­shore casi­no sites that have recent­ly been licensed from the rel­e­vant author­i­ties in Mal­ta, Gibral­tar, or Curaçao. To set this upwards, you need the Lucky Wheel to be rest­ing with­in the Clothes wedge two sec­tions to the right of the Car wedge, as pic­tured above. With the new Podi­um Auto­mo­biles rotat­ing week­ly, GTA play­ers are upwards for an out­ra­geous spin every week. You can spin and rewrite the Lucky wheel at Dia­mond Casi­no once every day with the” “Scène car chang­ing with­in a week. As it real­ly is up to RNG gods, you have an one in twen­ty chance of get­ting the Podi­um car being a spin reward. While these are dif­fi­cult odds, is there a way to win the On line casi­no Car every moment in GTA 5 Online? Do not adhere to those roulette strate­gies that tell you in order to up your wagers when you are usu­al­ly up, when you will quick­ly lose every thing. Don’t get com­pla­cent just because you’re over a win­ning abil­i­ty, that tends in order to be the down­fall of even the par­tic­u­lar great­est roulette par­tic­i­pants. One of the best tips with regard to play­ing roulette will be to” “arranged hard lim­its on your­self, because han­dling your bankroll is real­ly a cru­cial part asso­ci­at­ed with smart casi­no have fun with. Before you enter the casi­no, num­ber out exact­ly just what you desire to devote per spin plus what you are pre­pared to lose just before you get up and leave the sport. It’s a crim­i­nal offence to bet any kind of time casi­no web site, with play­ers fac­ing the same risk asso­ci­at­ed with pros­e­cu­tion as on line casi­no oper­a­tors and pay­ment providers. Let’s say you start­ed your own roulette round along with $100 and you’re now up to $250. At this time, I actu­al­ly would give the deal­er $200 with­in chips in trade for two dark-col­ored $100 chips. Once you have these sim­ple tenets of your own roulette strat­e­gy nailed down, you can start look­ing in oth­er ways to try and win a game of roulette. You’ll only need to be able to fork out for your mem­ber­ship once and it allows you to be able to spin the Blessed Wheel for free as soon as every twen­ty four hours. Once you look at the his­to­ry of vehi­cles that have been on typ­i­cal­ly the podi­um, $500 is a” “lit­tle price to pay for poten­tial­ly earn­ing a mil­lion mon­ey vehi­cle. There’s a new Podi­um Vehi­cle at the Dia­mond Casi­no imme­di­ate­ly! Let’s state you are oper­at­ing out­side bets upon red and the par­tic­u­lar” “last 10 spins have the abil­i­ty to come up black. You might end up being think­ing that red is well past due and that it’s time to wager on that. How­ev­er, typ­i­cal­ly the like­li­hood of red­dish com­ing up will be still the very same since the like­li­hood asso­ci­at­ed with black. GTA On the inter­net is a lot of var­i­ous activ­i­ties and objec­tives every play­er may do in the par­tic­u­lar game. While this process isn’t guar­an­teed to ensure you get the vehi­cle every time, we must admit that this gen­er­al­ly seems to reward this gen­er­al­ly. We have got­ten the scène vehi­cle around four or five times using this tech­nique. If you fall short to get the car, you could always quit out of the game and load in. There is a slight hold off between once you win and the sport updat­ing. If a per­son close out typ­i­cal­ly the app before typ­i­cal­ly the game updates, this won’t keep your award, allow­ing you to be able to try again. If you need to tru­ly taste the flavour regard­ing live deal­er good­ness, Fez­bet has almost every­thing you could wish as a Turk­ish play­er. The most pop­u­lar are wel­come bonus­es, which are usu­al­ly avail­able to fresh play­ers after sign­ing up and gen­er­at­ing an account. The two-door Karin Pre­vion is real­ly a vehi­cle we all high­ly rec­om­mend tak­ing to Los San­tos Prac­tices if you win that. The cus­tomi­sa­tion” “prob­a­ble of this car is high, spe­cial­ly since it has amaz­ing speed, accel­er­a­tion in addi­tion to trac­tion stats at its base degree. Its brak­ing is the low­est of its three base num­bers, though this could eas­i­ly be enhanced with a bit asso­ci­at­ed with cash any kind of time garage. Each week inside the Dia­mond Casi­no of GTA On-line, a fea­tured car is up inside the Podi­um for any­one’s tak­ing.

Title: The end of ESG and ‘sustainability’ nonsense?

Time Published: 2025-01-22T01:56:00Z

By John Stossel January 21, 2025 “Sustainability” investments became popular a few years back. So-called experts said companies shouldn’t just focus on profit. They should put more effort into being “nice.” Funds pushing ESG (environmental, social and governance) were all the rage. Giant investment firms like BlackRock pressured companies to hire more women and minorities. CEO Larry Fink announced, “All investments are going to be looked through sustainability.” Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! But “sustainability” is a mostly meaningless word. Parnassus claimed it helped meet U.N. sustainability goals of “nutrition” and “sanitation” by investing in U.S. Foods and Clorox. Starbucks phased out plastic straws while adding lids that used more plastic. BP rebranded itself as “Beyond Petroleum.” Wisely, it mostly invested in petroleum. Former Vice President Al Gore made money peddling climate change hysteria. He created “sustainability investment funds,” claiming “sustainability factors … actually enhance returns!” His funds did enhance Gore’s own returns; he made millions. But over the past three years, his “sustainable” fund underperformed the stock market. Recently, the fund managers admitted they “made investment mistakes.” Most funds promoting “sustainable investment” did worse than the market. So, why did trillions of dollars pour into such funds? “Because of pressures,” says Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Investments, in my new video. “Their largest clients are blue states’ pension (funds) like CalPERS and the New York pension (fund) who put pressure on them: ‘Adopt these agendas or you’re going to lose us as your largest customer!'” CalPERS still brags about “mitigating climate risk” and adding “climate-conscious board members” to Exxon’s board. Presidential Climate Envoy John Kerry pompously bullied banks: “They will invest into climate-related efforts,” he intoned. Today, banks and even Blackrock are running from sustainability nonsense. “What you’re seeing,” says Cole, “is ESG funds shuttering at record speed … and they’re not apologizing.” Progressives never do. This fad didn’t just hurt investors; it hurt companies that America needs. America needs high-performance computer chips. Intel was once the leading manufacturer of such chips. But now, even as Congress gives Intel billions in taxpayer handouts, the company is cutting thousands of jobs. Why? While Intel’s competitors innovated, Intel obsessed about “sustainability.” Intel’s website lists endless ESG goals like “environmental, health, wellness, and safety programs to care for people and the planet.” It even brags about “green software” … whatever that is. That’s a lot of energy spent not making the best chip. When companies spend time sucking up to politicians rather than innovating, they often decline. Intel’s stock fell 60% last year. Fortunately, today more companies are focusing on basic capitalism – producing better products for less money. Ford recently announced it will no longer require employees to take LGBTQ advocacy group surveys. USA Today reports that Lowe’s will reduce its participation with the Human Rights Campaign to “narrow its focus to safe and affordable housing.” When I was co-host of “20/20,” I wondered what would happen when Disney bought ABC. Not much changed for a while. But a few years later, after repeatedly rejecting videos I proposed about problems with Obamacare, ABC fired me. Still later, I laughed as I watched Disney go full woke. The president of the entertainment content division said, “We have many, many, many LGBTQIA characters in our stories, and yet we don’t have enough leads.” Disney’s television animation producer added, “I was just, wherever I could, adding queerness.” But many such movies flopped. “The Marvels,” featuring a Muslim teen and black female sidekick, lost $237 million. “Lightyear,” featuring the first same-sex kiss in a Disney-Pixar movie, lost $106 million. “Elemental,” featuring a nonbinary character (a lake with earrings), didn’t even reach $30 million it’s opening week. Now Disney’s quietly scaling back. More companies have started to recognize a need to focus on their core business rather than virtue-signaling. “It’s the beginnings of an unwind,” says Cole, “that I think is going to be critical for us to achieve success.” I wonder why they were so dumb in the first place.

By Stephen Nellis and Krystal Hu (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT) on Tuesday said it has changed some key terms of a deal with OpenAI after the ChatGPT creator announced a joint venture with Oracle (ORCL) and Japan's SoftBank Group to build up to $500 billion of new AI data centers in the United States. President Donald Trump gathered the leaders of the "Stargate" effort at the White House on Tuesday to announce the deal, saying it was intended to help keep the United States ahead of China and other rivals in the global AI race, using chips from Nvidia (NVDA). Since 2019, Microsoft has had arrangements with OpenAI that gave the Redmond, Washington-based company the exclusive right to build new computing infrastructure for OpenAI. Microsoft, in a blog post, said it has "approved OpenAI's ability to build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models." That opened the door for OpenAI to work with Oracle. A person familiar with the deal said that Stargate is a joint venture structured as new entity in which OpenAI has an equity stake, governance rights and operational control. It will have a separate board appointed by the founding members and its own CEO, this person said. The venture will also have other investors including United Arab Emirates firm MGX. Microsoft, along with Nvidia and Arm, will be a "technology partner" in the new venture, but is not listed as an equity funder. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son is will be the entity's board chairman, according to a statement from OpenAI posted on social media site X. But Microsoft said that it still retains the exclusive right to offer OpenAI's API - technology shorthand for application programming interface, which is the main way that software developers and business customers buy OpenAI's services. That means Oracle will not be able to host OpenAI's primary source of revenue. Oracle did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Microsoft's statements. Microsoft said it has "revenue sharing agreements that flow both ways" with OpenAI. "The key elements of our partnership remain in place for the duration of our contract through 2030, with our access to OpenAI’s IP, our revenue sharing arrangements and our exclusivity on OpenAI’s APIs all continuing forward," Microsoft said. Microsoft also said "OpenAI recently made a new, large Azure commitment that will continue to support all OpenAI products as well as training," referring to Microsoft's Azure cloud computing service.

Title: SK Hynix’s 26% Gain This Year Under Pressure From Trump Trades

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- This year’s 30% AI-driven rally in shares of South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc. faces threats as political issues and valuations push local investors toward domestic-focused companies. Most Read from Bloomberg How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen NY’s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools Korean retail traders are on course for their biggest monthly withdrawal from the memory chipmaker in at least a decade. With the stock on course for its best January since 2009, market observers say the temptation to take some money off the table is high. AI leader Nvidia Corp. lost steam this month on concerns over competition and slower growth. Korean investors, meanwhile, have been rotating into non-tech beneficiaries of President Donald Trump’s policies as well as smaller local stocks expected to enact corporate reforms. “The market is paying more attention to the issues that could see swift changes after Trump takes office,” such as in the energy sector, said An Hyungjin, chief executive officer at Seoul-based Billionfold Asset Management Inc. “I have concerns that if Nvidia’s rally stalls, whether SK Hynix can gain further.” Results due Thursday morning from SK Hynix are expected to show record quarterly net income of 5.9 trillion won ($4 billion). That comes as the firm is benefiting from its position as a leading supplier of high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to work alongside Nvidia’s AI processors. Its share price has more than doubled in two years on the AI excitement, though that lags far behind the sevenfold gain in Nvidia. The broader chip sector, including memory, has been restrained by lingering concerns over sluggish demand for autos and electronics. SK Hynix shares gained 3.4% on Wednesday, joining a rally across regional peers, after US President Donald Trump’s announcement about a joint venture to fund AI infrastructure. Korean investors may be taking profits on SK Hynix after its big gains, “as memory prices are still expected to be trending downwards in the first half of 2025,” said Gary Tan, a portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. At the same time, foreign investors that have driven the stock higher “could be viewing memory as a laggard in the AI space.” SK Hynix’s rally has made the stock look pricey. Its trading at a price-to-book ratio to 2.8 times, above its three year average of 1.6 times. Beyond valuations, investors are being lured away from the tech sector and into sectors including shipbuilding and nuclear power on expectations for boosts from Trump’s policies. At home, some investors expect the opposition party’s corporate reform agenda to gain traction following the impeachment of the President Yoon Suk Yeol over his botched attempt to impose martial law. Smaller, domestically focused companies with room for improvement on shareholder returns are seen as particular beneficiaries. “There are many companies that could outperform with the commercial code revision,” said Marcello Seongsoo Ahn, a portfolio manager at Quad Investment Management Co. “SK Hynix shares may rise but their gains will be outpaced by those companies.” Top Tech Stories President Donald Trump announced a joint venture to fund artificial intelligence infrastructure worth billions of dollars with the leaders of Softbank Group Corp., OpenAI LLC, and Oracle Corp., an effort aimed at speeding development of the emerging technology. Meta Platforms Inc. is working on upgrades to its popular smart glasses and is exploring new wearable devices such as watches and camera-equipped earbuds, aiming to embed its artificial intelligence features into more products. Apple Inc. received a pair of analyst downgrades, in the latest sign that soft iPhone sales are becoming an increasing concern for investors, as artificial intelligence fails to act as a hoped-for growth catalyst.

Title: BlackRock and Weinstein's Saba reach settlement in battle over closed-end funds

By Svea Herbst-Bayliss NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Saba Capital Management announced a standstill in a long-raging battle over the future of closed-end funds with the asset manager buying back shares in two portfolios and the hedge fund dropping demands for deep management changes. BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, said it will buy back 50% of outstanding shares in its BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust and 40% of outstanding shares in Health Sciences Term Trust for a price of 99.5% of each fund's net asset value. A total of roughly $1.6 billion is being tendered in these funds alone, more than has ever been available to investors. In return, Saba, a large owner in BlackRock's closed-end funds, agreed to stop its campaigns at dozens of BlackRock funds calling for fresh directors to be installed and for BlackRock to be fired as some of the funds' manager. The agreement lasts for three proxy seasons. "This is a monumental outcome for shareholders," Saba's founder Boaz Weinstein wrote on social media platform X. He said the settlement shows how shareholders and managers can find a "win-win" solution. "By committing to shareholder-friendly initiatives, liquidity events and governance enhancements, value can be unlocked for all investors." Saba's Weinstein has for years waged a battle against closed-end funds run by BlackRock and other companies that oversee billions of dollars, arguing they charge high fees and deliver lackluster returns with limited opportunities for average investors to get their money out. The settlement comes some seven months after BlackRock shareholders voted at 10 of its closed-end funds to keep the asset manager's directors in place and retain it as the manager at six funds. Saba has long criticized the gap between the assets held by closed-end funds and their share prices and wanted to install new directors and at some funds fire the manager. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, don't issue or redeem new shares, which can leave them trading above or below the value of the securities held by the fund. Weinstein has been crusading against these types of portfolios for some time and late last year took his fight overseas by urging shareholders in seven UK investment trusts to replace directors and install his hedge fund as the manager. He argued the current boards failed to deliver "sufficient shareholder returns." (This story has been corrected to say that investors voted at a total of 10 funds, not 4, in paragraph 7)

Title: Banks Ditch Net Zero as Climate Alliances Crumble

More Info A few years ago, the world’s biggest banks and asset managers raced to commit to funding the energy transition and drop fossil fuel projects from portfolios as they came under shareholder and market pressure to join net-zero alliances. But after years of scrutiny and blacklisting from Republican states in the U.S. and lawsuits from Republican attorney generals, North American banks and asset managers began quitting net-zero alliances en masse following President Donald Trump’s election victory. Net Zero Exodus The top U.S. banks and four of Canada’s largest banks are no longer part of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), a group of leading global banks committed to aligning their lending, investment, and capital markets activities with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Now several European banks are considering withdrawing from the NZBA, too, while the leading figures of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) – the umbrella group for the finance institutions that have pledged net zero goals – are struggling to hold their regular annual meeting this month, the Financial Times reports, citing sources with knowledge of the situation. Some of Europe’s biggest banks are rethinking their membership and involvement in net-zero initiatives as Donald Trump returns to office and Republican-led U.S. states are going after “woke capital.” This, they say, discriminates against America’s oil, gas, and coal industry by committing to net-zero portfolios and adopting principles that could reduce financing for fossil fuel projects. Since early December, the biggest U.S. banks – Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and JP Morgan – have all quit the NZBA. Commenting on the banks’ withdrawals, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said, “More and more financial institutions are taking a major step in the right direction by leaving the radical and anti-energy Net-Zero Banking Alliance. “The NZBA seeks to undermine our vital oil and gas industries, and membership could potentially prevent banks from being able to enter into contracts with Texas governmental entities,” Paxton added. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, early this month quit the parallel Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in the latest exit of a major financial institution from a climate finance alliance since Trump was elected U.S. President. BlackRock has decided to leave the voluntary Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, which launched in December 2020 and aims to “support the asset management industry to commit to a goal of net zero emissions in order to mitigate financial risk and to maximize long-term value of assets.” The world’s top asset manager has quit the initiative because its membership has “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand wrote in a letter to institutional clients. Net Zero Under Scrutiny BlackRock and major banks have come under increased pressure from Republican politicians and Republican-governed states over their pledges to scale back funding for fossil fuel projects. Texas authorities, for example, have decided to withdraw $8.5 billion in assets of the Permanent School Fund from the asset manager. The Texas legislature passed a law in 2021 to penalize financial firms that, according to state authorities, discriminate against energy companies. At the end of November, a group of Republican states led by Texas sued BlackRock and fellow asset managers Vanguard and State Street for alleged violation of antitrust laws. The states allege that the asset managers have been pressuring coal firms to lower output to cut emissions, thus driving up electricity prices in America. Since leaving the net-zero asset managers’ alliance, BlackRock has reached a settlement with the state of Tennessee, which had sued the world’s biggest asset manager for misleading consumers regarding the role of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors in its investment practices. The settlement concluded a lawsuit filed by the State of Tennessee under the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). “The Americans are totally obsessed about not being sued by Texas. The banks have been the worst,” a European executive involved in the Glasgow initiative told FT. Canadian banks BMO, National Bank, TD Bank Group, and CIBC also quit the net-zero banking alliance last week. European lenders have threatened to follow suit unless NZBA eases rules and ends “all formal tracking and any issues that are perceived contrary to US antitrust”, according to FT’s sources. The asset managers’ net zero alliance is already struggling under the pressure. A week ahead of President Trump’s inauguration, the Net Zero Asset Managers said it was launching a review of the initiative. “Recent developments in the U.S. and different regulatory and client expectations in investors’ respective jurisdictions have led to NZAM launching a review of the initiative to ensure NZAM remains fit for purpose in the new global context,” the alliance said. While the review is ongoing, the initiative is suspending activities to track signatory implementation and reporting. European banks want the net-zero banking alliance to undergo a similar overhaul. Otherwise, they have threatened to quit and follow in the footsteps of the biggest U.S. and Canadian banks. “Several banks have said that unless the banking alliance goes the same way [as] the asset management initiative, they will begin the process to leave,” a source familiar with the banks’ thinking told FT.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against other buzzing AI stocks on latest news and ratings. With President Donald Trump having returned to power, one of the first things he has done is revoke a 2023 executive order signed by Joe Biden seeking to reduce the risks that artificial intelligence posed to consumers, workers, and national security. The revoke marks a significant shift in federal oversight of artificial intelligence technology. READ ALSO: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street and 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings According to Biden’s orders, developers of AI systems posing risks in any way to the US government, the economy, or even public health or safety, needed to share the results of safety tests with the government, which was in line with the Defense Production Act. The order also required agencies to create orders for testing and address related chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and cybersecurity risks. As of now, all key safety and transparency requirements for AI developers have been revoked. While it is currently unclear how the Trump administration will handle rules and regulations regarding AI, it is likely to be more of a “hands-off” approach. Regardless of how it is handled, the one clear thing is that this technology will continue to be extremely transformative. As quoted by CEO of Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala to CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the world has yet to completely recognize the extent of change AI will bring to every aspect of human life. “In terms of the risks … this is a technology that no one today really appreciates, truly the level of disruption that it’s going to create, affecting everything from our lives, our businesses, human capital, employment, and every sector is going to be disrupted. And I think that while there’s a lot of opportunity, it also presents significant amount of risk, which is today unclear, because the technology is moving so fast and we’re all trying to catch up as much as possible”. Al Mubarak is also optimistic about the future of AI and the UAE’s ability to leverage its investment strategy. “The demand is going to be profoundly high in terms of the enablement of that technology. That means “the technology, the AI enablement, which is the infrastructure side of it — be it energy, be it transmission, but also all forms of technology, of energy technology that’s going to help fuel this huge demand, I would also add to that data center build-out, chip build-out.” For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 78 ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), a cloud-based, AI-driven platform, enables enterprises to automate multiple management workflows. On January 21, BofA analyst Brad Sills raised the firm’s price target on ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) to $1,280 from $1,075 and kept a “Buy” rating on the shares. The analyst noted that after talking to key ServiceNow partners, he has found deal activity in Q4 to be “solidly in-line or slightly better” which is “a slight improvement” from Q3. The analyst further argued that ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is “second only to Microsoft (MSFT) with tangible AI revenue”. The company has been leveraging artificial intelligence, particularly generative artificial intelligence, AI, to help customers streamline workflows and processes across various functions. BofA is very optimistic about the company’s top-line growth and share gains. Overall, NOW ranks 3rd on our list of buzzing AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:GILD) is a California-based biotechnology company founded in 1987. The following features make this company a strong investment case. Firstly, the report for the third quarter of 2024 indicates the company’s success in expanding its product offerings and capturing demand in critical healthcare segments, which may attract investment. For instance, as per the report, product sales increased 7% to $7.5 billion compared to the same period in 2023 and total third-quarter 2024 product sales, excluding Veklury, increased 7% to $6.8 billion compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher sales in HIV as well as in Oncology and Liver Disease. Secondly, Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) presented the results of the pivotal Phase 3 PURPOSE 2 trial, which is studying twice-yearly lenacapavir, the company’s injectable HIV-1 capsid inhibitor, for the investigational use of HIV prevention. This may attract investment as it holds the potential to increase revenue streams, estimated to be over $10 billion. Moreover, the company is also advancing its oncology pipeline, including therapies for multiple myeloma and breast cancer. Overall, GILD ranks 11th on our list of Billionaire Steve Cohen’s top stock picks.

Calamos’ first “Protected Bitcoin ETF” will hit the market Wednesday, offering investors 100% downside protection against Bitcoin’s price with limited upside potential. From retail investors to financial advisors, Bitcoin’s risk profile has deterred a notable number of market participants who may be wary of Bitcoin’s steep drawdowns despite its growing adoption, Calamos Head of ETFs Matt Kaufman told Decrypt. “Calamos has built Bitcoin exposure with a safety net, and you can choose how low that safety net goes,” he said. “Bitcoin is a historically extremely volatile asset, and so a lot of people have been on the sidelines watching this experiment turn into an institutional reality.” Calamos’ ETFs will be listed on the Cboe, with its 100% Protected Bitcoin ETF set to debut at a price of $25 Wednesday. The product’s so-called cap range, expected to be anywhere between 10% to 11.5%, will be struck at the end of the day. From that point on, the ETF will aim to offer 100% downside protection against Bitcoin’s price, with a cap range struck again next year. Spot Bitcoin ETFs debuted in the U.S. last year, notching $36.2 billion worth of net inflows as investors and traders flocked to products from Wall Street giants like Fidelity and BlackRock. Since then, Bitcoin’s price has climbed 133% from $46,000 to nearly $107,000, yet some analysts say that registered investment advisors and wirehouses are still warming up to such products. Among institutional investors, 48% of those surveyed in 2023 said that digital assets’ price volatility was a considerable obstacle from an investment standpoint—citing that factor more than anything else, according to a Fidelity Digital Assets report. Meanwhile, 22% of respondents pointed to self-custody concerns, which spot ETFs largely availed. In two weeks, Calamos—which was founded in 1977—will launch additional ETFs with 80% and 90% downside protection against Bitcoin. Those products will have an estimated cap range of 28% to 31% and 50% to 55%, respectively. The products’ risk management framework will be achieved through a combination of U.S. Treasuries and flex options on the CBOE Bitcoin US ETF Index, according to Calamos’ website. Flex options are essentially customizable exchange-listed options, which can have a one-year outcome period, as opposed to expiring on the final Friday of each month, Kaufman said. Calamos, which has $40 billion in assets under management, launched similar products covering the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 last year. Though the products could find use among a professional investment crowd, Kaufman posited that the products could also cater to investors beyond the typical age of your typical crypto bro. “The adoption for Bitcoin has been on the individual or retail level, and it's largely been people younger than myself,” the 45-year-old Kaufman said. “We haven't seen too much of the adoption curve from those older investors, largely because of the risk tolerance that they just can't take.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: TikTok app unavailable on Apple, Google stores in US despite Trump delaying ban

Time Published: 2025-01-21T21:55:55Z
Full Content:
By Doyinsola Oladipo (Reuters) -Three days after ByteDance's TikTok went dark and then was quickly revived in the United States, users who deleted the app were anxiously checking iPhone and Android devices to find it still unavailable to be downloaded again. Some looking to make a quick profit from TikTok fans' desperation listed devices on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) with the app purportedly downloaded for up to $50,000. TikTok still could not be downloaded from the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google app stores in the United States on Tuesday, trapped in legal purgatory by the two tech giants. U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday delaying the enforcement of a ban on the Chinese-owned popular short-video app by 75 days, the legality of which is unclear. TikTok resumed service after Trump's assurances that the company and its partners would not face hefty fines to keep the app running, but it was yet to return to app stores. Other apps owned by ByteDance, including Lemon8 and CapCut, were also no longer available. Meanwhile the search to find a buyer for TikTok continued. Trump said on Tuesday he was open to billionaire Elon Musk's buying the app if the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO wanted to do so. And the chair of the House Select Committee on China, John Moolenaar, met businessmen Kevin O'Leary and Frank McCourt about the potential divestiture of TikTok. Billionaire businessman McCourt's Project Liberty consortium has made a formal offer to buy it, valuing the app without its algorithm at around $20 billion. O'Leary joined the effort, Project Liberty said earlier this month. In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, O’Leary said he would be interested in a TikTok deal, but it’s not possible under current law. "That 50/50 deal, I would love to work with Trump on, so would every other potential buyer ... But the problem with some of these ideas is they are inconsistent with the ruling of the Supreme Court," the investor told CNBC. The back-and-forth has brought out mixed feelings from users, including some who planned to abandon TikTok after seeing Trump so heavily involved in the negotiations that could result in TikTok eventually being sold to one of his allies in the tech industry. "I do not want to continue being a pawn in this hellscape. I am not saying it will make a difference to TikTok but it will make a difference to me," said Nicole Norman, a TikTok user, on Meta's Threads app. "I will not be back on TikTok." Others, however, want TikTok back, which is not possible as long as Apple and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) do not make it available. "I’ve been checking every day," said travel content creator Lauren Scott. Scott, 29, currently in Brazil, read in some Facebook (NASDAQ:META) groups that Americans abroad may be able to access the app if they deleted and re-downloaded it. But that proved not to be the case, leaving her in limbo. The delay may be because Google and Apple are awaiting additional protections before bypassing the ban that punishes the companies for hosting or distributing the app, according to analysts. A notice on Apple's App Store said: "TikTok and other ByteDance apps are not available in the country or region you're in". Google Play showed: "Downloads for this app are paused due to current U.S. legal requirements." Some users have been tinkering with multi-step processes to gain access, such as trying to change their location in their phones. "Really hoping TikTok comes back to the app store ASAP, not wanting to do any of that VPN stuff to get it back," said Lauren Nader, a TikTok user, on Threads. Google, Apple and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment. U.S. legislators last year passed a law upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court requiring ByteDance to either sell TikTok or face a ban, citing national security concerns. Many Democratic and Republican lawmakers still want to see ByteDance sell the app. Trump suggested the United States government should be a half-owner of TikTok's U.S. business in return for keeping the app alive, and warned that he could impose tariffs on China if Beijing failed to approve a deal. China indicated this week for the first time it would be open to a transaction keeping TikTok operating in the United States, with its foreign ministry saying on Monday that companies "decide independently" on matters of their operations and deals. Some users still on TikTok have suggested that the app's algorithm is "feeling different" since it came back online, fanned by fears about the future of the tool under a new ownership structure. TikTok welcomed users back on Sunday with the message, "Thanks for your patience and support. As a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.!" "I deactivated my account after it was 'back' this morning. I'm done with [Trump] taking credit for the messes he starts," said TikTok user Janel Samson on Threads. Over 200 iPhone and Android devices with the app downloaded were listed on the site for sale as of Tuesday night.

As one of the co-founders of Brevan Howard, Rokos played a pivotal role in the firm’s rise to prominence. He specialized in global macro trading, focusing on interest rates, currencies, and government bonds. Rokos was one of the firm’s star traders, reportedly generating over $4 billion in profits for the fund during his tenure. Rokos left Brevan Howard in 2012, taking a sabbatical from trading.

JetBlue (JBLU+2.35%) is now accepting Venmo (PYPL-0.93%) as a payment option for flights booked on its website, making it the first airline to do so, the company announced on Tuesday. The feature will soon be available on the airline’s mobile app. U.S. customers can now use their Venmo balance, linked bank accounts, or debit and credit cards to pay for flights directly. “Adding Venmo offers a seamless payment option for customers who enjoy the ease and convenience of the Venmo platform,” Carol Clements, JetBlue’s chief digital and technology officer, said in a press release. Flexible payment options have grown in popularity in recent years, with many consumers preferring digital platforms like Venmo for everyday transactions. The move is part for JetBlue’s ongoing efforts to enhance its digital experience for travelers, according to John Anderson, senior vice president and general manager of consumer at PayPal, Venmo’s parent company. He noted in the release that the new offering could make managing shared expenses easier, especially for group travel. JetBlue has already introduced other tech-driven features, such as a countdown to boarding on the lock screen of its mobile app and more accessible gate information, the company said. In Sept. 2024, the airline announced plans to add airport lounges for loyalty members. While JetBlue is the first to add Venmo as a payment option, other major airlines like Delta (DAL+0.48%), Frontier, and United (UAL-2.53%) may consider adopting the digital payment option as consumer demand for flexibility grows. Meanwhile, JetBlue remains focused on improving its financial performance, particularly after disruptions such as last year’s CrowdStrike (CRWD-0.83%) outage and Hurricane Milton. “Our number one goal remains returning to operating profitability, and growing our unit revenue is essential to achieve this,” said Marty St. George, JetBlue’s executive vice president of commercial and planning, in a statement in Oct. 2024. “Looking ahead to 2025, I am optimistic about the outlook for our revenue performance, especially as JetForward initiatives begin to deliver results.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. The crypto market thrives on audacious moves and life-changing fortunes. Given the sea of altcoins traded in the space, DTX Exchange is one making rounds right now. Now, experts are predicting significant returns for this viral altcoin. Fast forward to 2025, and DTX shapes up to deliver such gains as well. But rather than rely on hype, this asset introduces innovative features that’d make its rally swifter than that of Dogecoin’s 2021 run. The excitement is building, and if history is any guide, DTX could become the next Dogecoin. Meme coins dominated the crypto space with their eye-catching returns and vitality. But as the hype slowly fades, DTX Exchange is a new player packed with cutting-edge features and revolutionary tech. It aims to become the world’s hybrid trading platform, bridging the best of centralized and decentralized exchanges. This would enable traders easy access to various assets— stocks, cryptocurrencies, forex pairs, and tokenized ETFs. This diverse range of products leverages blockchain’s top-tier security. Furthermore, users can trade these instruments without completing rigorous KYC, thus ensuring unmatched privacy and autonomy. What sets DTX apart is its proprietary layer-1 blockchain, VulcanX, which seamlessly merges tradfi with Web3 technology. Catering to all trading styles, from intraday to swing traders, the platform’s distributed liquidity pool ensures smooth and hassle-free trading across markets. The excitement doesn’t stop there. DTX’s presale has already raised over $12 million, and tokens are flying off the shelves at $0.14, with a launch price pegged at $0.20. This pricing structure offers a golden opportunity to lock in substantial profits before the token is listed publicly. DTX Exchange emphasizes decentralization, eliminating central governance and enabling traders to retain complete control of their funds through its Phoenix Wallet, a non-custodial solution. Holding DTX tokens unlocks exclusive perks, including staking rewards, reduced trading fees, and enhanced user privileges. With its revolutionary approach and record-breaking presale, DTX is positioning itself as a major contender in the DeFi space. As analysts and traders buzz with anticipation, DTX Exchange could become the next big thing, offering traders a unique blend of innovation, privacy, and freedom. Dogecoin’s meteoric rise was powered by community-driven hype rather than utility. This made it into one of the most memorable crypto stories. However, trading at $0.37 today, it’s clear that for DOGE to hit its previous highs, it needs more than just hype — it needs more substantial utility and institutional support. The current price trend reflects significant bearish pressure, indicative of broader market volatility that’s affecting many cryptos. Despite its meme coin status, DOGE struggles to maintain price stability, partly due to its speculative nature and limited use cases compared to rising platforms like DTX Exchange. This is where DTX Exchange steps in. Offering a robust and utility-rich ecosystem, DTX provides a fresh opportunity for DOGE enthusiasts to tap into potential 100x growth by 2025. If you’re looking to capture those nostalgic gains, DTX may just be the next big thing to watch. The crypto world is all about bold moves and early opportunities, and DTX Exchange is primed to become the next success story. With revolutionary utility, strong community backing, and undeniable momentum, DTX is set to deliver massive returns. The stage is set, the excitement is palpable, and the chance may be too good to miss.

Title: TikTok Might Never Be Listed On Apple’s App Store Again, Unless It Cuts Ties With Parent Company ByteDance And Is Acquired By A U.S. Entity
URL: https://wccftech.com/tiktok-might-never-appear-on-apple-app-store-except-for-one-condition/
Time Published: 2025-01-21T21:00:06Z
Full Content:
The ban on TikTok enforced by the government was superseded by an executive order signed by the new U.S. President Donald Trump that allows the short-video-uploading platform to be shielded by this ban for 75 days. In short, it has been a roller-coaster ride, one that Apple and Google have been forced to be a part of since the app was listed on each company’s online store. The reason for banning TikTok comes from its ties with parent company ByteDance, with the authorities believing that the app presents a national security risk to the nation. Despite the executive order signed, Apple and Google have yet to re-enlist TikTok on their respective app stores, and from the looks of it, both technology giants will maintain this stance unless a U.S. firm acquires the video-hosting service. Assuming that it was not clear before, Apple has mentioned the following details in a new support document, summarizing that TikTok and all other applications that have been developed and controlled by ByteDance will not be available to download or update on the Cupertino firm’s App Store. “Apple is obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates. Pursuant to the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, apps developed by ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiaries — including TikTok, CapCut, Lemon8, and others — will no longer be available for download or updates on the App Store for users in the United States starting January 19, 2025.” To clear the confusion, even though Donald Trump has signed an executive order, which protects TikTok and its supporting partners from a ban for 75 days, various experts have stated that the federal law will remain in place, regardless of Trump’s executive order. The only exception for TikTok to continue working in the U.S. is if the newly elected President can prove to Congress that the video-uploading platform has severed its ties with ByteDance and is now owned by a U.S. entity. Since none of the above conditions have been met so far, it is no surprise that Apple and Google are unwilling to bring TikTok back to their app stores, as such an action would likely result in exorbitant fines. For those wondering, 60 percent of TikTok’s ownership comprises of institutional investors such as BlackRock, General Atlantic, and the Carlyle Group, with its founders and global employees owning 20 percent each.

Christopher McMahon, CEO of Aquinas Wealth Advisors and author of “Faithful Finances”, spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): Bank of America’s CEO said that they’ll jump into crypto payments if regulators allow it. Do you think with Trump’s executive orders and the new administration things will be better for Bitcoin investors going forward? CHRISTOPHER MCMAHON (CM): I think that’s a great question. I don’t think we’ve ever seen a more favorable environment for crypto. Bitcoin got up to $109,000 the other day. I think today it’s still $103,000. We actually see it just from this momentum, the president endorsing it, the new head of the SEC coming in as a kind of a crypto guy, we see the thing to be $130,000. There is still a lot that’s unproven. The Bank of America (BAC) chairman was right out and saying if some rules change… Something we have to remember about crypto, which I think we forget about, we get so excited. Two of the biggest guys in the history of crypto are both in jail right now, so even though we have some ETFs that people can buy or they can go directly and so they can feel a little bit safer, it’s still the Wild West. And I think the B of A guy was right on when he said, look, if we get some regulation, this could come to Main Street. It’s not on Main Street yet, but I think it’s coming. And for investors, I think it’s a tremendous opportunity. And I think everybody’s portfolio should have some exposure to crypto. I think when folks say, ah, that’s, you know, that’s no good. Right? That’s bad because I’m not familiar with it, I think they’re really doing their portfolio a disservice. Not a huge allocation, but even a balanced portfolio, maybe 3% or 4%, maybe up to 10% if you’re feeling aggressive. AM: Okay. So it’s still largely speculative, but you see $130,000 as a potential price target. Is there a timeline that you believe will happen? CM: We think before the end of the year because the president and his wife both had meme coins drop yesterday, didn’t they? Which is amazing. And I think this environment is so positive for crypto that we have to understand that people who weren’t investing in crypto yesterday are talking about it today and there’s going to be more people buying it, and some of those large crypto ETFs. And the funds really haven’t penetrated the market as much because the brokers don’t believe it. The financial advisors didn’t believe it. Now the financial advisors are actually getting the memo. They’re going to offer it to their clients and we’re gonna start to see that available. I think we’ll actually start to see it available in some retirement funds in the next couple of years, large 401Ks, which will be a complete gamechanger. AM: Do you see any risks or challenges this year with Bitcoin? CM: Yeah, there’s enormous risk with Bitcoin. [Because] if today someone said, Why is it worth $103,000? I would say that’s based on wild optimism because no one uses Bitcoin to conduct business today. Criminals use Bitcoin to conduct business today. That’s the reality of it. Some very avant-garde early adopters are using it, but most people aren’t using it yet. Have you seen those bank machines, the crypto machines in the convenience stores? I was in a store the other day and I said to the woman, “I’m sorry, has anyone ever used this machine?” And she said, “It’s been here for six months, I’ve never seen anybody use it.” Then she said, “No, wait. Someone actually put their drink on it about three days ago.” So I thought, the person who put all these machines out there really spent a fortune on them, but I think it’s gonna have to be a buy and hold. I think we’re going to have to be ready for extreme volatility because I think we’ll see $130,000, as I said, but I think we’ll also see $70,000 again in the next year or so. So be up and down. AM: Okay. $70,000, as well. CM: Yeah, it’s not gonna be a straight line at all. AM: Okay, gotcha. Which happens first? CM: I think the $130,000 happens first because we’re on the top of that wave, I think where we are right now. AM: Okay. So you said 3-5% is a decent allocation for speculating on Bitcoin. What about the other 95-97% of our portfolio right now? Should people load into Mag Seven again in 2025 or diversify away? CM: That’s a great question and if we own some of those tech stocks now, this Mag Seven, I think we should hold most of them because we’ve been rewarded for Tesla (TSLA) lately. It’s been unbelievable. But I think if you take the Mag Seven the last few years, take the Mag Seven out of the S&P 500, it’s only been averaging about under 8% a year. That means as this market starts to broaden out, there’s enormous opportunities in traditional industries, right? Consumer cyclicals is a huge place. There can be energy. We very much like banking. We like it quite a bit. So we wouldn’t double down on the Magnificent Seven right now. AM: If we’re holding Mag Seven in 2025, then what picks do you have for retail investors? CM: A couple that we like very much are Constellation Energy (CEG). We love it. And it’s simple because it’s a broadbased energy company. We like energy as a whole, and a lot of the larger funds are holding Constellation Energy. Interestingly, they dipped their toe in both pools because they signed a large deal with Microsoft (MSFT) recently to supply energy for for all the AI data centers. That means that they are guaranteed about a 30% runup in their stock over the next 12 months, in our opinion. So we like Constellation Energy quite a bit. Well, there’s a mining company we were talking about earlier, Newmark Mining. We love them. They’re doing copper, they’re doing gold. They’re one of the largest gold and copper miners in the world. Gold is a hedge against inflation, of course. We’re not really worried about the inflation play right now. What we’re really thinking about is the uses of gold and copper and manufacturing. AM: And you mentioned financial services, too. What picks do you have? CM: We like American Express (AXP) quite a bit. We like MasterCard (MA), not as much as we like American Express. And generally we don’t like the regional banks. The regional banks are scaring us a little bit. And here’s why. There’s about a trillion dollars of commercial leases that are coming due. Interest rates haven’t been cut enough yet and unfortunately we have some concerns. Our rush hour traffic’s lower because people just aren’t coming into town as much. Even though we are forcing companies to come back downtown. We see some of these buildings refinancing at higher rates with lower occupancy as a potential real headwind. You know, that’s a term we use, ‘headwind’. We don’t want to say potential crash, but a ‘headwind’ for the market. Unlikely that that would bring the market down and stop all this momentum. Therefore, we like the big banks, the big banks are continuing to get bigger. And we think most of the big banks that we’re used to are undervalued by about 10-12% this year. Why take on undue risk when you have that kind of runup in a very predictable stock. AM: Fascinating. So in your book, there are a lot of tips on how people can invest based on their values. What’s one thing you could tell our audience today? CM: I would say be informed. I think your audience knows how to use the internet as well as anybody does, use these tools that are out there now. I would say technology is the king and demand of your advisors, if this is important to me, I need you to prove to me how you’re vetting this appropriately.

Christopher McMahon, CEO of Aquinas Wealth Advisors and author of “Faithful Finances”, spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): Bank of America’s CEO said that they’ll jump into crypto payments if regulators allow it. Do you think with Trump’s executive orders and the new administration things will be better for Bitcoin investors going forward? CHRISTOPHER MCMAHON (CM): I think that’s a great question. I don’t think we’ve ever seen a more favorable environment for crypto. Bitcoin got up to $109,000 the other day. I think today it’s still $103,000. We actually see it just from this momentum, the president endorsing it, the new head of the SEC coming in as a kind of a crypto guy, we see the thing to be $130,000. There is still a lot that’s unproven. The Bank of America (BAC) chairman was right out and saying if some rules change… Something we have to remember about crypto, which I think we forget about, we get so excited. Two of the biggest guys in the history of crypto are both in jail right now, so even though we have some ETFs that people can buy or they can go directly and so they can feel a little bit safer, it’s still the Wild West. And I think the B of A guy was right on when he said, look, if we get some regulation, this could come to Main Street. It’s not on Main Street yet, but I think it’s coming. And for investors, I think it’s a tremendous opportunity. And I think everybody’s portfolio should have some exposure to crypto. I think when folks say, ah, that’s, you know, that’s no good. Right? That’s bad because I’m not familiar with it, I think they’re really doing their portfolio a disservice. Not a huge allocation, but even a balanced portfolio, maybe 3% or 4%, maybe up to 10% if you’re feeling aggressive. AM: Okay. So it’s still largely speculative, but you see $130,000 as a potential price target. Is there a timeline that you believe will happen? CM: We think before the end of the year because the president and his wife both had meme coins drop yesterday, didn’t they? Which is amazing. And I think this environment is so positive for crypto that we have to understand that people who weren’t investing in crypto yesterday are talking about it today and there’s going to be more people buying it, and some of those large crypto ETFs. And the funds really haven’t penetrated the market as much because the brokers don’t believe it. The financial advisors didn’t believe it. Now the financial advisors are actually getting the memo. They’re going to offer it to their clients and we’re gonna start to see that available. I think we’ll actually start to see it available in some retirement funds in the next couple of years, large 401Ks, which will be a complete gamechanger. AM: Do you see any risks or challenges this year with Bitcoin? CM: Yeah, there’s enormous risk with Bitcoin. [Because] if today someone said, Why is it worth $103,000? I would say that’s based on wild optimism because no one uses Bitcoin to conduct business today. Criminals use Bitcoin to conduct business today. That’s the reality of it. Some very avant-garde early adopters are using it, but most people aren’t using it yet. Have you seen those bank machines, the crypto machines in the convenience stores? I was in a store the other day and I said to the woman, “I’m sorry, has anyone ever used this machine?” And she said, “It’s been here for six months, I’ve never seen anybody use it.” Then she said, “No, wait. Someone actually put their drink on it about three days ago.” So I thought, the person who put all these machines out there really spent a fortune on them, but I think it’s gonna have to be a buy and hold. I think we’re going to have to be ready for extreme volatility because I think we’ll see $130,000, as I said, but I think we’ll also see $70,000 again in the next year or so. So be up and down. AM: Okay. $70,000, as well. CM: Yeah, it’s not gonna be a straight line at all. AM: Okay, gotcha. Which happens first? CM: I think the $130,000 happens first because we’re on the top of that wave, I think where we are right now. AM: Okay. So you said 3-5% is a decent allocation for speculating on Bitcoin. What about the other 95-97% of our portfolio right now? Should people load into Mag Seven again in 2025 or diversify away? CM: That’s a great question and if we own some of those tech stocks now, this Mag Seven, I think we should hold most of them because we’ve been rewarded for Tesla (TSLA) lately. It’s been unbelievable. But I think if you take the Mag Seven the last few years, take the Mag Seven out of the S&P 500, it’s only been averaging about under 8% a year. That means as this market starts to broaden out, there’s enormous opportunities in traditional industries, right? Consumer cyclicals is a huge place. There can be energy. We very much like banking. We like it quite a bit. So we wouldn’t double down on the Magnificent Seven right now. AM: If we’re holding Mag Seven in 2025, then what picks do you have for retail investors? CM: A couple that we like very much are Constellation Energy (CEG). We love it. And it’s simple because it’s a broadbased energy company. We like energy as a whole, and a lot of the larger funds are holding Constellation Energy. Interestingly, they dipped their toe in both pools because they signed a large deal with Microsoft (MSFT) recently to supply energy for for all the AI data centers. That means that they are guaranteed about a 30% runup in their stock over the next 12 months, in our opinion. So we like Constellation Energy quite a bit. Well, there’s a mining company we were talking about earlier, Newmark Mining. We love them. They’re doing copper, they’re doing gold. They’re one of the largest gold and copper miners in the world. Gold is a hedge against inflation, of course. We’re not really worried about the inflation play right now. What we’re really thinking about is the uses of gold and copper and manufacturing. AM: And you mentioned financial services, too. What picks do you have? CM: We like American Express (AXP) quite a bit. We like MasterCard (MA), not as much as we like American Express. And generally we don’t like the regional banks. The regional banks are scaring us a little bit. And here’s why. There’s about a trillion dollars of commercial leases that are coming due. Interest rates haven’t been cut enough yet and unfortunately we have some concerns. Our rush hour traffic’s lower because people just aren’t coming into town as much. Even though we are forcing companies to come back downtown. We see some of these buildings refinancing at higher rates with lower occupancy as a potential real headwind. You know, that’s a term we use, ‘headwind’. We don’t want to say potential crash, but a ‘headwind’ for the market. Unlikely that that would bring the market down and stop all this momentum. Therefore, we like the big banks, the big banks are continuing to get bigger. And we think most of the big banks that we’re used to are undervalued by about 10-12% this year. Why take on undue risk when you have that kind of runup in a very predictable stock. AM: Fascinating. So in your book, there are a lot of tips on how people can invest based on their values. What’s one thing you could tell our audience today? CM: I would say be informed. I think your audience knows how to use the internet as well as anybody does, use these tools that are out there now. I would say technology is the king and demand of your advisors, if this is important to me, I need you to prove to me how you’re vetting this appropriately.

Title: BlackRock, Weinstein Reach Truce in Spat on Closed-End Funds

(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. stuck agreements with Boaz Weinstein’s Saba Capital Management that will end the activist-hedge fund’s battle with BlackRock over dozens of closed-end funds whose share prices had tumbled deeply below the value of their underlying assets. Most Read from Bloomberg Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump What LA’s Fires Mean for the City’s Housing Shortage NY’s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark As part of the deal, BlackRock agreed to repurchase a big chunk of the shares in two of its largest closed-end funds at a price close to their net asset values — 50% of outstanding shares in the $1.8 billion Innovation and Growth Term Trust (ticker BIGZ) and 40% of the $1.7 billion Health Sciences Term Trust (ticker BMEZ). Saba also entered so-called standstill agreements with 48 other BlackRock funds, according to regulatory filings. BIGZ and BMEZ, which had both had traded at deep discounts in the past, jumped more than 6% on the Tuesday proposals. The two tender offers, at a price of 99.5% of of their net asset values could potentially deliver more than $1.5 billion to shareholders, based on calculation by Bloomberg. Weinstein wrote in a post on X that the changes were made after “constructive discussions with BlackRock” and that “by committing to shareholder-friendly initiatives, liquidity events and governance enhancements, value can be unlocked for all investors.” Saba has spent years and billions of dollars buying up closed-end funds run by BlackRock and other big asset managers after their share prices dipped sharply below the value of the assets they hold, a trading anomaly that Saba said was harming investors. It mounted proxy fights and court battles in a bid to pressure the firms to take steps to erase that gap, including through tender offers to buy back the stock. Last year, Boaz ran proxy fights at 10 BlackRock funds with mixed outcomes. It also sued BlackRock’s ESG Capital Allocation Term Trust (ticker ECAT) over its voting bylaws, which is still subject to litigation in a federal court. Weinstein’s fights center around funds that buy income-producing assets, like junk bonds, municipal debt or dividend-paying stocks, that were hit hard when the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates and investors were looking to bail out. With their performances trailing market benchmarks, the discounted trading prices saddled investors with losses if they sold. The hedge fund manager is bringing a similar playbook to UK’s investment-trust industry and attempting to seize control of a bunch of those firms, including two trusts run by Janus Henderson Group Plc.

Nvidia (NVDA-0.61%) reclaimed its title as the world’s most valuable public company on Tuesday as Apple’s (AAPL-0.30%) shares slid. The chipmaker’s stock was up about 2.4% during mid-day trading Tuesday, pushing its market cap to $3.45 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple saw its shares fall by almost 4%, landing its market cap at $3.33 trillion. The iPhone maker’s shares are down by more than 9% so far this year, while Nvidia’s shares are up 2%. Jefferies (JEF-1.20%) analysts downgraded Apple’s rating to “Underperform” in a note Tuesday morning, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance. Apple’s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to “be weak,” Jefferies said, “because there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.” Following Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it is “cautious” over demand for Apple’s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone — part of the SE series of smaller iPhones — is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and artificial intelligence capabilities powered by Apple Intelligence. Analysts also noted that the SE 4 is expected to have one rear camera, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro have three cameras. “As Apple Intelligence has yet to gain traction with consumers, a used iPhone 13 would be an attractive option to some consumers especially [because] the selling price could potentially be lower than that of SE4,” Jefferies analysts said in the note. Meanwhile, iPhone shipments were down by around 4% year over year in the quarter ending in December, Jefferies said, citing data from the International Data Corporation. Jefferies added that supply chain checks suggest iPhone sales in China were down by a percentage in the “high teens” in the quarter, leading the firm to cut iPhone shipment growth expectations.

Title: Did Billionaire Chen Tianqiao Dump or Bet on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Chen Tianqiao Dumped 3 Tech Stocks and Betting On These 4 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks. Chen Tianqiao is a prominent Chinese entrepreneur and investor, best known for founding Shanda Interactive Entertainment, one of the leading internet and gaming companies in China during the early 2000s. Tianqiao also heads Shanda Asset Management, a hedge fund that managed more than $1.7 billion in 13F securities at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Through his innovative approach to technology and business, Chen has become one of the pioneers of the online gaming industry and a significant figure in the global tech and neuroscience communities. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Chen Tianqiao was born in 1973 in the Zhejiang province of China. Raised in a modest family, he excelled academically and earned admission to Fudan University, one of the top institutions in the Asian country, where he studied economics. His early years were marked by a strong interest in technology and business, which would later define his career. After graduation, Chen began his career in the investment arm of the state-owned conglomerate Jinjiang Group, where he honed his business and financial skills. However, his entrepreneurial ambitions led him to leave the corporate world and pursue opportunities in the burgeoning internet industry. In 1999, Chen co-founded Shanda Interactive Entertainment with his wife, Luo Qianqian, and younger brother, Chen Danian. The company initially focused on developing and distributing multimedia content but quickly shifted its focus to online gaming. In 2004, Shanda became the first Chinese online gaming company to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange, raising $152 million. By the mid-2000s, Chen was one of the richest individuals in China, with Forbes naming him one of the wealthiest self-made billionaires under 40. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Shanda Asset Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 Shanda Asset Management's Stake: $121.4 million NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The company's investment potential is driven by following several factors. To begin with, the investors may consider the company’s financial growth as a top factor. As illustrated in the report of the third quarter of 2024, GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per diluted share was 0.78 dollars, up 16% from the previous quarter and up 111% from a year ago. Additionally, the company’s quarterly net income was 19.3 billion dollars, up 16% from the second quarter and up 112% from a year ago. The second most compelling factor that may attract investment is the launch of its project DIGITS, the world’s smallest AI supercomputer capable of running 200B-parameter models. Moreover, the firm has launched the NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform of APIs, SDKs, and services that enable developers to integrate OpenUSD, NVIDIA RTX rendering technologies, and generative AI into existing software tools and simulation workflows for industrial and robotic use cases. Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Billionaire Chen Tianqiao dumped and bet on. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Raised in a modest family, he excelled academically and earned admission to Fudan University, one of the top institutions in the Asian country, where he studied economics. His early years were marked by a strong interest in technology and business, which would later define his career. After graduation, Chen began his career in the investment arm of the state-owned conglomerate Jinjiang Group, where he honed his business and financial skills. However, his entrepreneurial ambitions led him to leave the corporate world and pursue opportunities in the burgeoning internet industry. In 1999, Chen co-founded Shanda Interactive Entertainment with his wife, Luo Qianqian, and younger brother, Chen Danian. The company initially focused on developing and distributing multimedia content but quickly shifted its focus to online gaming. In 2004, Shanda became the first Chinese online gaming company to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange, raising $152 million. By the mid-2000s, Chen was one of the richest individuals in China, with Forbes naming him one of the wealthiest self-made billionaires under 40.

Additionally, the company’s quarterly net income was 19.3 billion dollars, up 16% from the second quarter and up 112% from a year ago. The second most compelling factor that may attract investment is the launch of its project DIGITS, the world’s smallest AI supercomputer capable of running 200B-parameter models. Moreover, the firm has launched the NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform of APIs, SDKs, and services that enable developers to integrate OpenUSD, NVIDIA RTX rendering technologies, and generative AI into existing software tools and simulation workflows for industrial and robotic use cases. Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Billionaire Chen Tianqiao dumped and bet on.

Subscribe here to receive future editions. I'm back in New York City after spending nearly a week in San Francisco for the annual JPMorgan Health Care Conference – the largest gathering in the U.S. of biotech and pharma execs, investors and analysts (and health reporters, of course). The week featured questions about the incoming Trump administration, updates on business outlooks and drug portfolios, heightened security on the ground and, for the first time in recent memory, sunny weather in San Francisco. The news kept coming all week, even after the conference ended mid-Thursday. The Biden administration on Friday announced the next 15 drugs included in Medicare price negotiations, which include Novo Nordisk's blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic and its obesity counterpart Wegovy. But after companies announced a handful of deals last week, I'll zero in on some takeaways for M&A activity in the industry in 2025. M&A appears to be off to a good start this year. But the question is whether it will last. Some of the deals announced during the conference boosted optimism, particularly Johnson & Johnson's proposed $14.6 billion buyout of Intra-Cellular Therapies. That appears to be the biggest transaction we've seen in the pharmaceutical industry since 2023. That agreement came amid a wave of smaller deals from GSK, Eli Lilly and lesser known radiopharmaceutical companies. "That's five deals in one and a half business days," Stifel analyst Tim Opler said in an email to clients last week. "This is going to be a very different year for M&A than 2024." Last year was marked by smaller and smarter deals in the pharmaceutical industry, according to EY's M&A Firepower report released last week. Big pharma sought deals with lower price tags for products and companies in earlier development, which could pay off more handsomely in the long run. While this year has started off with more activity, the report pointed to potential restraints on M&A in 2025: Ongoing margin pressure on biopharma companies is still "reducing the appetite for big spending," and the most prized acquisition targets in the industry are still commanding high premiums in the market, among other factors that could dampen transactions. That tracks for some large pharma companies. During a presentation at the conference after J&J announced its Intra-Cellular Therapies deal, J&J CEO Joaquin Duato said "for us, larger deals are more outliers." "The majority of the value that we create is through smaller deals and partnerships where we can use our scale," Duato said, pointing to the 75 smaller deals that J&J inked last year. But the EY report said there are "strong structural reasons to expect a return to dealmaking," including the industry's $1.3 trillion in dealmaking "firepower," which refers to the ability to fund transactions and make deals. Large pharma companies are also bracing for upcoming drug patent expirations that could wipe out $300 billion in revenues by 2028, putting more pressure on them to offset losses with new products. Pfizer, for example, faces a wave of patent losses over the next few years that could threaten some $17 billion to $18 billion in annual sales, the company's CEO Albert Bourla said during a presentation at the conference. But Bourla said the company's series of deals in recent years, such as its acquisition of cancer drug developer Seagen, should help offset those losses. The Trump administration could also offer "significant tailwinds" to the industry by cutting corporate taxes or changing FTC policy "as part of a general deregulatory shift," according to the EY report. But we'll have to see how this all plays out later this year. Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at annikakim.constantino@nbcuni.com. Now that JPM has come to a close, 2025 is officially underway for the health-care sector. But we can't dive into the year ahead without first taking a look at the venture funding landscape for digital health in 2024. On the whole, it was a year of the haves and the have nots. Digital health startups in the U.S. raised $10.1 billion across 497 deals last year, according to a new report from Rock Health. That total fell from $10.8 billion in 2023, and is about in line with the $8.2 billion raised prior to the pandemic in 2019 when adjusting for inflation. Digital health M&A hit a decade low last year, as the segment notched just 118 deals. An increase in early-stage fundraising activity, along with smaller late-stage deals, account for the lower investment in 2024, Rock Health said. This could spell trouble for later-stage startups that raised money at sky-high valuations during Covid, potentially pushing them toward acquisitions or shuttering operations entirely in 2025. Additionally, large megafunds, health-systems and tech companies held an outsized amount of influence over digital health in 2024, Rock Health said. Venture firms Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst, which secured 20% of all committed LP capital in the U.S. in 2024, were the sector's top investors, for instance. And while artificial intelligence was still a hot investment area within digital health, it's becoming harder for startups to beat out large incumbents. Rock Health said tech companies like Microsoft that can afford to build and maintain expensive foundation models pulled ahead in health-care AI, as did organizations like Epic that can deploy applications of those models on an enterprise-wide scale. There's still room for smaller AI startups to find a niche within health care, but Rock Health said they'll need to "think carefully about their positioning." "These dual trends—early-stage startup activity amidst big moves by large healthcare players—have created a David and Goliath dynamic in the healthcare innovation landscape," Rock Health said. If JPM was any indication, we're in for another interesting year in digital health. We'll see what 2025 has in store. Read the full report here.

Title: Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid shares fall as Trump kicks off his anti-EV agenda

The Detroit automakers’ shares are rising Tuesday while their fully-electric rivals saw their stocks fall as President Donald Trump began tearing into his predecessor’s pro-EV moves. “We will end the Green New Deal, and we will revoke the electric-vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American auto workers,” Trump said in his inaugural address. “You’ll be able to buy the car of your choice.” Later on Monday, he issued an executive order to eliminate the “EV mandate, terminate state emissions rules that limit the sale of gasoline-powered cars, and consider eliminating any subsidies for EVs. There is no nationwide U.S. electric-vehicle mandate, but some states, led by California, have implemented their own rules to phase out fossil fuel-powered vehicles, while the Environmental Protection Agency has issued a rule limiting tailpipe emissions. Trump also directed agencies to stop handing out funds tied to Former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which provided funding for EVs and other clean energy infrastructure. More than $82.5 billion has been allocated to 164 EV-related projects, creating 63,659 jobs, through the IRA, according to E2's investment tracker. The president is also expected to scrap the IRA’s $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers, which has helped keep costs down and boost sales for automakers. Electric truck maker Rivian’s (RIVN-3.66%) stock fell by more than 6%, while luxury EV maker Lucid’s (LCID-0.56%) shares dropped by more than 4%. Tesla (TSLA-0.82%), despite Elon Musk’s close relationship with Trump and a price target raise from Piper Sandler, fell almost 3%. “Not sure how the math works for elimination of the EV credit to be bullish,” for Tesla, the Future Fund Managing Partner Gary Black wrote Monday. Black noted that Germany and France’s moves to end their EV tax credits contributed to Tesla’s sales volumes falling 41% and 34%, respectively, on an annual basis. The stock may also be down because of Musk’s alignment with Trump, as well as reactions to a gesture he made while speaking at Trump’s inauguration parade on Monday. Tesla lost $15 billion in brand value in 2024, according to a new report, partially due to Musk’s political rhetoric and brash behavior. The Detroit automakers will also be affected by Trump’s EV plans, but have their gas-powered and hybrid portfolios — which still account for most of their sales — to fall back on. Ford Motor Co. (F+0.95%) and Stellantis (STLA+0.65%) shares are up by almost 2% and more than 2%, respectively. General Motors (GM+2.33%) shares gained almost 5% in trading Tuesday, partially boosted by an upgrade from a “hold” rating to “buy” from Deutsche Bank (DB+2.01%). Analysts led by Edison Yu say that GM’s recent moves to close down its Cruise self-driving unit and restructure its China business, along with its recent buybacks, give them confidence in the company. “While there are concerns about the cycle and potential policies of the new Trump administration, our view is that these risks are already very well-known, and there’s room for positive surprises,” the analysts wrote on Tuesday. One such surprise could be Trump declining to follow through on his plans to slap Canadian and Mexican imports with tariffs, which would affect most automakers.

Title: As Trump Takes the Wheel, Big Corporations Extricate From DEI, Climate Programs

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/21/2025 9:46:07 AM PST by george76 ‘A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,’ Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said.. After years of applying the progressive environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ideological framework to their corporations, executives appear to now be realizing that these programs could be driving their companies into a legal and financial wall. The past year has seen a growing list of Fortune 500 companies announcing that they are dropping race- and gender-based programs for their employees and pulling out of global net zero climate clubs. Companies that have announced they are canceling or dialing back their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs include Meta, Walmart, Ford, McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, John Deere, Tractor Supply Company, Lowe’s, Molson Coors, Nissan, Toyota, and Stanley Black & Decker. In addition, within weeks of the 2024 election, six of the largest U.S. banks—Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley—dropped out of the U.N.-sponsored Net-Zero Banking Alliance. On Jan. 13, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAMi) announced that it would suspend its activities after investor giant BlackRock announced its withdrawal from the club on Jan. 9. These departures followed in the wake of half of the members of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance quitting that organization in 2023. This has led many to conclude that the ESG movement is rapidly coming to an end. “ESG and DEI are both on death watch,” Daniel Cameron, former Kentucky attorney general and current CEO of the nonprofit 1792 Exchange, told The Epoch Times. “I think it’s because companies are realizing that a lot of the country just want our corporate community to focus on creating and developing great products and providing great service, rather than pushing or preaching a partisan agenda,” he said. Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds.

Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology.

The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors.

Companies that have announced they are canceling or dialing back their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs include Meta, Walmart, Ford, McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, John Deere, Tractor Supply Company, Lowe’s, Molson Coors, Nissan, Toyota, and Stanley Black & Decker. In addition, within weeks of the 2024 election, six of the largest U.S. banks—Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley—dropped out of the U.N.-sponsored Net-Zero Banking Alliance. On Jan. 13, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAMi) announced that it would suspend its activities after investor giant BlackRock announced its withdrawal from the club on Jan. 9. These departures followed in the wake of half of the members of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance quitting that organization in 2023. This has led many to conclude that the ESG movement is rapidly coming to an end. “ESG and DEI are both on death watch,” Daniel Cameron, former Kentucky attorney general and current CEO of the nonprofit 1792 Exchange, told The Epoch Times. “I think it’s because companies are realizing that a lot of the country just want our corporate community to focus on creating and developing great products and providing great service, rather than pushing or preaching a partisan agenda,” he said. Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep.

On Jan. 13, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAMi) announced that it would suspend its activities after investor giant BlackRock announced its withdrawal from the club on Jan. 9. These departures followed in the wake of half of the members of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance quitting that organization in 2023. This has led many to conclude that the ESG movement is rapidly coming to an end. “ESG and DEI are both on death watch,” Daniel Cameron, former Kentucky attorney general and current CEO of the nonprofit 1792 Exchange, told The Epoch Times. “I think it’s because companies are realizing that a lot of the country just want our corporate community to focus on creating and developing great products and providing great service, rather than pushing or preaching a partisan agenda,” he said. Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’..

The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ...

Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ...

Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ...

Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ...

The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Posted on 01/21/2025 9:46:07 AM PST by george76 ‘A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,’ Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said.. After years of applying the progressive environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ideological framework to their corporations, executives appear to now be realizing that these programs could be driving their companies into a legal and financial wall. The past year has seen a growing list of Fortune 500 companies announcing that they are dropping race- and gender-based programs for their employees and pulling out of global net zero climate clubs. Companies that have announced they are canceling or dialing back their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs include Meta, Walmart, Ford, McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, John Deere, Tractor Supply Company, Lowe’s, Molson Coors, Nissan, Toyota, and Stanley Black & Decker. In addition, within weeks of the 2024 election, six of the largest U.S. banks—Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley—dropped out of the U.N.-sponsored Net-Zero Banking Alliance. On Jan. 13, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAMi) announced that it would suspend its activities after investor giant BlackRock announced its withdrawal from the club on Jan. 9. These departures followed in the wake of half of the members of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance quitting that organization in 2023. This has led many to conclude that the ESG movement is rapidly coming to an end. “ESG and DEI are both on death watch,” Daniel Cameron, former Kentucky attorney general and current CEO of the nonprofit 1792 Exchange, told The Epoch Times. “I think it’s because companies are realizing that a lot of the country just want our corporate community to focus on creating and developing great products and providing great service, rather than pushing or preaching a partisan agenda,” he said. Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The past year has seen a growing list of Fortune 500 companies announcing that they are dropping race- and gender-based programs for their employees and pulling out of global net zero climate clubs. Companies that have announced they are canceling or dialing back their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs include Meta, Walmart, Ford, McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, John Deere, Tractor Supply Company, Lowe’s, Molson Coors, Nissan, Toyota, and Stanley Black & Decker. In addition, within weeks of the 2024 election, six of the largest U.S. banks—Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley—dropped out of the U.N.-sponsored Net-Zero Banking Alliance. On Jan. 13, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAMi) announced that it would suspend its activities after investor giant BlackRock announced its withdrawal from the club on Jan. 9. These departures followed in the wake of half of the members of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance quitting that organization in 2023. This has led many to conclude that the ESG movement is rapidly coming to an end. “ESG and DEI are both on death watch,” Daniel Cameron, former Kentucky attorney general and current CEO of the nonprofit 1792 Exchange, told The Epoch Times. “I think it’s because companies are realizing that a lot of the country just want our corporate community to focus on creating and developing great products and providing great service, rather than pushing or preaching a partisan agenda,” he said. Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds.

On Jan. 13, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAMi) announced that it would suspend its activities after investor giant BlackRock announced its withdrawal from the club on Jan. 9. These departures followed in the wake of half of the members of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance quitting that organization in 2023. This has led many to conclude that the ESG movement is rapidly coming to an end. “ESG and DEI are both on death watch,” Daniel Cameron, former Kentucky attorney general and current CEO of the nonprofit 1792 Exchange, told The Epoch Times. “I think it’s because companies are realizing that a lot of the country just want our corporate community to focus on creating and developing great products and providing great service, rather than pushing or preaching a partisan agenda,” he said. Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Republican victories in the November 2024 elections will likely spark more defections from the progressive corporate movement. “The election of Donald Trump put backers of ESG on notice, and I believe the recent departure by several major banks and asset managers from the U.N.’s anti-fossil fuel cartel confirms that the broader ESG movement is on life-support,” Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ...

But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told The Epoch Times. ... In his former role as state treasurer of West Virginia, Moore was among the first to divest state funds from BlackRock over what he charged was the firm’s support for ESG policies. The Nasdaq Stock Market on Jan. 16 filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to withdraw its 2021 diversity rule after an appeals court recently struck it down. The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies? The ESG ideology originated at the United Nations in 2004 as a way to get private companies on board with progressive climate and social goals known as the U.N.’s “Sustainable Development Goals.” ... The world’s savings and investments are heavily concentrated in the hands of just a few fund managers, the largest of which, called the “Big Three,” are BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, which collectively manage more than $20 trillion in assets largely through their index funds. By comparison, the United States’ GDP is approximately $29 trillion. ... Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’..

Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

The Nasdaq rule had required companies listed on the exchange to have at least two “diverse” board members, including “at least one director who self-identifies as a female” and one who “self-identifies as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, two or more races or ethnicities, or as LGBTQ+.” Is ESG Good for Companies?

But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Added to this are the United States’ largest municipal retirement funds, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, and New York City and state pension funds, which have also pressured companies to embrace ESG ideology. These fund managers joined U.N.-sponsored net zero alliances, such as NZAMi and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance—which pledged to reduce the use of fossil fuels—as well as other activist organizations such as Climate Action 100+. ... The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ...

The Biden administration also threw its weight behind the ESG movement. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to “advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce.” In 2022, the U.S. Labor Department altered its rules to allow asset managers of private Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pensions to consider “climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors” when investing pension money. Previously, under the first Trump administration, ERISA fund managers could only consider pecuniary factors that would maximize returns to pensioners. In addition, the SEC in March 2024 implemented what became known as the “green accounting” rule, which required all listed companies to audit and document their “climate-related risks,” their carbon dioxide emissions, and their strategies for reducing them. ... ‘The Beginning of the End’.. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to end DEI throughout the federal government and in federally funded colleges, and in anticipation, the FBI reportedly closed its Office of Diversity and Inclusion in December 2024. The incoming administration is also likely to reverse the SEC’s green accounting rule and reinstate its previous policies that ban non-pecuniary investing of ERISA pension funds. But according to ESG critics, the ideology still has life in it. ... “It’s the beginning of the end,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Epoch Times. “The momentum has shifted and I don’t see it coming back, but there’s still a lot of work to do. “Even with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, and [NZAMi] shutting down operations, you still have a number of these firms, including BlackRock, who have not repudiated their firm’s individual commitment to pushing net zero.” ... “We already saw the customer and employee backlash happen with companies like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, etc. Now attention is being placed on legal and regulatory risks, especially with the American Airlines ruling that its 401(k) plans violate ERISA fiduciary duties.” .... On Jan. 13, a U.S. district court ruled that American Airlines had mishandled its employees’ retirement funds by allowing fund managers to pursue ESG investments. At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

At the height of the ESG movement, many executives acted in lockstep, seemingly believing that “safety in numbers” shielded them from legal action, analysts said. But with every company that steps away from ESG ideology, those that remain committed are more exposed to employee and investor lawsuits and enforcement actions from federal and state officials, ... every company that abandons its ESG or DEI policies “makes it harder for the remaining companies to toe the line.” In December 2023, Skrmetti brought a consumer-protection suit against BlackRock, alleging that the firm had misled Tennessee consumers regarding the extent to which ESG factors affected its investment strategies. ... The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race.

The legal risks include violation of civil rights laws, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws, experts said. Following the Supreme Court ruling in October 2022 that race-based admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violated U.S. civil rights laws, 13 state attorneys general penned a letter to the United States’ largest companies, stating, “the Supreme Court’s recent decision should place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.” The letter warned that “if your company previously resorted to racial preferences or naked quotas to offset its bigotry, that discriminatory path is now definitively closed.” Corporate attorneys are beginning to push companies to acknowledge and disclose these risks to investors. In its September 2023 10-K filing with the SEC, for example, The Walt Disney Company listed among its risk factors the fact that “consumers’ perceptions of [Disney’s] position on matters of public interest, including ... efforts to achieve certain ... environmental and social goals, often differ widely and present risks to [Disney’s] reputation and brands.” ... This disclosure followed a significant decline in Disney’s sales and share price following the company’s campaign against a Florida parents’ rights law that barred teachers in grades K–3 from discussing sexual topics with students, as well as revelations that company producers were routinely putting controversial sexual themes into children’s content. In November 2023, shareholders sued Target and its board of directors, alleging that they “betrayed both Target’s core customer base of working families and its investors by making false and misleading statements about Target’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.” And in 2023, a white Starbucks employee was awarded $25 million when the company was found to have fired her because of her race. Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

Companies put themselves at risk with race-based training and other policies, as these practices open them up to employee lawsuits for creating a hostile work environment, Hild said. “Where were their compliance attorneys on this stuff?” he said. “I think it raises the question of whether a lot of these companies need to take a look at their compliance departments and have some firings on that front.” Anticipating that the Trump administration will take a tougher approach to enforcing civil rights and antitrust laws regarding ESG, many companies are now racing to get their policies in line with these laws. “A lot of companies got way out over their skis on this, but the law hasn’t changed,” Skrmetti said. “You’re going to see a lot of litigation going forward, and that’s why I think you’re seeing a lot of companies move very, very quickly to try to get on the right side of the law before the Trump administration begins enforcing these laws that have been on the books for a very long time. “We are a country of individual Americans, and when you put people in buckets based on something as trivial as the color of their skin and treat some people differently than others, it’s evil,” he said.

January 21, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming February 18, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (“Kaspi” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: KSPI) securities between January 19, 2024 and September 19, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR KASPI INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On September 19, 2024, Culper Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Kaspi "systematically misled U.S. investors and regulators in its repeated claims – especially ahead of the Company’s January 2024 NASDAQ listing – that the Company has zero exposure to Russia." The Culper Research report alleges that, in fact "Russia has contributed materially to Kaspi's reported growth." On this news, Kaspi’s stock price fell $19.20, or 16.1%, to close at $99.81 per share on September 19, 2024, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Kaspi continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Kaspi securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than February 18, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Your one-stop shop for data visualizations that explain complicated and cool stuff in digestible ways. top spots The tech industry has seen some brutal layoffs in recent years — but, if employee reviews are anything to go by, Big Tech companies are at least keeping their existing workers happy. To uncover the best states and cities for Big Tech employees, Switch On Business analyzed Glassdoor employee reviews for Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta published between January 2023 and October 2024, then ranked companies' locations by average employee rating. The best city for Apple workers was Palo Alto, California, where employee ratings average at 4.48 out of five. The biggest disparity between the highest- and lowest-rated cities belonged to Amazon. The company's employees gave Herndon, Virginia, an average rating of 4.24, compared to just 2.73 in Buena Park, California. There wasn't a single US location where Google or Microsoft employees rated their experience below 4.0, on average. Meta's best state for workers was Florida (4.29), while the worst-rated was California (3.90). When it comes to the lowest-rated places for tech workers, company headquarters were often among the spots with the poorest employee reviews. Click images to enlarge Via Switch On Business.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks traded in the green on Tuesday, but tech lagged as investors digested President Donald Trump's first policy moves, with future tariffs on Mexico and Canada front of mind. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively. But the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was broadly flat as the likes of Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) struggled. Wall Street is bracing for volatility as the new president storms ahead with executive orders and actions, with energy and trade center stage. It's the first day of trading in Trump's second term, as US markets were closed Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Markets got a dose of relief as Trump held off from firing off the barrage of universal tariff hikes expected by many on his first day in office. China got a surprise reprieve as Trump failed to act on promised high duties on its imports. US stock futures rose, and the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) pulled back from a near two-year high on Monday. But the mood shifted after Trump said later in the day that he was looking at imposing 25% duties for Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 1. And Chinese stocks (000300.SS) closed out Tuesday with only slight gains, suggesting investors aren't convinced that a US-China reset is coming to avert a trade war. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell about 4 basis points to around 4.57% early on Tuesday, recovering somewhat from a deeper drop in Asia trading. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has been on a ride, rising to a record higher above $109,000 on Monday as Trump was sworn in and the new president issued an official TRUMP "meme coin" token. The leading digital currency then fell steeply early Tuesday after a hoped-for pro-crypto push failed to appear in the first policy actions. It was trading lower but still above $103,000 at last check. The next batch of quarterly earnings will provide more food for thought for investors. Netflix (NFLX) is expected to deliver strong results when it reports after the bell. Meanwhile, earnings at Charles Schwab (SCHW) soared nearly 50% as trading activity climbed by double digits. D.R. Horton (DHI) also beat expectations despite a soft housing market, while 3M Company (MMM) issued optimistic full-year guidance, driven by organic sales growth. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Tesla (TSLA) stock sank more than 4% in early trading Tuesday, reversing premarket gains on the first trading day since the inauguration of Donald Trump as the president scrapped a pro-EV policy put into place by his predecessor. On his first day in office, Trump wasted no time shedding the skin of the outgoing administration, revoking 78 executive orders made by former Democratic President Joe Biden during his tenure. One of those Biden-era policies that was revoked mandated that half of the new US cars manufactured be electric by 2030. Other EV stocks fell on the news. Lucid (LCID) tumbled nearly 7% while Rivian (RIVN) slid 5%. Meanwhile, General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) stocks were up. US stocks climbed across the board on Tuesday as investors digested President Donald Trump's first wave of executive orders, with future tariffs on China and Mexico at the forefront of stock traders' minds. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also climbed about 0.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and other tech megacaps boosted the overall index. Economic data: No notable economic data releases. Earnings: Netflix (NFLX), 3M Company (MMM), Capital One (COF), Charles Schwab (SCHW), D.R. Horton (DHI), KeyCorp (KEY), Interactive Brokers Group (IBKR), United Airlines (UAL), Zions Bancorporation (ZION) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: BofA chief: The Fed may have to respond to Trump Bitcoin holds retreat as Trump omits crypto from Day 1 orders Apple's iPhone sales in China plunged 18% in holiday quarter Trump eyes historic 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico Investors get set for stock laggards to rally on Trump bets: BofA 3M stock rises as Q4 profit beats estimates on strong demand Huawei seeks to grab market share in AI chips from Nvidia in China Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Sure, I’d love to work in an office with ‘masculine energy’
URL: https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2025/01/21/sure-i-d-love-work-office-with-masculine-energy
Time Published: 2025-01-21T15:15:00Z

Advertisement January 21, 2025 | 8 min read Listen to article 4 min ​Freelance creative Julie Seal, among other things, used to work at Meta. She was particularly interested in CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s call for “masculine energy” in the workplace. Here, she explores the good and the bad aspects of what that could mean. I’d love to work in a place with masculine energy. “Sheryl hired great people and taught me how to run a company. She deserves credit for so much of what Meta is today,” said Zuckerberg in 2024. A few months later, he’s saying his former colleague is responsible for the diversity and the ‘culture issue’ brought about by Sheryl’s ‘feminine energy.’ But I think he’s right to do so. Personally, I would love to work in a company with ‘masculine energy.’ To plunge into the clichés, he could mean cutthroat and merciless, lunchtime arm wrestles and willy-swinging competitions, maybe actual shooting range target practice and MMA ‘team-building’ sessions, lunches of only red meat, protein shakes (or red meat protein shakes) and coffee with melted butter. Some of you will be more familiar with the more British version, office floors exchanging shouty ‘bants,’ copious lunchtime, after work, cheeky bottom-drawer booze-bonding and ‘man-up’ ‘mickey-taking.’ Maybe it’s like a dating app office I once went for a meeting at where there were photos of naked women on the walls, and the only female employees in hundreds were the high-heeled hot receptionists. (They wanted to attract more women to the app, hence my being invited to help them. Lol). Or maybe it’s more like the now disgraced fast-fashion mogul who I saw in a meeting publicly berate every member of his staff, including his son, before slipping his hand too far down my back a number of times on the way out. Or the ‘masculine energy’ I first experienced at work was when I worked for my dad in the school holidays from the age of eight. I valeted the cars he bought written off and did up, or we did painting and decorating. I worked 8-4pm every day and got £5 a week (and a daily fry up at a truck caff) for the pleasure. His masculine energy mainly meant being tight and saying very little of anything. Later, I experienced the ‘masculine energy’ of working in a very rough estate pub (underage at 16), where I was placed in the middle of the daily fights to ensure they’d stop as “nobody would punch the little blonde girl.” I learned how to deal with perving, leering, requests to take photos of my feet for a fetish mag, filthy comments constantly sprinkled around the commonplace violence. Advertisement When I ran my own pub at 20 (the youngest landlady the company ever had), the ‘masculine energy’ came from every delivery man who asked for the manager, incredulous and low-key furious it could be me. In advertising, the ‘masculine energy’ was different. This was a professional office environment, so the aggression was passive, with each of the three founders hating and trying to undermine each other in more sophisticated ways than pinning each other up against the toilet cistern. We collected their drugs from the local butcher along with the sausage roll order, and that helped fuel the ‘masculine energy’ nicely (while I was being sent laminated sticky photos of myself from a stalker who worked in the neighboring offices). In fact, Mark’s right, ‘feminine energy’ actually only really hit when I started work at Meta back in 2016. Sheryl seemed equally in charge, women were encouraged to ‘lean in’, they were respected and in positions of power, and people seemed to care about soft skills and the welfare of the workforce not just stock price. Advertisement One of my early managers, an American powerhouse of ambition mixed with kindness was something totally new to me then. My male manager was the same. He was understanding, he listened, he had empathy and a heart. And as a result, we felt valued, worked harder, and smarter. So weird, right? So when I say I would love to work in a company with ‘masculine energy,’ I guess I mean like the men I know and respect most. The masculinity that’s secure in itself enough to champion other people, women included. Or that’s fully-rounded enough to prioritize his family and home life and doesn’t ‘leave it all to the wife.’ That’s mature enough to only take the credit that’s due to them, rather than stealing glory or ideas from others. Or that’s brave enough to want to learn from people different from themselves. Or that’s worldly enough to listen as well as speak. Or that’s wise enough to know that gendering ‘energy’ is pretty old-fashioned in modern workplaces anyway. It’s not revolutionary to say that all the most successful workplaces are mixed. Mixed genders, backgrounds, skills, experiences, cultures, ambitions and styles. Yes, I’m going to throw you some actual provable data here (not my usual creative tack), but surely a ‘masculine energy’ thing to do is prove out a theory, right?

Title: GE Vernova hits new record high as RBC says Trump's order 'not impactful'

Investing.com -- GE Vernova's shares hit a new intraday high of over $407 on Tuesday, bolstered by investor confidence despite recent political developments. RBC Capital analysts reaffirmed their Outperform rating on the stock in a note Tuesday, emphasizing that President Trump's recent executive order on wind leasing and permitting is unlikely to have a significant impact on the company. The executive order temporarily bans offshore wind energy leases within the Outer Continental Shelf and pauses the issuance of new or renewed permits for onshore and offshore wind projects on federal lands, pending a review of federal wind leasing and permitting practices. However, RBC noted that only about 5% of the total utility-scale wind energy capacity in the U.S. comes from facilities on public lands. "We do not believe the executive order is of material significance," RBC analysts wrote. "We do not believe the announcement will have a material impact on GEV, given the limited exposure to offshore wind in the U.S. and limited onshore wind development on Federal land." The executive order aligns with President Trump's campaign promises to foster a reliable energy economy, citing legal deficiencies as the rationale for the ban. Despite this, RBC maintains a neutral sentiment on the broader implications for GE Vernova and reiterated its price target of $376 ib the stock.

January 21, 2025 08:00 ET | Source: Resilinc Resilinc MILPITAS, CA, Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Resilinc, the leading provider of supply chain resiliency solutions, is sharing exclusive new data revealing the top drivers of supply chain disruptions for 2024. The data compiled by Resilinc’s EventWatchAI, a 24/7 risk monitoring database, reveals that overall disruptions to global supply chains increased 38% from the previous year. The top five disruptions for 2024 include: Factory fires maintained their position as the number one disruption for the sixth consecutive year, with 2,299 disruption alerts issued. Fortunately, this number is down 20% from the previous year and has declined 36% from the record high in 2022. Labor disruptions made it into the top five list for the second year in a row, jumping up to the second spot with a 47% year-over-year increase. Labor issues played a major role in impacting most industries in the U.S. and globally, including company and site-level strikes, national strikes, labor protests, and layoffs. From the ILA U.S. port strike, impacting over 47,000 workers, and the Canadian rail strike to major layoffs at tech giants Intel, Dell, and Amazon, labor disruptions continued its streak as a key risk area for 2024. Financial risk areas, including business sales, leadership transitions, and mergers and acquisitions, rounded out the top five disruptions for 2024. While business sales climbed a steady 17% YoY, leadership transitions surged 95% last year. Several notable transitions included leadership changes at Boeing, Nestlé, Pfizer Limited, and Intel. While mergers and acquisitions saw a slight decline of 5%, they remained a top disruption for 2024. Though the number of disruption alerts increased overall, several risk areas experienced substantial year-over-year increases; for example, extreme weather jumped a dramatic 119%. Consistent with this trend, flood-related alerts surged by 214%, forest fires increased by 88%, and hurricanes/typhoons jumped by 101%, underscoring the growing impact of extreme weather risks. Other noteworthy trends highlighted in the data include a 146% rise in labor violations such as forced labor, poor working conditions, and health and safety violations, among others. Geopolitical risk alerts climbed 123% after a brief dip in 2023, and protests/riots saw an astounding 285% YoY increase, marking the largest growth increase of all risk events tracked by Resilinc. Regulatory change alerts, which include tariffs, changes in laws, environmental regulations, and bans, continued their upward trend with a 128% YoY increase. The five most disrupted industries included Life Sciences, Healthcare, General Manufacturing, High Tech, and Automotive, marking the fourth year in a row that these particular industries have been the most impacted. Of all the 22,522 EventWatchAI notifications sent, more than half (59%) were impactful enough to trigger the creation of a WarRoom—virtual platforms in the Resilinc dashboard where customers and their suppliers communicate and collaborate to assess and resolve disruptions—emphasizing that disruptions not only increased in 2024 but also had a heightened impact on global supply chains. Resilinc’s data is gathered by its 24/7 global event monitoring Artificial Intelligence, EventWatch AI, which collects information and monitors news on 400 different types of disruptions across 104 million sources including traditional news sources, social media platforms, wire services, videos, and government reports.

Title: Indie Agencies Seek a Competitive Edge as Talent Rejects WPP Office Mandate

Time Published: 2025-01-21T11:00:00Z

The stage is set! Advertisers, don't miss this cultural moment. ADWEEK House The Big Game is headed to New Orleans on February 7. RSVP. WPP made a bold move last week as the first major company in the ad industry to mandate that its 100,000-plus employees around the globe must return to the office four days per week. Five years on from the pandemic, there are legitimate reasons to return. Following in the footsteps of other major corporations, from Amazon to Toyota, WPP executives are eager to increase productivity, strengthen culture, and utilize dormant office space. But the decision has gotten under the skin of many employees who thrive working remotely or in a hybrid role, who have caregiving responsibilities at home—or who simply don’t appreciate being told where to work. A petition started by WPP employees on Change.org pushing back on the mandate has garnered more than 16,000 signatures so far. WPP is not the only holding company to enforce a return to office. Publicis employees were told to return three days per week, and dozens were laid off late last year for violating the policy. But none have pushed the mandate beyond three days in-person. That’s in contrast to big clients including JPMorgan Chase, Google, IBM, Apple, and Uber, which have ordered workers back to the office full time, with some threatening job cuts for non-compliance. Undoubtedly, the aggressive mandate will push some WPP staffers to seek job alternatives that are more flexible—and agencies who promote those policies may reap the rewards. “A-plus talent has choice,” Jared Belsky, CEO of independent media agency Acadia, told ADWEEK. “They want to work where they feel empowered and trusted. It’s hard to say ‘we trust you’ and then say ‘we are checking your badges to make sure you are here four times per week.’” Scott Brandon, CEO at agency Brandon, said that WPP’s policy reflects an old-school approach in an industry that thrives on evolution. “Rigid mandates risk alienating top performers who know their best work isn’t tied to a cubicle,” he said. “The backlash here isn’t surprising—people are looking for agencies that prioritize results and culture over arbitrary rules.” Jeff Levick, CEO of We Are Rosie, a fully remote company which offers brands flexible agency staffing, added that most return to office policies come from the CFO to justify expenses—but that creatives often work best with flexibility. Kandi Gongora, chief transformation and people officer at Goodway Group, added that office mandates will also limit holding companies from being able to hire the best talent across the country. “This ultimately leads to unsatisfied, unproductive employees in search of greater autonomy and far less access to incredible talent that exists outside of geographical barriers,” she said. While there are viable reasons for people to be in the office, agencies should prioritize those most impactful moments for people to come in, whether that’s to meet with clients, brainstorm with their teams, pitch new business, or build camaraderie, said Andrew Graff, CEO of independent agency Allen & Gerritson (A&G). Mandates must also be thought through carefully, particularly for agencies that downsized office space during the pandemic. WPP staffers are already grumbling about where they will work, as available desks and meeting rooms may be at a minimum, according The Drum. These are all kinks WPP will have to work out as it works through the logistics of an office return. Sasha Martens, founder of Sasha the Mensch, an international headhunting firm, believes independents stand to benefit most from WPP’s mandate, as staffers worry other holding companies will follow suit. “You’re more likely going to see some of the bigger companies say four days a week as well. What that does is open the door for more flexible and independent companies,” Martens told ADWEEK. With Omnicom’s takeover of IPG also spooking talent in fear of layoffs and priority changes, independent agencies could have an advantage. Indeed, Belsky said Acadia has “already seen resumes starting to trickle in, and I would predict we see more.” Levick agrees that flexible businesses like its own will benefit, as We Are Rosie has seen an uptick in resumes in response to return-to-office mandates in the past. “We’re entering this new marketplace where people can decide how they want to work, and if they want to go to the office,” he said. Agencies say a return to office will foster the creative alchemy that happens when teams work together in person. But those who are flexible can still come together with intention , without telling employees what to do. A&G redesigned its offices in Boston and Philadelphia with an eye on flexibility and community for that reason, inviting community members to share the space with it. “Your first space is your home. Your second space is the office. And the third space are those places where you gather and be social but still may conduct business,” said CEO Andrew Graff. “For an industry that is about creativity, I would think we could be a little bit more creative on how we think about these policies or mandates.” Agencies are businesses, and real estate is a substantial investment that they must justify. But disengaged talent can be just as costly in terms of lost innovation, diminished morale, and turnover. “The future of our industry isn’t about going back to the way things were—it’s about finding sustainable solutions that support strong outcomes and a workplace that works for everyone, wherever they are,” said Brooks Luquire, CEO at agency Luquire. Though “human interactions breed creativity,” according to Devin Reiter, president at agency Fortnight Collective, and most agencies are looking for some level of return, flexibility is now a big differentiator. “What the industry needs is balance,” said John Geletka, CXO and founder of Gelekta+. “People need to work together, and work hard, but then need the room after long nights of work to get some home-time and take care of their lives.” Study: Ad Agencies’ Return-to-Office Mandates Pose Hiring and Retention Challenges Kyle O’Brien is a staff reporter for Adweek and editor of AgencySpy.

Title: What To Expect From Bank Of America Stock In 2025?

Bank of America branch office, exterior view, New York City, New York, USA. (Photo by: GHI-Plexi ... [+] Images/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Bank of America’s stock (NYSE: BAC) posted a better-than-expected set of Q4 2024 earnings, led by stronger investment banking business and higher net interest income. Net profits more than doubled year-over-year to $6.67 billion, or $0.82 per share, while revenues were up 15% to $25.5 billion. Net interest income - the difference in between the interest banks earn on loans and pay for deposits - was up by 3% to $14.5 billion, coming in slightly ahead of estimates. The investment banking business was a particularly strong performer over Q4, with fees up 44% to $1.65 billion. Mergers and acquisitions activity has picked up from nearly a decade-low in 2023. Companies have also been focusing on issuing more debt and equity capital. Sales and trading revenue were up 10% over the quarter, with equities up 6% while fixed income, currencies, and commodities were up by an even stronger 13%. The broader U.S. banking sector has been faring well this earnings season led by rising stock markets which helped trading activity, softer interest rates, stronger dealmaking activity, and general positivity about the economy. For instance, Bank of America’s rival JPMorgan just reported record annual profits for 2024, while Goldman Sachs has also seen profits pick up after witnessing a post-Covid lull. Separately, in the cryptocurrency world, see Solana Price To $400 Next? The increase in BAC stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 50% in 2021, -24% in 2022, 5% in 2023, and 34% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could BAC face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? Looking ahead, things could get better. Higher interest rates in recent years weighed on lenders as they had to pay more interest to depositors. However, with the Fed easing rates since September, we could see this softening in the near term helping drive up loan demand while lowering the costs of deposits. Bank of America expects NII of as much as $14.6 billion for Q1 2025 and has indicated that the metric could grow sequentially every quarter this year, reaching as much as $15.7 billion by Q4. NII is an important metric for Bank Of America, as it has a large deposit base compared to rivals. Separately, the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency for a second term is also expected to benefit the financial sector at large. Investors are betting that the Trump administration’s focus on deregulation could translate into a more lenient approach to bank oversight versus the Biden administration, with antitrust-related rules also potentially easing. This could help banks boost their revenues, via higher deal volumes, and lending activity, as well as possibly lower compliance costs which could directly boost profitability. Trump has also been in favor of tax cuts, which could also help the bottom lines of banks such as Bank Of America. Overall, lower interest rates and more political certainty post-election could spur investment banking and M&A-related activity. Additionally, lower interest rates and more political certainty post-election could spur investment banking activity, with increased debt and equity issuances with M&A-related activity also poised to increase. Overall, at its current price of $47 per share, BAC is trading around the Trefis’ estimate for Bank of America’s valuation.

Title: The race for the next Ozempic is on

Time Published: 2025-01-21T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Two recent disappointing clinical trials of highly-anticipated weight-loss drugs have made it clear that it is too early to crown any winners in the race for the next generation of anti-obesity treatments. Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+1.20%) CagriSema and Amgen’s (AMGN+0.88%) MariTide both fell short of an expected 25% average weight-loss target in late-stage trials late last year, leaving investors frustrated and sending their stock prices tumbling. These setbacks have left the door wide open for other pharmaceutical companies racing to develop more potent weight-loss drugs. But it’s unclear how much better the next wave of treatments will be compared to those already on the market. These medications, known commonly as GLP-1 or incretin drugs, have taken the world by storm — especially in the United States. Popularized by Ozempic, these treatments mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, making them highly sought after for their weight-loss effects. Popular brand names of these treatments currently on the market include Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy, which shares the same active ingredient with Ozempic, and Eli Lilly’s (LLY+1.25%) Zepbound. The weight-loss drug boom has turned Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly into the world’s most valuable pharmaceutical companies, with sales skyrocketing in recent years. Morgan Stanley (MS+1.30%) projects the global market for these treatments could hit $105 billion by 2030. In the U.S. alone, nearly 10% of the population — 31.5 million people — are expected to be using them by 2035. With that much money at stake, it’s no surprise that drugmakers are already grinding to develop the blockbuster weight-loss drugs of tomorrow. Several pharma companies are developing weight-loss drugs promising faster results and, in some cases, less frequent injections — an improvement over weekly shots like Wegovy and Zepbound. To outperform the current options, these new treatments will need to deliver weight loss exceeding 20%, the average achieved with the highest dose of Zepbound. Novo Nordisk: The Danish pharma giant is developing a successor to its popular Ozempic medication. The company is betting that mimicking multiple hormones could deliver greater weight loss. CagriSema combines semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — with cagrilintide, a dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist, hence the name CagriSema. However, in December, Novo Nordisk said patients in a phase 3 clinical trial of the drug only lost an average of 22.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks on the medication. Eli Lilly: The American multinational is also developing a stronger weight-loss injection, retatrutide, which, in a small clinical trial, helped patients lose 17% of their weight in 24 weeks. “Retatrutide is really exciting because the amount of weight loss you have seen there was even beyond tirzepatide (the active ingredient in Zepbound),” president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health Patrik Jonsson told Quartz last year. He added this could help populations that need a greater level of weight loss. Amgen: The pharma giant said in November that its experimental weight-loss medication, MariTide, helped patients living with obesity or who are overweight lose an average of 20% of their weight in a 52-week trial. Amgen Chief Scientific Officer James E. Bradner previously told investors that MariTide is expected to be sold in a “convenient, handheld, patient-friendly auto-injector device with a monthly or even less frequent single-injection administration.” Viking Therapeutics (VKTX+0.41%): This summer, Viking Therapeutics said it was advancing its experimental weight-loss drug, VK2735, to a late-stage clinical trial. An earlier, smaller trial found that VK2735 helped users achieve an average weight loss of 14% from baseline numbers, plus 13% compared with a placebo after 13 weeks of treatment. Zealand Pharma: The Denmark-based drugmaker said that only about a third of patients who took up to 4.8-milligram doses of its drug petrelintide during an early-stage clinical trial experienced nausea — one of the most common side effects of popular GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. Zealand is pitching petrelinde as an alternative for patients who can’t tolerate GLP-1 treatments, which can include common side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Zealand previously reported in June that patients taking a high dose of petrelintide over 16 weeks lost, on average, 8.6% of their weight. Pharma companies are also developing weight-loss pills that could potentially open the market for patients who are resistant to needles and are likely to be easier to manufacture helping meet growing demand and avoid shortages. Novo Nordisk: Novo Nordisk said in September that patients who took a once-daily 50mg dose of its experimental pill amycretin lost an average of 10.4% of their weight in just three months. Trial participants who took two pills lost even more weight, 13.1% at three months. For comparison, a large clinical trial of Wegovy found that it helped users lose about 15% of their body weight over 68 weeks. It’s important to note that larger phase 2, 3, and 4 trials involving thousands more participants could return different results. Eli Lilly: Eli Lilly is also developing a weight-loss pill — orforglipron. The drug is currently in a phase 3 trial — its results will be published this year. Earlier trials found that it helped users lose an average of nearly 15% of weight after 36 weeks. Pfizer (PFE+1.27%): Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told analysts last fall that the company still expects its leading weight loss drug candidate, danuglipron, to be the second incretin weight-loss pill to enter the market. Pfizer announced in July it was advancing the development of danuglipron, a pill that mimics the gut hormone GLP-1. In December, the pharma giant said that a twice-daily version of the pill helped patients, in an early-stage trial, lose an average of 8% to 13% of their weight. However, the company decided not to advance this formulation to a late-stage trial due to a high rate of side effects. Viking Therapeutics: In November, Viking Therapeutics reported that in a small phase 1 clinical study, patients who took a daily 100mg dose of Viking’s weight-loss pill lost an average of up to 6.8% of their body weight over 28 days when adjusted for those taking a placebo. This result outperformed Novo Nordisk’s amycretin. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Companies are more transparent in announcing their donations, signaling a shift in attitude towards Trump compared to his first inauguration and the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. The record-breaking fundraising underscores a broader trend of corporations hedging their bets in a polarized political landscape, with businesses seeking influence and access in the new administration.

The record-breaking fundraising underscores a broader trend of corporations hedging their bets in a polarized political landscape, with businesses seeking influence and access in the new administration. Corporate America has poured unprecedented sums into President Donald Trump's swearing-in ceremony and related events, signaling a dramatic shift in the business world's relationship with the polarizing political figure. According to the New York Times, Trump's inaugural committee has raised more than $170 million, shattering the previous record set during his first inauguration in 2017. This surge in donations reflects a calculated effort by major corporations to curry favor with a man known for his unpredictability and penchant for rewarding loyalty â or punishing perceived slights. Tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft, along with CEOs from Apple and OpenAI, are among the top contributors. Auto manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies and financial firms have also opened their checkbooks, with many publicly announcing their donations months before federal disclosure requirements kick in. This marks a stark contrast to Trump's first inauguration, when corporate America approached him with skepticism, and to the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection, when many companies distanced themselves from him. The record-breaking fundraising haul underscores a significant change in how corporate America views Trump. During his first campaign and presidency, many companies were hesitant to align themselves with a figure whose rhetoric and policies often sparked controversy. However, eight years later, businesses appear to have adapted to Trump's transactional style of governance. "The stigma of a Trump donation, which was out there to some degree eight years ago, is no longer there," said Brian Ballard, a longtime Trump fundraiser who has helped raise money for the Presidential Inaugural Committee. "Who knows what's going to happen two months from now? But for today, up and down, corporate America is solidly pro-Trump." This shift is evident in the size and transparency of the donations. Microsoft, for example, contributed $1 million â doubling its donations for Trump's 2017 and former President Joe Biden's 2021 inaugurations. Google, which gave $285,000 to both Trump's first inauguration and Biden's, more than tripled its contribution to $1 million this time. Big names, big checks The list of donors reads like a who's who of corporate America. Tech giants Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft each contributed at least $1 million, as did the CEOs of Apple and OpenAI. Auto manufacturers Toyota, Ford and General Motors also donated $1 million a piece, alongside pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, telehealth company Hims & Hers, and tax service Intuit. Robinhood, the stock trading app, contributed $2 million. (Related: A strategic investment: Meta donates $1M to Trump inauguration fund.) In a sign of how eager these companies are to publicize their support, spokespeople for many firms quickly confirmed their donations to Politico. Chevron and Bank of America also acknowledged contributions but declined to specify amounts. "Everyone's trying to kiss the ring and curry favor with the new administration," said a healthcare lobbyist granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. "We're hopeful this new administration will be friendlier than the previous one." The surge in donations reflects a broader trend of corporations hedging their bets in an increasingly polarized political landscape. Trump's second inauguration comes amid ongoing legal battles, including felony convictions and promises to pardon participants in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Yet, these controversies have done little to deter corporate America from seeking influence with the incoming administration. The record-breaking fundraising for Trump's second inauguration highlights the evolving relationship between corporate America and the president. Once viewed with skepticism, Trump is now seen as a figure whose favor is worth courting, even at a high price. For businesses, the donations represent a calculated investment in access and influence, as well as an acknowledgment of Trump's enduring impact on American politics.

Title: Origin Materials, Inc. (ORGN) Stock: The Under-the-Radar Stock Poised for Massive Upside in 2025

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Under-the-Radar Stocks with Massive Upside for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Origin Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORGN) stands against other under-the-radar stocks. Investing in under-the-radar stocks can be a savvy move for those looking to diversify their portfolios and potentially reap significant rewards. These lesser-known companies often fly under the radar of mainstream investors, which can result in undervalued stock prices. Under-the-radar stocks can be found in various sectors, from emerging technologies to niche industries, and are often characterized by their small market capitalization, limited analyst coverage, and low trading volumes. According to Business Insider, several lesser-known hedge funds have outperformed the market, Glen Kacher’s Light Street and David Rogers’ Castle Hook, for instance, returned 60% last year, outpacing many of their more prominent peers. Jason Mudrick’s firm also had a strong year, with returns of over 31%. Meanwhile, the largest hedge funds in the world, such as Citadel, D.E. Shaw, and Millennium, had good years, although most failed to match the S&P 500’s 23% gain. The impressive returns achieved by lesser-known hedge funds can be attributed to their bold investment strategies, which included a focus on under-the-radar stocks. By investing in these hidden gems, these funds were able to capitalize on undervalued opportunities and reap significant rewards. As a result, these under-the-radar stocks proved to be a key factor in the funds’ success.

In an interview with Bloomberg on January 18, David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, shared his outlook for US equities, forecasting an 11% upside for the S&P 500 index, based on the expectation that earnings per share will grow around 11% in calendar 2025 and 7% in calendar 2026. Kostin emphasized that equity investors are already looking ahead, with the fourth-quarter earnings season about to kick off, Kostin noted that earnings growth for the quarter is expected to be around 8%, but the strong dollar may lead to fewer positive surprises than in previous years. Kostin highlighted that the US stock market is trading at a high multiple, around 22-23 times forward earnings, which is historically high. As a result, earnings will be the primary driver of the market, rather than multiple expansion. He expects the S&P 500 index to rise to around 6,500, driven by earnings growth. Kostin also cautioned that a higher bond yield environment is a concern, as it has been a headwind for equities in the past. However, Kostin expects that inflation will come down slowly, and bond yields will fall to around 4.25% over the rest of the year. Kostin suggested that portfolio managers should focus on owning US companies with domestically driven revenues, rather than those with high export exposure. This is because companies with high domestic sales are less likely to be affected by retaliatory tariffs. Kostin also mentioned that the Magnificent Seven companies have significant sales outside the US, and may face potential risks due to their high export exposure. Kostin acknowledged that the Magnificent Seven companies have had fantastic stock performances in 2023 and 2024. However, he expects their premium earnings growth to narrow substantially in 2025 and 2026, leading to a narrowing excess return. As a result, Kostin favors mid-cap stocks, which trade at lower multiples and have similar growth rates to large-cap stocks. He believes that mid-cap US equities, with a market capitalization of between $5 billion to $20 billion, offer a better risk-reward profile. Lesser-known, under-the-radar companies are often overlooked by mainstream investors, but present a unique potential for growth, particularly in sectors poised for innovation and transformation.

To compile our list of the 10 under-the-radar stocks with massive upside for 2025, we sifted through internet rankings to find 30 under-the-radar stocks. From that list, we narrowed our choices to the 10 stocks that analysts see the most upside to. The list is sorted in ascending order of analysts’ average upside potential, as of January 17. We also included their stock price as of January 17 and their hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database of 900 elite hedge funds as of Q3 of 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Upside Potential: 38.89% Stock Price as of January 18: $1.08 Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 10 Origin Materials, Inc.

Title: Netflix earnings preview: Sports to boost Q4 results as analysts debate future price hikes

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Netflix (NFLX) is set to report its fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday after market close. Analysts expect the streamer to deliver strong results after it ended the year with two back-to-back NFL games, a successful "Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson" boxing match, and the return of "Squid Game." Netflix stock has stumbled since the start of the year after finishing 2024 at record highs. The stock pullback comes as macroeconomic uncertainties have weighed broadly on megacap Big Tech. Here's what Wall Street expects for the fourth quarter, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Revenue: $10.11 billion (Netflix's guidance: $10.13 billion) versus $8.83 billion in Q4 2023 Earnings per share: $4.18 (Netflix's guidance: $4.23) versus $2.11 in Q4 2023 Net subscriber additions: 9.18 million versus 13.12 million in Q4 2023 "There are very high expectations going into this quarter," Geetha Ranganathan, senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief program. "But it's really the perfect setup for Netflix." Ranganathan called out the company's solid content slate, describing it as "one of their strongest quarters ever," as live sports programming dominated the platform. Notably, the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson match attracted over 108 million global viewers, becoming the most-streamed sporting event of all time. For context, the 2024 Super Bowl, which was the most-watched American TV broadcast ever, pulled in 124 million US viewers. Similarly, the NFL games averaged around 30 million viewers. According to Netflix, it was its most-watched Christmas Day game ever in the US. "It's going to be really interesting to see how [sports] shapes the future of Netflix," Ranganathan said, adding the recent debut of WWE Raw will drive further growth and retention. "This is really the big shift we're going to see this quarter," she said. "That's going to drive subscriber momentum for Netflix in a big way. We're expecting well over 10 million subscriber additions." This will be the last earnings report in Netflix's history revealing net subscriber figures. The company announced last spring it would stop reporting the metric at the start of this year. Investors have recognized the company's efforts over the past year, which, in addition to a strong content slate, have included more advertising successes. According to its latest update, Netflix's ad tier, now two years old, has reached 70 million global monthly active users. The stock has surged about 80% year over year. It hit several all-time highs in 2024, as many analysts call Netflix the winner of the hard-fought streaming wars. Still, the company revealed in its latest biannual viewership report that year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat — a potential headwind when it comes to its ability to raise prices and boost growth. Netflix last raised the price of its Standard plan in January 2022, upping the monthly cost to $15.49 from $13.99. It also raised the price of its Premium tier by $2 to $19.99 a month at the same time; the company again raised the cost of that plan last October to $22.99. The company has yet to raise the price of its ad-supported offering, which remains one of the cheapest ad plans among all of the major streaming players at $6.99 a month. "We've been expecting a price increase in the US market for quite a while now," Ranganathan said. "They're definitely long overdue." The company recently phased out its lowest-priced ad-free streaming plan, making the $15.49 Standard plan its cheapest offering for an ad-free experience. Valuation has also been a concern, with analysts expecting a downward revision to the company's 2025 revenue outlook, due, in part, to the strengthening dollar. Currently, Netflix anticipates revenue growth between 11% and 13%, a slowdown from last year's 15% growth rate. "I think they'll temper those revenue growth projections," Ranganathan predicted. "But I think the way that they offset that is with a big price increase, which could happen anytime this year." Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Mega-Cap Stocks That Could Continue Surging Post 52-Week Highs. In this article, we are going to take a look at where JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stands against the other mega-cap stocks. The US stock markets have gone up leading up to the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration. All the major indices are set to continue their optimism from last week, when the Dow, the S&P, and the Nasdaq all reported gains of over 3.7%. Even though the S&P had hardly moved from its early November levels when the election happened, many mega-cap stocks continue to register 52-week highs. We looked at some of these stocks and why they are expected to continue surging up with the earnings season already underway. To come up with our list of 10 mega-cap stocks that could continue surging post 52-week highs, we only considered stocks that have recently hit their 52-week highs and have a market cap of at least $150 billion. A group of business people discussing plans around a boardroom table adorned with a financial services company logo. JPMorgan Chase and Co. is a global financial services provider. It operates in asset & wealth management, consumer and community banking, and commercial & investment banking segments. The bank has shown a strong upward trend in the previous year with a gain of 55%. The reason for this optimism is the company’s recently announced Q4 performance. It exceeded the expected revenue for Q4 by $1.21 billion. Additionally, GAAP EPS was also higher ($4.81) than expected ($4.10). The Fixed-Income, Currency, and Commodities (FICC) trading Outperformed this quarter, clocking in at $5.01 billion, surpassing the expected $4.37 billion mark. The bank’s book value per share was up 11% while tangible book value per share was up 13% y/y. The net interest income of the bank was down 3% as compared to the previous year, but it still managed to exceed estimates. The strong performance of the company as well as continuous gain in the stock’s price for the whole year continues to deliver strong results for investors. Overall JPM ranks 1st on our list of the mega-cap stocks that could continue surging post 52-week highs. While we acknowledge the potential of JPM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as JPM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Can The Washington Post save itself?

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Staffers plead with Jeff Bezos amidst a talent exodus The Washington Post is one of the most storied organizations in American journalism. But it is in crisis, losing reporting talent, suffering a loss of readers and facing a staff rebellion against publisher Will Lewis. The Post has been swamped by "one debacle after another," since Lewis took charge of the newspaper a year ago, said NPR. The decision by the owner (and billionaire Amazon founder) Jeff Bezos to cancel the Post's traditional presidential endorsement in an apparent effort to placate newly-inaugurated President Donald Trump was a huge blow, causing "hundreds of thousands of subscribers" to cancel their subscriptions. Layoffs have led to fewer journalists on the job, contributing to plummeting morale that led some of the survivors to flee for jobs elsewhere. A "clear vision" to put the Post back on track to journalistic and financial success remains "elusive," said NPR. More than 400 Post staffers last week sent a letter to Bezos asking him to "get personally involved to turn the paper back in the right direction," said Poynter. The staffers said in the letter they were "deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions" that caused readers to bolt. They asked for a face-to-face meeting with Bezos in the service of "restoring trust that has been lost." Bezos did not immediately reply. Escape your echo chamber.

From our morning news briefing to a weekly Good News Newsletter, get the best of The Week delivered directly to your inbox. Bezos has "plunged my beloved Washington Post into darkness," said Eleanor Clift at The Daily Beast. Post reporters have done a "first-rate job covering Trump," but Bezos' decision to pacify the incoming president (with the non-endorsement, as well Amazon's $40 million expense on a documentary about Melania Trump) has raised the specter their journalism could be "compromised by anything that could damage Bezos' financial interests." Bezos' decision to get on Trump's good side "has ramifications far beyond the Post newsroom." If the Post is to remain viable, it must "retain, not lose, its talent," Margaret Sullivan said at The Guardian. It's not "unreasonable to question" whether the Post can maintain its independence in the Trump era, and "Bezos may not care." But if he does care, he should "show up — soon" in the newsroom to talk to reporters, and recommit to the "importance of editorial freedom." He should also dump Lewis, who has overseen a rapid decline in the Post's standing. For the sake of both journalism and "democracy itself, I sure hope he finds a way to do it." On the eve of Trump's inauguration, the Post unveiled a new mission statement: "Riveting Storytelling for All of America." The slogan is intended as an "internal rallying point for employees," said The New York Times. And the paper's chief strategy officer has announced a goal of reaching 200 million paying users. That's an audacious target: The Post currently has fewer than 3 million digital subscribers.

Title: Content Americas 2025: The Confab’s No. 1 Question, a Movie Renaissance, What Buyers Want, Brazil and Deals to Date
URL: https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/content-americas-key-themes-and-major-takeaways-1236279425/
Time Published: 2025-01-20T16:44:22Z

By John Hopewell Chief International Correspondent MIAMI — The best thing about the Miami Hilton Downtown is its vistas from above Biscayne Bay and opposite the city’s iconic serried strip of high-rises. Delegates at Content Americas, which begins its third edition this Monday, will be hoping that the market will afford an equally panoramic view of the international TV business. That’s crucial. Few areas of the world became so dependent on global platform investment as Latin America during the pandemic. Bucking worldwide trends, series season orders actually soared in Spain over 2024, shooting up from 43 a year earlier to 75, according to Ampere Analysis. “Content Americas is the first TV event of the year and, therefore, an opportunity to test, by talking to folks, your incoming hypotheses about how market trends will play out,” says Gaumont USA’s Christian Gabela. Related Stories VIP+ Why Synthetic Data Will Transform AI Data Licensing Trump Names Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Jon Voight as 'Special Ambassadors' to 'Troubled' Hollywood: They'll Bring 'Lost Business' Back As of Sunday, participation sits at just short of 2,000 delegates and 175 exhibitors, edging up from compared to 2024. Popular on Variety That slight increase reflects the fact that, when it comes to Latin America, most all players have attended from last, with Content Americas serving as both a market and production meet, connecting major players from Latin America, the U.S. Hispanic and Spain. Some urgent, specific questions need answering. One case in point: After across-the-board top exec layoffs and departures, effective from December, how will Televisa-Univisión streaming service ViX handle acquisitions? The big question delegates hope Content Americas will address echoes across the world: After a severe corrective in 2023, will global TV streamers in any way be back in the saddle driving growth in Latin America? Don’t Expect Easy Answers Content Americas attendees shouldn’t expect easy answers. “Global streamers are still in different phases — some are consolidating, some are driving toward profitability, and some are business as usual. It’s hard to know what the next year will look like. This unpredictability represents a challenging time for producers,” says Erik Barmack at L.A.-based Wild Sheep Content. Sales cycles have slowed dramatically after the launch of original production across the region, from Netflix’s “Club of Crows” in 2015 to Paramount+ and HBO Max service bows in 2021. 2024: As Bad As It Gets? There is a dire need for visibility, however. Some stats set to be fired off at Content Americas will make for startling viewing. In 2022, major global streamers – Netflix, Amazon, Apple, WBD, Disney, Comcast and Paramount – made 69 season orders in Brazil. By 2024, that figure was down to 28. Mexico’s 49 commissions in 2022 plunged 27% to 36 in 2024. Given global streamers have been the fundamental industry driver of recent years – and lifeboat in 2020 – their corrective plays out over the whole industry. One-year results, however, can be hugely misleading. In some countries, such as Brazil with Globo, incumbents are still highly important. One bottom line is that buoyed by ad tiers, SVOD players will continue to grow their subscription bases in Latin America, Netflix from 51 million in 2024 to 69.5 million in 2029, Omdia predicts. Some established players, such as NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises, look bullish on production growth. Its chairman, Luis Fernández, will deliver one of the most awaited keynotes at this year’s Content Americas. “At a time when Telemundo is the most-watched network in prime time, we are super-charging our scripted content production under one strong brand: Telemundo Studios,” Fernández told Variety last April. A Stabler Market The bottom line, per industry consensus, however, is that far fewer originals will be produced in Latin America in the future compared to the explosion of orders in the recent past. Producers hope, at least, that the market will settle. “2024 was clearly a year where streamers’ budgets for “originals” became increasingly under pressure,” says Gabela. “Our hope is that there’s greater stability in that regard in 2025.” Ringing the Changes “Stabler” is another way of suggesting that, of course, money will be tight throughout the industry. So the story of 2025’s Content Americas may well be producers’ and distributors’ reactions to that. “Independents need to be creative now about financing plans that incorporate multiple territories, to be clever about understanding public funds and the general ecosystems in particular markets,” says Barmack. There are some more obvious ways forward that are already on the radar. “Last year, as streamers cut back on commissioning projects, co-production and windowing became the talk of the town. In 2025, I think we’ll see more of those conversations materialize into deals as the industry readjusts,” says Gabela. “Fewer originals means the need for more co-productions and invites us to be creative to find the financing,” agrees EO Media’s Eze Olzanski. Movies: A TV Industry Future At least in the English-speaking world, there’s a kind of rebound in films from A24, Blumhouse, and Neon with “Longlegs” and “Terrifier,” for example, auteur genre films with talent cast against type. “[Creative] talent can make the difference and become a part of the business equation, and the payoff can be really, really high,” says Fremantle’s Manuel Martí. Gaumont USA, with Pasajero, has produced Netflix’s “The Biggest Fan” with Kate del Castillo as it sets up remakes of its classic film catalog at platforms. The Mediapro Studio has scored one of its most significant hits in 2024 with “El 47,” the frontrunner at February’s Spanish Academy Goya Awards. “I think the sector’s going back in some ways to what it was before,” Olzanski tells Variety, noting that global streamer production is ever more ‘local for local,’ though local may be one territory and fewer projects will be for all Latin America or aim for global.” Selectivity Volume for volume’s sake is a waning philosophy: “Independents need to be pickier, frankly, about projects. Not all of this pullback is bad — it’s forcing higher standards that the industry could use,” Barmack observes. Olzanski agrees. “The industry is finding its new balance, understanding its current size, how much it can produce and sell, and working for that size. It’s a moment of honesty for the industry.” “Reducing the number of productions and releases, particularly releases, might seem a bad thing, but on the positive side, gives more visibility and value to launches,” he adds. What Will Buyers Be Buying? There was a time – broadly last decade – when experiments ran wild at pay-TV operators and an early Netflix. From the turn of this decade broadly, a pivot occurred: “Creators are working with known genres and frameworks and then trying to reinvent them,” Berlinale Series head Julia Fidel noted in 2022. Now, “series are genre layering, layering one genre on top of another,” said Fremantle’s Manuel Marti. One part political exposé, another part espionage thriller, “Yosi, The Regretful Spy,” whose Season 2 competes for a Rose d’Or Latino, is one case in point. Another contender, the Natalia Beristáin showrun “Midnight Family,” from Fremantle and Fabula, melds a reality-sourced medical thriller and family drama. Series, Martí points out, will remain plot-driven, “making you want to see the whole season,” and character-driven, “making you come again for the second season.” Character-driven drama is, moreover, on the rise. “I guess at the Emmys, both ‘Shogun’ and ‘The Bear’ were character-driven, which is what people especially crave,” Martí observes. More Buyer Interests Beyond that, “Regular, returnable and franchiseable content will be the most attractive,” says Ampere’s Fred Black. “Particularly crime dramas, which work globally and are produced internationally.” On distribution, apart from the more relevant new launches, buyers are moving ever more into non-exclusive deals, says Olzanski. On the local side, “we’ve gone back to a more normal thing with the usual slots for television: Action, natural disasters, a family, kids, co-viewing, and so on,” he adds. The production of fewer originals doesn’t mean that streamers will be acquiring more, he cautioned, “and that is part of finding the new balance.” Brazil “Thanks to the global presence of the streamers, Brazilian producers’ content has been watched outside the country, which was great for them, and now they want more. Being in such a huge market, having success abroad is a newly acquired desire, not necessarily a need,” says Martí. Also, he notes that global streamers look set to be obliged to invest a percentage of gross revenues in Brazilian content. Content Americas 2025 takes place, also, as “I’m Still Here” scored a best actress award for Fernanda Torres and “Senna,” praised for its production values, has played in Netflix’s global Top 10 non-English TV charts. It’s a special moment for the international industry to see Brazil as a key production center,” says Luis Toledo, the former highly active Spcine exec, who is launching Filomena Productions to connect Brazil, Latin America and the global South with established international markets. “This is exactly the reason for creating Filomena. To “prove” or guarantee to the more developed film markets that the global South can deliver the same quality but with lower prices and also new stories/narratives. The world can’t stand watching ‘Fast and Furious’ number 156 anymore.” Deals to Date *El Estudio, partnering with L.A.-based Happy Accidents, has acquired adaptation rights to ”Here Come the Habibs,” a fish-out-of-water Australian comedy about a Lebanese family. The adaptation will be set in Mexico City. *Pablo and Juan de Dios Larraín’s Fabula and BBC Studios-backed Spanish shingle Brutal Media are set to co-produce “Los crímenes del Glaciar,” a Patagonia-set triller adapting Cristian Perfumo’s novel.

Title: Netflix’s Expected Q4 Subscriber Bonanza Should Get Earnings Season Off To A Fast Start

By Dade Hayes Business Editor As is the case with most Netflix earnings reports, the question for the company on Tuesday isn’t whether the number of subscribers will rise – it’s about just how high the number can go. Most Wall Street analysts expect a marked surge in the fourth quarter, which ended Dec. 31, driven by the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight, two NFL games and series premieres like Squid Game‘s second season. The report by Netflix, coming on the first full day of President Donald Trump’s second term, will kick off a five-week period of fresh media and tech financial results. The numbers and executive comments, a burst after the annual holiday lull, will offer the first signals about the trajectory of 2025. Related Stories News Netflix, Max And Paramount+ Earn DuPont-Columbia Awards As Streaming Moves In On Traditional Broadcast News Turf Cancellations and Renewals 'Love Is Blind' Renewed For Two More Seasons At Netflix As It Celebrates Its Fifth Anniversary Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Fox Corp. are expected to weigh in on their failed joint streaming venture, Venu Sports, and Comcast will brief Wall Street on progress with NBCUniversal cable network spinoff it announced last November, and Paramount Global will offer updates on the company’s pending merger with Skydance Media. Big Tech leaders will also make their voices heard after flocking to Washington for Trump’s inauguration. Watch on Deadline Netflix is expected to add 8.2 million subscribers in the quarter, reaching 290.9 million, according to the consensus forecast by Wall Street analysts. Given the company’s momentum surging at the end of December, estimates are undergoing upward revision. A survey of 45 buy-side analysts conducted by Guggenheim Securities found that 70% of them are calling for at least 11.1 million net adds in the quarter, and 29% are now north of 13.1 million. This is the last quarter when the streaming leader plans to report subscriber numbers, shifting its emphasis to revenue and operating margin, along with audience metrics like engagement. Tim Nollen of Macquarie believes the timing of the subscriber disclosure end is not accidental. “It is possible subscription growth will slow from here as paid sharing enforcement has largely cycled through,” he wrote in a note to clients, “but a slowing rate of sub growth does not necessarily mean slower growth for the company overall.” Nollen sees the company adding more than 10 million subscribers in the quarter, with “a decent chance” the tally ends up even higher, one reason he upped his 12-month price target on Netflix shares to $965, from $795. Alicia Reese of Wedbush Securities sees the company’s 2-year-old advertising business becoming a primary driver of revenue by 2026. In a recent research note, she maintained her “outperform” rating on Netflix stock at a 12-month target of $950. “Netflix has established a virtually insurmountable lead in the streaming wars,” she wrote. “Netflix can retain its moat while competitors try to replicate its business model. … With global content creation, balancing costs, and increasing profitability, Netflix has reached the right formula.” Among the questions Netflix will like face during its self-mediated earnings call (in which its head of investor relations selects and groups analyst queries as opposed to an open conference-call format) concern price hikes, advertising growth and the strategy for live sports. The streaming giant announced just before Christmas that it acquired rights to multiple editions of the FIFA Women’s World Cup, adding to the multi-year NFL relationship launched in 2024. Sports-adjacent WWE Raw also began weekly live airings earlier this month under a multi-year rights deal, adding a potent draw to the ad tier, which is where Netflix is focusing its energy. Disney is executing a similar streaming strategy. With its portfolio finally profitable five years after the launch of flagship Disney+, the company is pushing more customers toward the cheaper, ad-supported option. It also mimicked Netflix’s effort to force anyone sharing passwords to pay for the privilege. Like its media peers, Disney faces a number of other challenges. The L.A. wildfires, which got the year off to a catastrophic start, especially for many entertainment industry workers, will factor into the company’s earnings report even though they broke out after the quarter’s end. In a recent note to clients reaffirming her “buy” rating on Disney but raising some concerns, BofA Securities analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote that it “does not appear the recent LA fires have had a material impact on Disneyland attendance.” Even so, she sees “potential risk” to forecasts for incremental costs due to the need for temporary employee housing and business disruption. The quarter ending 2024, which is officially the first quarter of Disney’s fiscal year, which began last fall, “will be the trough quarter of this fiscal year” for the company’s Experiences division, Ehrlich predicts. The impact of two recent hurricanes, along with cruise ship pre-opening costs, will weigh on results. And then there is Venu, which was scrapped before ever launching. Announced with fanfare in February 2024 by JV partners Disney, Fox and WBD, it was sued on antitrust grounds by pay-TV provider Fubo. As part of a settlement reached this month, Disney said it would acquire 70% of Fubo. All three partners are likely to be asked to quantify their investment in Venu. During the trial, it was revealed that the tab had exceeded $50 million as the streaming offering was designed and staffed by more than 100 employees. Shutdown costs are likely to add millions more at an inopportune time given the austerity drive and cutbacks rippling through the traditional media sector. With a mixed bag including better movie studio results but disappointing NBA ratings and expenses for things like password sharing and other streaming initiatives, Ehrlich sees “several moving parts” and “unknowns” in play for Disney. Big Tech executives at Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Meta Platforms, meanwhile, usually keep their strategic cards close to the vest as they report earnings. This time, they will be speaking to investors shortly after gathering together in Washington, D.C. In throwing their support behind President-elect Trump along with major tech figures like Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen, the companies are hoping to be rewarded for their loyalty. Trump’s first term was marked by combative and acrimonious relations with the companies, many of which ultimately banned him from their platforms. President Biden’s administration has seen a number of regulatory actions aiming to rein in the companies’ power. Despite a parting warning from Biden about the “oligarchs” attempting to influence American democracy, a shared priority has taken shape among tech companies and government officials: making money through innovation. That’s a political message Wall Street can always endorse. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Broadcom is a fabless semiconductor company that designs semiconductors for a range of different industries and applications, based in Palo Alto, California. The company plays an important role in providing semiconductors for AI, specifically, they provide hyperscale data centre companies custom silicon chips. Over time, as companies such as Meta, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft build out their AI offering, the critical semiconductor content will come from both custom silicon chips, designed by companies such as Broadcom, and merchant silicon chips, designed by Nvidia. Depending on the use case, or workload, the hyperscaler will use either a custom silicon semiconductor or a merchant silicon semiconductor. Therefore, over time we expect AI processes to be driven by both Nvidia designed chips and custom designed chips from Broadcom and its peers.

Title: Trump’s ‘Drill Baby Drill’ - Why SLB Could Lead Energy Sector In 2025

"Drill Baby Drill!" The signature energy battle cry of Donald Trump has returned to center stage as he returns to the White House. His vision for American energy dominance is taking shape with the nomination of Chris Wright, a vocal advocate for fossil fuels, as his choice for Energy Secretary. Wright, 60, made his position clear during his Senate confirmation hearing last week: "Previous administrations have viewed energy as a liability instead of the immense national asset that it is." His appointment signals a dramatic shift from current energy policies, with a laser focus on expanding domestic production across multiple sectors. The Liberty Energy CEO, who is expected to win Senate confirmation, brings a unique perspective to the role. "To compete globally, we must expand energy production, including commercial nuclear and liquefied natural gas, and cut the cost of energy for Americans," Wright declared during his hearing. His stance represents a stark contrast to the Biden administration's pause on LNG export approvals and restrictions on federal land drilling. The focus on expanded energy production extends beyond the Department of Energy. Interior Secretary nominee Doug Burgum reinforced this agenda during his confirmation hearing, pledging to vigorously pursue maximizing energy production from U.S. public lands and waters as a national security imperative. His comments signal a dramatic reversal from the Biden administration's efforts to limit oil and gas drilling through reduced federal lease auctions and offshore development restrictions aimed at addressing climate change. Wright's vision extends beyond traditional energy sources. As an MIT-trained engineer who studied fusion energy, he supports developing small nuclear power reactors and geothermal energy, while expressing skepticism about the sufficiency of solar and wind power. "The solution to climate change is to evolve our energy system," Wright told the Senate energy committee, adding, "Do I wish we could make faster progress, absolutely." This pragmatic approach to energy transition aligns with Trump's broader energy independence agenda. CLEVELAND, OH (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) For investors looking to capitalize on this shift in energy policy, SLB (formerly Schlumberger) presents a compelling opportunity. The company's strong market position was recently highlighted by a 6% surge in its stock price on Friday's trading following better-than-expected Q4 adjusted earnings, driven by robust demand for its drilling equipment and technology. The company's confidence in its future is demonstrated by its dividend increase and announcement of a $2.3 billion stock buyback program. As the largest service provider to the oil and gas industry, SLB's global presence across more than 100 countries positions it uniquely to benefit from expanded domestic energy production. The company's Q4 performance, particularly strong gains in its digital and integration business, showcases its technological leadership and operational efficiency. While the energy sector's cyclical nature presents inherent challenges, SLB's valuation suggest significant upside potential. Trading at less than 11 times earnings with a 3% dividend yield, the stock appears undervalued. SLB's aggressive share buyback program and strong financials, combined with its AI integration and low debt levels, position it well for 2025's expected energy expansion. The company's technological leadership and global scale make it an attractive vehicle for investors looking to capitalize on potential U.S. energy policy shifts. As America moves toward more aggressive domestic production, SLB's comprehensive capabilities position it to play a crucial role in this transformation.

As Games Workshop seeks next success. An unannounced Warhammer RPG was seemingly on the cards, however the project was cancelled towards the end of last year. A report by MP1st details posts by former employees of a developer known as Thought Pennies - a "role-playing game studio creating games focused on social storytelling" - who had an unannounced Warhammer game listed on their LinkedIn profiles. As with many other companies over the years, Thought Pennies has been affected by layoffs recently. Two months ago, Thought Pennies' CCO Daniel Erickson posted: "Over the last three years at Thought Pennies we built something amazing. We never missed a milestone, our feedback was great, our partnerships strong. We went from two people and a PowerPoint to a team of almost sixty heavily-vetted, incredibly independent, passionate professionals. Our publisher changed strategic direction, however, and our previous project is now without funding." This change meant Thought Pennies was required to "shrink the size of the studio". While Erickson did not specify what the developer was working on prior to his post, others who previously worked with the company listed an "unannounced Warhammer" project being made in Unreal Engine 5 on their own pages, with one stating a "fantasy live service RPG" had been cancelled. One post seen by MP1st described the game as a third person "Co-Op PvE Action RPG with a cast of unique heroes and playstyles", whcih would feature melee and ranged combat, as well as 'monstrous enemies set in a dark fantasy world'. Eurogamer has contacted Thought Pennies for further information on its recent projects, and the reported cancellation of a Warhammer RPG game. This week's report follows word earlier in the month that Games Workshop is looking to expand on the Warhammer series further, and is on the hunt for "the next one" following Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2's success last year. "We recognize that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games. Clearly we are looking for the next one. We remain cautious when forecasting royalty income," Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree said last week. In addition, in December, Games Workshop and Amazon Studios officially finalised their plans to bring Warhammer 40K to film and TV screens.

Title: Dave Vellante’s Breaking Analysis: The complete collection

Time Published: 2025-01-20T11:33:12Z

UPDATED 06:33 EST / JANUARY 20 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider.

Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem.

We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / JANUARY 20 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

Title: What Analysts Think of GE Vernova's Stock Ahead of Earnings
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/what-analysts-think-of-ge-vernova-stock-ahead-of-earnings-8775587
Time Published: 2025-01-20T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
GE Vernova (GEV) is set to report earnings before the market opens Wednesday as the energy company approaches one year since General Electric completed its split into three separate companies. Analysts covering the stock tracked by Visible Alpha are mostly bullish, with 10 rating the stock a "buy," and two giving it a "hold" rating. Their price targets range from $361 to $446, with the average at about $392 sitting below Friday's record level after a strong week for the stock. Shares of GE Vernova gained nearly 3% Friday to close at an all-time high of $401.41, and have nearly tripled in value since their April debut. The company is expected to report revenue of $10.73 billion for the final quarter of 2024, up from $10.04 billion in the same time last year, when it was still part of General Electric. Net income is expected to come in at $634.87 million, after two of the company's first three quarters as a standalone company have resulted in net losses. The company said in previous quarters that its wind segment, the lone unprofitable arm of GE Vernova's three divisions, should be "approaching profitability" by the end of the fiscal year. The company said the shift will take time as it moves away from higher-cost offshore wind projects. Analysts have upgraded GE Vernova or lifted their price targets several times since it became its own company, including Bank of America analysts earlier this week. They have cited the growing demand for energy, especially in renewable forms, to power projects like data centers and artificial intelligence products as a positive catalyst for GE Vernova's sales going forward. The other former GE divisions, GE Aerospace (GE) and GE HealthCare (GEHC), are set to report their fourth-quarter results on Jan. 23 and Feb. 13, respectively.

Title: Stock market today: Asian shares gain and bitcoin hits a record high ahead of U.S. inauguration

WSB Now BANGKOK — (AP) — Asian shares advanced early Monday and bitcoin surged to a record high ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. U.S. markets will be closed Monday for a holiday. The price of bitcoin surged as high as $109,134 early Monday, up from $99,563, according to CoinDesk. Cryptocurrencies have gained substantially since Trump was elected, as investors wagered on his favor for such assets. European benchmarks gained in early trading, with Britain's FTSE 100 edging 0.1% higher to 8,515.80, while the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.2% at 7,729.06. Germany's DAX was nearly unchanged at 20,902.00. The futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.1%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped 1.8% to 19,925.81 after China’s central bank kept its key lending rates unchanged. The Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1% higher to 3,244.38. A Hong Kong court extended a deadline for troubled property developer Country Garden to reach an agreement with its creditors until next month in the latest slow step toward recovery from a prolonged downturn in China's real estate sector. Sentiment also was helped by upbeat comments by U.S. and Chinese officials ahead of Trump's inauguration later Monday. Pledges by both sides to work to improve relations may have alleviated some concerns over trade tensions that have built up as businesses brace for a possible increase in tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index climbed 1.2% to 38,902.50. The dollar slipped against the Japanese yen, trading at 156.17 yen, down from 156.31 yen. Expectations are building that Japan's central bank might raise its key interest rate in a monetary policy meeting later this week. Higher rates tend to boost the value of the yen versus the dollar. The euro rose to $1.0309 from $1.0281. In South Korea, the Kospi slipped 0.1% to 2,520.05. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.5% to 8,347.40. Taiwan's Taiex picked up 0.5% and India's Sensex surged 0.7%. Bangkok's SET gained 0.1%. In other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil shed 19 cents to $77.20 per barrel and Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 23 cents to $80.56 per barrel. On Friday, the S&P 500 climbed 1% and the Dow rose 0.8%. The Nasdaq composite rallied 1.5%. SLB helped lead the market after the provider oilfield services delivered bigger profit and revenues for the end of 2024 than analysts expected. It jumped 6.1% after it also raised its dividend by 3.6% and said it’s returning $2.3 billion to its investors by buying back its own stock. All the Big Tech companies in what's come to be known as the " Magnificent Seven " rose: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. Because they're so massive in size, their movements carry more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes than other stocks. Such shares have been under pressure recently because of criticism their prices may have shot too high after leading the market for so many years. Such worries grew after Treasury yields jumped in the bond market. Higher yields hurt prices for all kinds of investments, particularly those seen as the most expensive. But stocks broadly got a lift this week from an encouraging report on U.S. inflation, which raised hopes that the Federal Reserve may deliver more cuts to interest rates this year. More such cuts, which began in September, would ease the brakes off the economy and boost prices for investments, though they can also give inflation more fuel. Wall Street has been lurching down and up in recent weeks as economic reports pushed traders to revamp their expectations about what the Fed will do with rates. Lower worries about inflation have sent Treasury yields down and stocks up, while worsening worries about inflation have triggered the opposite reaction. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Title: 7 Dividend Stocks That Just Started Paying Shareholders
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/01/19/7-dividend-stocks-that-just-started-paying-shareholders/
Time Published: 2025-01-19T17:13:00Z
Full Content:
Finger pressing a car ignition button with the text 2025 start. Ready for the inaugurations? Yes, with a plural. We are talking seven brand-new dividend stock programs today. Dividend payers are our beat here at Contrarian Outlook. And we welcome newcomers because they can really kick off a phenomenon I refer to as the Dividend Magnet. Over long time frames—years—stock prices follow their payout higher. We like dividend growers because they are the surest, safest way to profits in the stock market. Buy a rising payout, sit back, and watch the stock price chase it. New dividend payers can be even better because they tend to grow their dividends quickly. New divvie payers know that they can make new payments comfortably and that they have plenty of dry powder for future increases. Wall Street is increasingly seeing the world the same way we do. A new dividend used to be treated like “the end of growth.” But more and more, investors realize exactly what a new dividend means, and they celebrate it. Just look at what happened to Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) after it announced in February 2024 it would start paying its shareholders: META Total Returns So, what fresh dividends should we have our eyes on? Let’s take a look at a handful of dividend initiations announced over the past six months, including a few distributions that will debut in January 2025. These dividends pay up to 8%+. Dividend Initiation Announcement: Nov. 6, 2024 First Dividend Payment: Dec. 19, 2024 Dividend Amount: $0.10 (Quarterly) Dividend Yield: 0.5% LandBridge (LB) is a land management company that owns surface acres in Texas and New Mexico, primarily in the Permian Basin. It generates revenues from surface use royalties, sales of resources such as brackish water and other surface composite materials, and oil and gas royalties. It went public in 2024 at $17 per share, and it has already more than quadrupled. It also announced its first dividend—a 10-cent-per-share quarterly distribution, first paid in December 2024. Dividend Initiation Announcement: July 31, 2024 First Dividend Payment: Dec. 20, 2024 Dividend Amount: $0.15 (Quarterly) Dividend Yield: 0.6% CGI Inc. (GIB) is an IT and business process services provider. CGI has spent decades on public markets, and while its shorter-term growth isn’t nearly as explosive as LandBridge’s, it has more than tripled the index over the past 20 years. CGI has long poured its cash back into the business and on the occasional repurchase. However, CGI announced in late July that it would be paying a dividend for the first time, which it did in December 2024—a 15-cent quarterly dole. Dividend Initiation Announcement: Aug. 14, 2024 First Dividend Payment: Sept. 16, 2024 Dividend Amount: $0.14 (Quarterly) Dividend Yield: 1.7% U.K.-based Marex Group (MRX) provides liquidity, market access, and infrastructure services to clients in financial, energy and commodities markets. These services include clearing, agency and execution, market making, hedging, and other investment solutions. It was founded roughly 20 years ago but only joined the public markets in April 2024. A private equity consortium still owns roughly two-thirds of the company, though it’s possible they will sell off some of that ownership stake over the next few years. Net interest income (NII) has gone from losses in 2019 through 2021 to $29 million in 2022 and nearly $122 million in 2023. Net income has gone up by nearly 300% in that time. Part of that has come from organic share gains in its core markets, but Marex isn’t shy about growing through acquisitions, including Middle Eastern brokerage firm Aarna Capital and Spanish biofuels company Dropet in 2024. So far, investors like what they’ve seen, driving shares 70% higher in less than a year. And virtually all of that has come following the announcement that Marex would start distributing cash to its shareholders. While many European companies pay semiannual dividends, Dropet’s August initiation announcement was for the start of a quarterly payout—a decent 14 cents quarterly that translates to 1.7%. If MRX follows through in the next few years, it could keep up a different European tradition: yielding far more than comparable American companies. Dividend Initiation Announcement: Nov. 12, 2024 First Dividend Payment: Dec. 16, 2024 Dividend Amount: $0.04 (Quarterly) Dividend Yield: 2.4% Alight (ALIT) provides a variety of cloud-based benefits and business solutions. The benefits side includes administration, healthcare navigation, financial wellbeing, payroll and more, and it does much of this through the online benefits portal Alight Worklife. Meanwhile, the professional segment offers cloud advisory, deployment, and optimization services. Alight is a relatively new publicly traded stock that hit the New York Stock Exchange in 2021 via a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). But it hasn’t enjoyed quite the same return as the previous stocks, losing a quarter of its value over the past few years. That’s largely because, while the top line has grown steadily and consistently for years even predating its SPAC listing, Alight hasn’t put up a GAAP profit since 2019, and 2023’s $345 million loss was worse than its prior three years combined. It was a bit of a surprise, then, when ALIT announced in November 2024 that it would start paying a 4-cent quarterly dividend. I say “a bit” because, though it has posted numerous years’ worth of GAAP losses, Alight is profitable on an adjusted basis, and it generates strong cash flows. Also encouraging is that recurring revenues account for roughly 90% of sales, and Alight spends its cash prudently, halving its debt in just five years. Dividend Initiation Announcement: Dec. 11, 2024 First Dividend Payment: Jan. 21, 2025 Dividend Amount: $0.19 (Quarterly) Dividend Yield: 2.4% Match Group (MTCH) is easily the best-known name on this list, albeit through its brands, which include Hinge, Match, Meetic, OkCupid, Pairs, Plenty Of Fish and, of course, Tinder—the most downloaded dating app and the highest grossing lifestyle app overall worldwide. Across its various properties, MTCH claims 15.2 million paying customers covering 40 languages. I don’t know that I’ve seen a bigger, ahem, mismatch than MTCH’s stock performance and its operational performance: MTCH Total Returns That’s not to say Match Group doesn’t have some problems on its hands. Revenue growth has slowed, in large part thanks to a two-year pullback in Tinder revenues. The company’s recent outlook for Tinder disappointed. But MTCH is seeing success with Hinge, as well as growth in Asia thanks to Pair and Azar. For now, Match Group is hoping to appease shareholders by throwing wads of cash at them. The company expects to return virtually all of its free cash flow to shareholders over the next few years, via both a $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization and a new quarterly dividend of 19 cents per share. Dividend Initiation Announcement: Dec. 16, 2024 First Dividend Payment: Feb. 14, 2024 Dividend Amount: $0.12 (Quarterly) Dividend Yield: 2.5% OneSpan (OSPN) is another new dividend payer from the technology sector, this one a cybersecurity company whose core focus rests on identification. Specifically, it offers products such as a cloud-based multifactor authentication solution (including biometrics, push notification, and visual cryptograms); a platform that allows banks and financial institutions to provide identity verification services; a mobile transaction protection development kit; and more. OneSpan is an extraordinarily fickle stock, peaking and burning out several times across more than two decades of trade. Naturally, then, one has to look at its current run—80% gains in a year—with a grain of salt. But perhaps that’s what OneSpan’s new dividend is meant to get under control. In mid-December, OneSpan announced it would start paying a 12-cent quarterly dividend as of Feb. 14, 2025. At today’s prices, that comes out to a 2.5% yield, which is pretty decent for a first-time tech payout. More importantly, the company’s language indicates that it’s keenly aware of the need to provide shareholder returns, saying they’ll consider a “range of options with additional capital allocation,” including share repurchases, special dividends and increases to the quarterly dividend, among others. Dividend Initiation Announcement: Oct. 1, 2024 First Dividend Payment: Jan. 31, 2025 Dividend Amount: $0.50 (Quarterly) Dividend Yield: 8.5% South Bow (SOBO) is typical of a new dividend payer in that it’s a spinoff. Specifically, this liquid pipelines business was spun off of Canadian energy infrastructure firm TC Energy (TRP). South Bow, whose name reflects its origins near Canada’s South Bow River, boasts more than 3,000 miles of oil and liquids pipeline infrastructure (most notably the Keystone Pipeline System) connecting Alberta crude oil supplies to U.S. refining markets in Illinois, Oklahoma, Texas, and the U.S. Gulf Coast. The company also owns storage terminals in the U.S. and Canada. Energy infrastructure stocks tend to be generous dividend payers, and South Bow is no exception. SOBO came out swinging at the bell—in the same release announcing its launch as an independent company, it also said it expected to declare its first dividend a month later (which it did). The company’s 50-cent quarterly dividend comes out to a yield north of 8%. For obvious reasons, there’s little price history here to study. But as is typical of an MLP, a high amount of its profits are contracted—in South Bow’s case, roughly 88% of comparable EBITDA, at an average remaining contract term of 8.3 years. In other words: Management doesn’t appear to be overreaching with its strong opening distribution. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images The monthly S&P 500 and NASDAQ composite cycles bottomed last week. There may be a minor pullback next month, but the overall uptrend is intact. Netflix is likely to be a leader in this rally. The stock has been strongest in the month of January. From January 21st through February 15th, price has risen over 85% of the time over the last 22 years. Daily, the stock is oversold. Weekly, we can see that relative strength has been rising since the spring of 2022. The monthly cycle has led price higher, and there is no cycle high until May. The stock is likely to rally over $900 in the next month and to new highs by April. 1-Netflix Daily This stock is very oversold and is due to rally. 2-Netflix Weekly Relative strength is expected to remain strong. 3-Netflix Monthly Cycle The NFLX monthly cycle points to higher prices. Fifth Third Bancorp also reports earnings this week and this report is also likely to be met with buying. Here is why. Daily, there are higher lows in momentum. The January through April time period has been bullish for these shares. In fact, from January 20 through February 16th, the stock has risen about 73% of the time. From the 21st through May 10th, the stock has risen 68% of the time. The third graph is that of the strong monthly price cycle. Thus, we see a combination of both the seasonal static cycle and the monthly dynamic cycle rising at the same time. FITB shares are likely to rally back to the prior $49 high. 1-First Third Bancorp Daily Momentum and relative strength point to better short-term performance. 2- First Third Bancorp Monthly Histogram Seasonality is at a low and strengthens into April. 3- First Third Bancorp Monthly Cycle The monthly price cycle heralds higher quotes.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. • Trump inauguration, Q4 earnings season will be in focus in the holiday-shortened week ahead. • With its transformative business model and clear growth trajectory, Netflix looks like a compelling buy for investors seeking quality growth. • Procter & Gamble faces operational challenges and tepid growth, making it less appealing in the current market environment. • Looking for more actionable trade ideas? Subscribe here for 50% off InvestingPro! U.S. stocks rallied on Friday ahead of the inauguration of Donald Trump, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 had their best week since the November election amid signs of easing inflation. For the week, the Dow and S&P 500 advanced 3.7% and 2.9%, respectively, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.5%. Source: Investing.com The week ahead is expected to be another eventful one as investors continue to gauge the outlook for the economy and interest rates. U.S. markets will be closed Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday. President-elect Trump’s inauguration also will be Monday, with the incoming president expected to issue a flurry of day one executive orders. Source: Investing.com Meanwhile, the fourth quarter earnings season shifts into high gear, with reports expected from several high-profile companies, including Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), American Express (NYSE:AXP), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL). Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will also be closely watched. Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe is just for the week ahead, Monday, January 20 - Friday, January 24. For investors looking to allocate capital this week, Netflix stands out as a strong growth opportunity. The streaming giant’s shift to advertising, live events, and monetization of popular content like ‘Squid Game’ are significant tailwinds that could propel the stock higher in the week ahead. The Los Gatos, California-based Internet television network is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter update after the U.S. market closes on Tuesday at 4:00PM ET. A call with co-CEO’s Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters is set for 5:00PM ET. Market participants expect a sizable swing in NFLX stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of nearly 9% in either direction. The stock rose 8.8% after the last earnings report came out in mid-October. Source: InvestingPro Profit estimates have been revised upward 27 times in the last 90 days, reflecting growing confidence among analysts. Only four downward revisions have been noted, underscoring Wall Street’s bullish sentiment toward the entertainment powerhouse. Netflix is seen earning $4.21 per share, representing a staggering 99% increase from the prior year. Meanwhile, revenue is forecast to increase 15% year-over-year to $10.1 billion. The company has shifted its focus from pure subscriber growth to prioritizing operating margins and revenue expansion. This pivot includes a robust advertising model, which is becoming a cornerstone of its growth strategy. On the content front, the blockbuster release of ‘Squid Game Season 2’ and other high-profile projects ensures a steady stream of engagement. Netflix is also venturing into live events, including NFL games and boxing matches, expanding its appeal to a broader audience. NFLX stock ended at $858.10 last Friday. At current levels, Netflix has a market cap of $366.8 billion. Shares are down 3.7% to start 2025 after scoring an annual gain of 83% last year. Source: Investing.com It is worth mentioning that Netflix has a great InvestingPro Financial Health Score of 3.1/5.0, reflecting its strong financials, robust growth prospects, and innovative strategies.

On the other hand, Procter & Gamble faces operational challenges and tepid growth, making it less attractive in the current market environment. The global consumer products company is scheduled to report its fiscal second quarter earnings report before the stock market opens on Wednesday at 6:55AM ET. The expected move in the options market is about 3.4% up or down. Shares fell 1.6% after the last earnings report came out in October. Underscoring several challenges facing Procter & Gamble, 18 out of the 19 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro cut their sales estimates ahead of the print, citing soft consumer demand and a challenging outlook. Source: InvestingPro P&G is seen earning $1.86 per share, increasing just 1.1% from EPS of $1.84 in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, revenue is forecast to inch up 2.2% year-over-year to $21.6 billion. These modest growth projections reflect increasing challenges for the company. The consumer goods giant recently faced operational disruptions, including a ransomware attack on one of its shipping vendors. The attack could weigh on distribution efficiency and hurt margins in the short term. Moreover, rising competition in key markets and inflationary pressures on raw materials are expected to limit profitability. As such, CEO Jon Moeller may strike a cautious tone and give soft guidance to reflect supply chain disruptions and weakening margins. PG stock closed last Friday’s session at $161.13, not far from its lowest level since April 2024. At its current valuation, the Cincinnati-based consumer goods company has a market cap of $379.5 billion. Shares are down 3.8% to start the new year. Source: Investing.com Although P&G remains a dominant player in the consumer goods sector with strong brands like Tide and Gillette, its growth is slowing, and the stock appears fully valued. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.7, the shares may not offer much upside at current levels.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Coverage of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, each year is something I view as a competitive sport. I actually start training for the intense week over the summer, as my few close friends know (and yes, they all make fun of me). The number of workouts every week in the lead-up rises incrementally so I can easily sprint up and down the two-mile promenade with a backpack to stuff in as many meetings as humanly possible (yes, I do this). My one cheat meal a week gets replaced by green drinks and extra doses of vitamins to ensure I don't get sick. I meditate twice a day and carefully pick out clothes I know will help me execute at the highest level. Look good, feel good, good things happen. To me, this one event is the closest I will get to being like Michael Jordan in the playoffs — and I am very lucky to be in attendance. And this year, the gathering of the elites flying in on private jets to wax poetic on the world's biggest problems will be extra nutty. Read more: Here are the biggest global risks for 2025 The conference unofficially kicks off on Trump's Inauguration Day. Some CEOs I know who normally would be at Davos all week are dropping in mid-week after working the inauguration party rounds. By Tuesday, the newly minted president may have uncorked a host of executive orders that could impact the businesses of the top CEOs on the ground. And, of course, impact the global markets. This is why this year's WEF will be more important than the norm for you, the average investor. The headlines will be coming in hot and heavy as CEOs look to challenge Trump or get on his good side. They will also look to talk up their businesses ahead of the start of earnings season, and with markets getting a little rockier of late. Here's what yours truly and our very own Jennifer Schonberger will be watching while bundled up in five layers all week. Be sure to bookmark the "streaming now" section on Yahoo Finance to catch all our market-moving interviews in real time. Or tune in where you normally catch us, whether that's on Samsung TV or our nifty app. Unlike our previous trips to Davos over the past decade, I will be taping several special episodes of the Opening Bid podcast on the ground. I could tell you who those guests will be, but where is the fun in that? Best to be surprised! Now, on to that guide... Big bank CEOs: The biggest names in banking, such as JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon, Citi (C) CEO Jane Fraser, and Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO Ted Pick will be in attendance. While this group will all get asked about Trump policies, it's going to be their outlook on interest rates that will be most key to market sentiment. Most have not spoken publicly since the Fed signaled a likely halt in rate cuts last month, and they will want to be heard ahead of the Fed's Jan. 28-29 policy meeting. The tariff CEOs: Retail will have a nice showing at Davos, with the CEOs of Polo Ralph Lauren (RL), Williams Sonoma (WSM), and Gap (GAP) (their CEO's first time at the event) making the rounds. These companies are right in the middle of the tariff debate. I'll be interested in how they are preparing for Trump tariffs from a supply chain perspective. I am also interested in how much they could raise prices post-tariffs — it could offer valuable insight into the 2025 inflation outlook and Fed policy. Read more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them? The race to catch Nvidia: It will be another year of artificial intelligence chatter throughout the halls of Davos. This time, I think the discussions will take two forms. First, unlike last year, where the AI discussions were mostly about potential, investors are going to want to see clear lines to revenue and profits. So I encourage AI CEOs to bring it. And two, we will probably hear more about how Big Tech players in Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are aiming to develop their own high-powered AI chips to catch Nvidia (NVDA), or at least make good enough chips to diversify. Leaders from OpenAI and Anthropic will also be in attendance, and their thoughts on chips could be key. I'll be watching Nvidia's stock price like a hawk this week, and you should be as well. Crypto delegation: The crypto industry has had a solid presence at Davos in the past five years. This year, the industry is expected to be out in force, headlined by an appearance from Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong. I'll be quite attuned to what the crypto crowd thinks about the latest volatility in bitcoin, MicroStrategy's (MSTR) bitcoin buying binge, what they are hearing from the pro-crypto Trump administration, and early assessments on Paul Atkins as the likely next SEC chairman. And of course, the new Trump coin that debuted to much fanfare (and market cap) on Friday. The token quickly rose to a market cap of $73 billion in about 48 hours, surpassing DOGE as the largest meme coin so far. The market cap of the crypto has since dropped to $12 billion from its launch, according to CoinMarketCap. Stocks: Stocks are beginning to look top-heavy (especially the Magnificent 7), as I have reported. I'm eager to hear from market pros such as JPMorgan's Mary Erdoes and economic experts like Nouriel Roubini on whether they are seeing red flags on the horizon. Any calls they make at this Davos may hold greater weight given more volatile market conditions and increased Trump policy uncertainty. The political wild cards: As of this writing, contacts have told me President-elect Donald Trump plans to send delegates to Davos. Who precisely gets the nod is the wild card. (I fancy it will be potential Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a Davos party scene regular for many years. Elon has long hated Davos, so hard to see him appearing). Trump himself is slated to give a speech remotely on Thursday, a source told Yahoo Finance. But who ultimately shows up from Trump's orbit — and what they say once touching down — could set the tone on US international relations right out of the gate. If a delegate arrives at Davos days after Trump takes actions that could weigh on the economic growth of foreign countries and then aims to explain the actions, best believe the inevitable headlines may not be so market-friendly. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

I actually start training for the intense week over the summer, as my few close friends know (and yes, they all make fun of me). The number of workouts every week in the lead-up rises incrementally so I can easily sprint up and down the two-mile promenade with a backpack to stuff in as many meetings as humanly possible (yes, I do this). My one cheat meal a week gets replaced by green drinks and extra doses of vitamins to ensure I don't get sick. I meditate twice a day and carefully pick out clothes I know will help me execute at the highest level. Look good, feel good, good things happen. To me, this one event is the closest I will get to being like Michael Jordan in the playoffs — and I am very lucky to be in attendance. And this year, the gathering of the elites flying in on private jets to wax poetic on the world's biggest problems will be extra nutty. Read more: Here are the biggest global risks for 2025 The conference unofficially kicks off on Trump's Inauguration Day. Some CEOs I know who normally would be at Davos all week are dropping in mid-week after working the inauguration party rounds. By Tuesday, the newly minted president may have uncorked a host of executive orders that could impact the businesses of the top CEOs on the ground. And, of course, impact the global markets. This is why this year's WEF will be more important than the norm for you, the average investor. The headlines will be coming in hot and heavy as CEOs look to challenge Trump or get on his good side. They will also look to talk up their businesses ahead of the start of earnings season, and with markets getting a little rockier of late. Here's what yours truly and our very own Jennifer Schonberger will be watching while bundled up in five layers all week. Be sure to bookmark the "streaming now" section on Yahoo Finance to catch all our market-moving interviews in real time. Or tune in where you normally catch us, whether that's on Samsung TV or our nifty app. Unlike our previous trips to Davos over the past decade, I will be taping several special episodes of the Opening Bid podcast on the ground. I could tell you who those guests will be, but where is the fun in that? Best to be surprised! Now, on to that guide... Big bank CEOs: The biggest names in banking, such as JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon, Citi (C) CEO Jane Fraser, and Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO Ted Pick will be in attendance. While this group will all get asked about Trump policies, it's going to be their outlook on interest rates that will be most key to market sentiment. Most have not spoken publicly since the Fed signaled a likely halt in rate cuts last month, and they will want to be heard ahead of the Fed's Jan. 28-29 policy meeting. The tariff CEOs: Retail will have a nice showing at Davos, with the CEOs of Polo Ralph Lauren (RL), Williams Sonoma (WSM), and Gap (GAP) (their CEO's first time at the event) making the rounds. These companies are right in the middle of the tariff debate. I'll be interested in how they are preparing for Trump tariffs from a supply chain perspective. I am also interested in how much they could raise prices post-tariffs — it could offer valuable insight into the 2025 inflation outlook and Fed policy. Read more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them? The race to catch Nvidia: It will be another year of artificial intelligence chatter throughout the halls of Davos. This time, I think the discussions will take two forms. First, unlike last year, where the AI discussions were mostly about potential, investors are going to want to see clear lines to revenue and profits. So I encourage AI CEOs to bring it. And two, we will probably hear more about how Big Tech players in Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are aiming to develop their own high-powered AI chips to catch Nvidia (NVDA), or at least make good enough chips to diversify. Leaders from OpenAI and Anthropic will also be in attendance, and their thoughts on chips could be key. I'll be watching Nvidia's stock price like a hawk this week, and you should be as well. Crypto delegation: The crypto industry has had a solid presence at Davos in the past five years. This year, the industry is expected to be out in force, headlined by an appearance from Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong. I'll be quite attuned to what the crypto crowd thinks about the latest volatility in bitcoin, MicroStrategy's (MSTR) bitcoin buying binge, what they are hearing from the pro-crypto Trump administration, and early assessments on Paul Atkins as the likely next SEC chairman. And of course, the new Trump coin that debuted to much fanfare (and market cap) on Friday. The token quickly rose to a market cap of $73 billion in about 48 hours, surpassing DOGE as the largest meme coin so far. The market cap of the crypto has since dropped to $12 billion from its launch, according to CoinMarketCap. Stocks: Stocks are beginning to look top-heavy (especially the Magnificent 7), as I have reported. I'm eager to hear from market pros such as JPMorgan's Mary Erdoes and economic experts like Nouriel Roubini on whether they are seeing red flags on the horizon. Any calls they make at this Davos may hold greater weight given more volatile market conditions and increased Trump policy uncertainty. The political wild cards: As of this writing, contacts have told me President-elect Donald Trump plans to send delegates to Davos. Who precisely gets the nod is the wild card. (I fancy it will be potential Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a Davos party scene regular for many years. Elon has long hated Davos, so hard to see him appearing). Trump himself is slated to give a speech remotely on Thursday, a source told Yahoo Finance. But who ultimately shows up from Trump's orbit — and what they say once touching down — could set the tone on US international relations right out of the gate. If a delegate arrives at Davos days after Trump takes actions that could weigh on the economic growth of foreign countries and then aims to explain the actions, best believe the inevitable headlines may not be so market-friendly. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Title: Stocks Await More Earnings After Strong Start And Better Inflation
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/01/19/stocks-await-more-earnings-after-strong-start-and-better-inflation/
Time Published: 2025-01-19T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
Last week, better bank earnings and friendly details within inflation data, sent stocks and bonds ... [+] higher. This week the focus will be on more fourth-quarter earnings and politics, with the Trump administration taking power and likely to begin making policy changes. Within the S&P 500, 20 companies reported earnings last week, dominated by large bank earnings. Seventy-nine percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the third-quarter earnings season picks up this week, with 40 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. S&P 500 Earnings Season Better bank earnings and friendly inflation readings sent bond yields lower and stocks higher. The S&P 500 rose 2.9% for the week, and the Magnificent 7 gained 2.0%. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA). Notably, bank stocks soared 8.2% on the back of better earnings. Market Performance While headline consumer inflation (CPI) rose to 2.9% year-over-year, there was better news beneath the surface. The rate of services inflation continued to decelerate. If this easing in services prices continues, combined with the likely deceleration in housing costs, the headline inflation rate should begin to moderate again. Headline & Services Inflation Until relief came last week, rising bond yields had begun to weigh on stock prices. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield had approached 4.8% on January 14 after being as low as 3.6% in mid-September 2024. Interestingly, the rise in yields has been primarily due to the increase in real (after-inflation expectations) yield rather than increasing inflation expectations. The better details within last week’s inflation reading sent the 10-year Treasury yield down to 4.6%. 10-Year Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Banks make up a sizable portion of this week's earnings reporters, but other companies reporting are 3M (MMM), Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). The financial sector contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to FactSet data, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 47.5% from 39.3%. Generally speaking, loan growth remained modest for the banks in the fourth quarter, but capital markets activity significantly boosted earnings. Bank Loans: Year-Over-Year Change The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by the powerful technology and communications services duo. Bringing up the rear is the energy sector, with a forecasted almost 30% decline in year-over-year earnings. 4Q 2024 Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are again the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7’s earnings are expected to grow by 21.7% year-over-year versus 9.7% for the rest of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 earnings aren’t scheduled to begin until the week of January 27. Magnificent 7: Fourth-Quarter Estimated Earnings Growth The significant decline in oil prices year-over-year should result in the expected earnings decline for the energy sector and weigh on materials. Energy Commodities Price Change The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter will likely depress international earnings growth at the margin. U.S. Dollar Strengthens Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.7% has slightly exceeded expectations, with the tailwind from an estimated 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. GDP & S&P 500 Sales Growth Sales growth is expected to be the most robust in the technology sector, with the energy sector predicted to show a decline in year-over-year revenue due to lower oil prices. 4Q 2024 Estimates Sales Growth By Sector Primarily due to the robust earnings growth for the banks, the blended earnings performance has outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +12.5% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary With few meaningful economic releases this week, markets are likely to be dominated by earnings and politics. President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday could unleash a wave of policy announcements, which could lead to some volatility in the impacted sectors. While the banks provided a solid start to the earnings season, this week’s reporters should give a glimpse into additional sectors and a strong dose of additional banks. Forward earnings guidance for 2025 will be watched closely as double-digit profit growth expectations are baked into consensus estimates.

Last week, better bank earnings and friendly details within inflation data, sent stocks and bonds ... [+] higher. This week the focus will be on more fourth-quarter earnings and politics, with the Trump administration taking power and likely to begin making policy changes. Within the S&P 500, 20 companies reported earnings last week, dominated by large bank earnings. Seventy-nine percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the third-quarter earnings season picks up this week, with 40 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. S&P 500 Earnings Season Better bank earnings and friendly inflation readings sent bond yields lower and stocks higher. The S&P 500 rose 2.9% for the week, and the Magnificent 7 gained 2.0%. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA). Notably, bank stocks soared 8.2% on the back of better earnings. Market Performance While headline consumer inflation (CPI) rose to 2.9% year-over-year, there was better news beneath the surface. The rate of services inflation continued to decelerate. If this easing in services prices continues, combined with the likely deceleration in housing costs, the headline inflation rate should begin to moderate again. Headline & Services Inflation Until relief came last week, rising bond yields had begun to weigh on stock prices. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield had approached 4.8% on January 14 after being as low as 3.6% in mid-September 2024. Interestingly, the rise in yields has been primarily due to the increase in real (after-inflation expectations) yield rather than increasing inflation expectations. The better details within last week’s inflation reading sent the 10-year Treasury yield down to 4.6%. 10-Year Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Banks make up a sizable portion of this week's earnings reporters, but other companies reporting are 3M (MMM), Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). The financial sector contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to FactSet data, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 47.5% from 39.3%. Generally speaking, loan growth remained modest for the banks in the fourth quarter, but capital markets activity significantly boosted earnings. Bank Loans: Year-Over-Year Change The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by the powerful technology and communications services duo. Bringing up the rear is the energy sector, with a forecasted almost 30% decline in year-over-year earnings. 4Q 2024 Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are again the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7’s earnings are expected to grow by 21.7% year-over-year versus 9.7% for the rest of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 earnings aren’t scheduled to begin until the week of January 27. Magnificent 7: Fourth-Quarter Estimated Earnings Growth The significant decline in oil prices year-over-year should result in the expected earnings decline for the energy sector and weigh on materials. Energy Commodities Price Change The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter will likely depress international earnings growth at the margin.

Title: Why Hundreds of Companies Will Buy Bitcoin in 2025

Time Published: 2025-01-19T11:00:00Z

EditorCrypto bitcoin, Bitcoin Magazine, Mark Mason Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan predicts a treasury revolution, forecasting hundreds of companies to buy Bitcoin as a reserve asset within 18 months, shaping a transformative ‘overlooked megatrend’. Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at Bitwise, has issued a bold prediction: hundreds of companies will buy Bitcoin as a treasury asset over the next 12 to 18 months. The shift, which Hougan describes as an “overlooked megatrend,” has the potential to significantly influence Bitcoin’s market trajectory. MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, has become synonymous with corporate Bitcoin adoption. Though ranked only 220th globally by market capitalization, the company’s influence on the Bitcoin market is disproportionate. In 2024 alone, MicroStrategy acquired 257,000 BTC—exceeding the total Bitcoin mined that year (218,829 BTC). The company’s ambitions show no signs of slowing. It recently announced plans to raise $42 billion for additional Bitcoin purchases, equivalent to 2.6 years’ worth of Bitcoin’s annual production at current rates. MicroStrategy’s actions are just the tip of the iceberg. According to Hougan, 70 publicly traded companies already hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. This list includes not only crypto-native firms like Coinbase and Marathon Digital but also mainstream giants like Tesla, Block, and Mercado Libre. Together, these firms—excluding MicroStrategy—own 141,302 BTC. Private companies are also significant players. SpaceX, Block.one, and others collectively hold at least 368,043 BTC, based on data from BitcoinTreasuries.com. Hougan highlights that MicroStrategy’s share of the corporate Bitcoin market is already less than 50% and is likely to decline further as adoption grows. What happens when larger companies, like Meta, which is currently considering a shareholder suggestion to add bitcoin to its balance sheet—20x the size of MicroStrategy start to emulate MicroStrategy’s strategy? Two major barriers have historically constrained corporate adoption of Bitcoin: reputational risk and unfavorable accounting rules. Both have shifted dramatically in recent months: Until recently, companies faced significant hurdles in adopting Bitcoin. CEOs and boards were concerned about shareholder lawsuits, regulatory scrutiny, and negative media coverage. However, as Bitcoin gains acceptance at institutional and governmental levels, these fears are dissipating. Post-election, Bitcoin has seen growing bipartisan support in Washington, making it increasingly “commonplace—and even popular—to own Bitcoin,” according to Hougan. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) introduced a new guideline, ASU 2023-08, that fundamentally changes how Bitcoin is accounted for. Previously, companies were required to mark Bitcoin as an intangible asset, forcing them to write down its value during price declines but preventing upward adjustments when prices rose. Under the new rule, Bitcoin can now be marked to market, allowing companies to recognize profits as its price appreciates. This change removes a significant disincentive and is expected to drive exponential growth in corporate Bitcoin holdings. Corporate motivations for holding Bitcoin mirror those of individual investors. Hougan outlines several reasons: Hougan asserts that the motivations behind corporate adoption matter less than the magnitude of demand. “You just need to look at the numbers,” he writes. “Where does all this demand look like it’s going? And what would that mean for the market?” Hougan’s memo paints a bullish picture of Bitcoin’s future. If hundreds of companies follow MicroStrategy’s lead, the cumulative demand could drive Bitcoin’s price significantly higher in the coming year. With 70 companies already on board under less favorable conditions, the stage is set for an explosion in adoption. This trend not only highlights Bitcoin’s evolving role as a treasury asset but also underscores its growing acceptance as a mainstream financial instrument. For mature investors, the implications are clear: the next 18 months could mark a pivotal period in Bitcoin’s journey from speculative asset to institutional cornerstone. With reputational risks fading, accounting rules evolving, and demand accelerating, Bitcoin’s integration into corporate treasuries appears inevitable. Hougan’s analysis invites investors to consider the broader implications: If corporations truly embrace Bitcoin at scale, what could that mean for the market’s future? For savvy investors, the answer might lie in acting sooner rather than later. Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

Title: The Slop Society

Time Published: 2025-01-19T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
In the last week we've seen the emergence of the true Meta — and the true Mark Zuckerberg — as the company ended its fact-checking program, claiming that (and I quote) "fact checkers have been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created" on both Instagram and Facebook, the latter of which was shown in a study from George Washington University to, by design, "afford antivaccine content producers several means to circumvent the intent of misinformation removal policies." Meta has also killed its diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Shortly after announcing the policies, Zuckerberg went on the Joe Rogan Experience and had a full-scale pissfit, claiming that corporations are "culturally neutered" and that companies should have both "more masculine energy" and "[have a culture] that celebrates the aggression a bit more," adding that said culture would "[have] its own merits that are really positive." Zuckerberg believes that modern corporate culture has somehow framed masculinity as bad, something he does not attempt to elaborate upon, frame with any kind of evidence (after all, it's Joe Rogan), or really connect to anything besides a sense of directionless grievance. This means that Meta has now "[gotten rid of] a number of restrictions on topics like immigration, gender identity and gender that are the subject of frequent political discourse and debate," which in practice means that Meta now allows you to say that being gay is a mental illness or describe immigrants as "filth." Casey Newton at Platformer — who I have been deeply critical of (and will be later in this piece!) — has done an excellent job reporting on exactly how horrifying these policies are, revealing how Meta's internal guidelines allow Facebook users to say that trans people are both mentally ill and don't exist (to be clear, if you feel this way, stop reading and take a quick trip to the garage with your car keys), and included one of the most wretched things I've ever read: that Alex Schultz, Meta's CMO, a gay man, "suggested in an internal post that people seeing their queer friends and family members abused on Facebook and Instagram could lead to increased support for LGBTQ rights." This is the kind of social network that Mark Zuckerberg wants — an unrestrained, unfiltered, unrepentantly toxic and noxiously heteronormative, one untethered by the frustrating norms of "making sure that a social network of billions of people doesn't actively encourage hate of multiple different marginalized groups." Finally, Mark Zuckerberg can do whatever he wants, as opposed to the past 20 years, where it's hard to argue that he's faced an unrelenting series of punishments. Zuckerberg's net worth recently hit $213 billion, he's running a company with a market capitalization of over $1.5 trillion that he can never be fired from, he owns a 1400-acre compound in Hawaii, and while dealing with all this abject suffering, he was forced to half-heartedly apologize during a senate hearing where he was tortured (translation: made to feel slightly uncomfortable) after only having six years to recover from the last time when nothing happened to him in a senate hearing. Sarcasm aside, few living people have had it easier than Mark Zuckerberg, a man who has been insulated from consequence, risk, and responsibility for nearly twenty years. The sudden (and warranted) hysteria around these monstrous changes has an air of surprise, framing Meta (and Zuckerberg's) moves as a "MAGA-tilt" to "please Donald Trump," which I believe is a comfortable way to frame a situation that is neither sudden nor surprising. Mere months ago, the media was fawning over Mark Zuckerberg's new look, desperate to hear about why he's wearing gold chains, declaring that he had "the swagger of a Roman emperor" and that he had (and I quote the Washington Post) transformed himself from "a dorky, democracy-destroying CEO into a dripped-out, jacked AI accelerationist in the eyes of potential Meta recruits." Zuckerberg was, until this last week, being celebrated for the very thing people are upset about right now — flimsy, self-conscious and performative macho bullshit that only signifies strength to weak men and those credulous enough to accept it, which in this case means "almost every major media outlet." The only thing he did differently this time was come out and say it. After all, there was no punishment or judgment for his last macho media cycle, and if anything he proved that many will accept whatever he says in whatever way he does it. Yet I want to be clear that what you're seeing with Meta — and by extension Zuckerberg — is not a "sudden" move, but the direct result of a man that has never, ever been held in check. It is a fantasy to describe — or even hint — that these changes are the beginning of some sort of unrestrained Meta, rather than part of the intentional destruction of the market leader in growth-at-all-costs Rot Economics. As I wrote in the middle of last year, Meta has spent years gradually making the experience of using its products worse in pursuit of perpetual growth. When I say "intentionally," I mean that product decisions — such as limiting the information in notifications as a means of making users and heavily promoting clickbait headlines as a means of keeping people on the site longer — have been made for years, at times in broad daylight, that have led to the deterioration of the core experiences of both Facebook and Instagram. Some are touting Zuckerberg's current move as some sort of master plan to appease Trump and conservatives, suggesting that this is a "MAGA-fication" of these platforms, where conservatives will somehow be given preferential treatment, such as, say, Facebook's recommendation engine promoting dramatically more conservative media than other sources. Which is something that already fucking happened! In 2020, journalist Kevin Roose created an automated Twitter account called "Facebook's Top 10," listing the top-performing (as in what posts were shared, viewed and commented on the most) link posts by U.S. Facebook pages on a daily basis, something he was able to do by connecting to Facebook's "CrowdTangle" data analytics tool, a product created for researchers and journalists to understand what was happening on the world's largest social network. Roose's reporting revealed that Meta's top-performing links regularly skewed toward right wing influencers like Dan Bongino, Ben Shapiro and Sean Hannity, outlets like Fox News, and the page of president-elect Donald Trump. Internally, Meta was freaking out, suggesting to Roose that "engagement" was a misleading measurement of what was popular on Facebook, suggesting the real litmus test being "reach," as in how many people saw it. Roose also reported that internal arguments at Meta led it to suggesting it’d make a Twitter account of its own that had a more "balanced" view based on internal data. Meta even suggested the obvious answer — sharing reach data — would vindicate its position, only for CrowdTangle's CEO to add that "false and misleading news stories also rose to the top of those lists." These stories danced around one important detail: that these stories were likely recommended by Facebook's algorithm, which has reliably and repeatedly skewed conservative for many years. A study in The Economist from September 2020 found that the most popular American media outlets on Facebook in a one month period were Breitbart and Fox News, and that both Facebook page engagements and website views heavily skewed conservative. While one could argue that this might be the will of the users, what a user sees on Facebook is almost entirely algorithmic, and thus it's reasonable to assume that said algorithm was deliberately pushing conservative content. At this time, Meta's Head of Public Policy was Joel Kaplan, a man whose previous work involved working as George W. Bush's Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, as well as handling public policy and affairs for Energy Future Holdings, which involved three private equity firms buying Texas power company TXU for $45 billion and immediately steering it into bankruptcy due to the $38.7 billion in debt Energy Future Holdings was forced to take on as a means of acquiring TXU. Jeff Horwitz reports in his book Broken Code that Kaplan personally intervened when Facebook's health team attempted to remove COVID conspiracy movie Plandemic from its recommendation engine, and Facebook only did so once Roose reported that it was the most-engaged link in a 24 hour period. Naturally, Meta's choice wasn't to "fix things" or "improve" or "take responsibility." By the end of 2021, Meta had disbanded the team that ran CrowdTangle, and in early 2022, the company had stopped registering new users. In early 2024 — months before the 2024 elections — CrowdTangle was officially shut down, though Facebook Top 10 had stopped working in the middle of 2023. Meta hasn't "made a right-wing turn." It’s been an active arm of the right wing media for nearly a decade, actively empowering noxious demagogues like Alex Jones, allowing him to evade bans and build massive private online groups on the platform to disseminate content. A report from November 2021 by Media Matters found that Facebook had tweaked its news algorithm in 2021, helping right-leaning news and politics pages to outperform other pages using "sensational and divisive content." Another Media Matters report from 2023 found that conservatives were continually earning more total interactions than left or non-aligned pages between January 1 2020 and December 31 2022, even as the company was actively deprioritizing political content. A 2024 report from non-profit GLAAD found that Meta had continually allowed widespread anti-trans hate content across Instagram, Facebook, and Threads, with the company either claiming that the content didn't violate its community standards or ignoring reports entirely. While we can — and should — actively decry Meta's disgusting new standards, it's ahistorical to pretend that this was a company that gave a shit about any of this stuff, or took it seriously, or sought to protect marginalized people. It's a testament to the weak and inconsistent approach that the media has taken to both Meta and Mark Zuckerberg that any of these changes are being framed as anything other than Meta formalizing the quiet reality of its platforms: that whatever gets engagement is justified, even if it's hateful, racist, violent, cruel, or bigoted. To quote Facebook's then-Vice President Andrew Bosworth in an internal email from 2017, "all the work that [Facebook] does in growth is justified," even if it's bullying, or a terrorist attack, and yes, that's exactly what he said. One might think that Bosworth would be fired for sending this email. He's now Meta's Chief Technology Officer. It's time to stop pretending that this company was ever something noble, or good, or well-meaning. Mark Zuckerberg is a repressed coward, as far from "manly" as one can get, because true masculinity is a sense of responsibility for both oneself and others, and finding strength in supporting and uplifting them with sincerity and honesty. Meta, as an institution, has been rotten for years, making trillions of dollars as it continually makes the service worse, all to force users to spend more time on the site, even if it's because Facebook and Instagram are now engineered to interrupt users' decisionmaking and autonomy with a constant slew of different forms of sponsored and algorithmicly-curated content. The quality of the experience — something the media has categorically failed in covering — has never been lower on either Facebook or Instagram. I am not sure how anyone writing about this company for the last few years has been able to do so with a straight face. The products suck, they're getting worse, and yet the company has never been more profitable. Facebook is crammed with fake accounts, AI-generated slop, and nonsense groups teeming with boomers posting that they "wish we'd return to a culture of respect" as they're recommended their third racist meme of the day. Instagram is a carousel of screen-filling sponsored and recommended content, and users are constantly battling with these products to actually see the things that they log on to see. I want to be explicit here: for years, using Facebook has been a nightmare for many, many years. And, to repeat myself, this has been the case for years. Meta has been gradually (yet aggressively) reducing the quality of the Facebook and Instagram experience with utter disregard for user safety, all while flagrantly ignoring its own supposed quality and safety standards. It's a comfortable lie to say that Meta has "suddenly" done something, because it gives the media (and society at large) air cover for ignoring a gaping wound in the internet. Two of the world's largest social networks are run — and have been run — with a blatant contempt for the user, misinforming and harming people at scale, making the things they want to see harder to find as they're swamped by an endless stream of sponsored and recommended content that either sells them something or gets them to engage further with the platform with little care whether the engagement is positive, fun or useful. Casey Newton of Platformer has done an admirable job covering Meta in the last two weeks, but it's important to note that he was cheerfully covering Zuckerberg's "expansive view of the future" as recently as September 25, 2024, happily publishing how "Zuckerberg was back on the offensive," somehow not seeing anything worrying about Zuckerberg's t-shirt referencing Julius Caesar, the historic dictator that perpetuated a genocide in the Gallic wars. Newton felt it unnecessary to mention the utterly atrocious quality of Facebook while quoting Zuck saying things like "in every generation of technology, there is a competition of ideas for what the future should look like." Yet the most loathsome thing Newton published was this: This is paper tiger analysis — stenography for the powerful, masked as deep thoughts. This specific paragraph is exactly where Newton could've said something about how worrying Zuckerberg modeling himself on a Roman emperor was. How this company was, despite oinking about how it’s building the future, letting its existing products deteriorate as it deliberately turned the screws to juice engagement. Casey Newton has regularly and reliably turned his back on the truth — that Meta's core products are really quite bad — in favor of pumping up various artificial intelligence products and vague promises about a future that just arrived and fucking sucks. The reason I am singling Newton out is that it is very, very important to hold the people that helped Zuckerberg succeed accountable, especially as they attempt to hint that they've always been an aggressive advocate for the truth. Newton is fully capable of real journalism — as proven by his recent coverage — but has chosen again and again to simply print whatever Mark Zuckerberg wants to say. I am also going hard in the paint against Newton because of something else he wrote at the end of last year — "The phony comforts of AI skepticism" — where Newton sloppily stapled together multiple different pieces of marketing collateral to argue that not only was AI the future, but those that critiqued it were doing so in a cynical, corrupt way, singling out independent critic Gary Marcus. I'm not going to go through it in detail — Edward Ongweso Jr. already did so — but I think there are far better comforts for Newton than his ambiguous yet chummy relationship with the powerful. I also did not like something Newton said at the end of a (paywalled) blog about what he learned from the reaction to his piece about AI skeptics. Newton said, and I quote, that he was "taking detailed notes on all bloggers writing ’financial analyses’ suggesting that OpenAI will go bankrupt soon because it's not profitable yet." I do not like bullies, and I do not like threats. Suggesting one is "taking detailed notes on bloggers" is an attempt to intimidate people that are seriously evaluating the fact that OpenAI burns $5 billion a year and has no path to profitability. I don't know if this is about me, nor do I particularly care. I have, however, been taking detailed notes on Casey Newton for quite some time. While Newton's metaverse interview from 2021 was deeply irresponsible in how much outright nonsense it printed, arguably his most disgraceful was his October 26 2021 piece called "The Facebook Papers' missing piece" — an interview with an anonymous "integrity worker" that attempted to undermine the Wall Street Journal's Facebook Files (that revealed in that "Facebook Inc. knows, in acute detail, that its platforms are riddled with flaws that cause harm, often in ways only the company fully understands"), in a seeming attempt to discredit (by proxy) the bravery of Frances Haugen, the whistleblower that provided the documents that led to this reporting. It's utterly repulsive corporate hand-washing, and it's important context for any criticism he has of Meta going forward, especially if he tries to suggest he's always held it to account. I think Newton seems a little more comfortable with the powerful's messaging than he should. He's argued that while AI companies have hit a scaling wall, it's actually okay, that NFTs went finally mainstream in 2022, that Clubhouse was the future, that live audio was Zuckerberg's "big bet on creators" in 2021 due to "the shift in power from institutions to individuals" (Facebook shut down its podcast service a year later), that — and I cannot see the full text here, because it's paywalled — "metaverse pessimists were missing something" because "Meta's grand vision [was] already well on its way" in November 2021, that Meta's leadership changed its mind about its name because "Facebook [was] not the future of the company," that Axie Infinity — a crypto/web3 Pokémon clone that has created its own form of indentured servitude in the global south backed by Andreessen Horowitz — was "turning gaming on its head" (the game sucks)...okay, I'll stop. Casey has also, at times, had dalliances with criticisms — sometimes even of Facebook! No, really! — but it's hard to take them seriously when he writes a piece for The Verge about how "Google plans to win its antitrust trial," printing the legal and marketing opinion of one of the largest companies in the world knowing full-well that the Department of Justice would not get such an opportunity. In emails revealed in the Department of Justice's antitrust trial against Google Search, Google specifically mentioned having briefed Newton with the intention of, and I quote, "look[ing] for ways to drive headlines on [Google's] own terms." In Newton's defense, this is standard PR language, but it is, within the context of what I'm writing, hard to ignore. The reason I am so fucking furious at Newton is he is part of the media machine that has helped repeatedly whitewash Mark Zuckerberg and his cronies, running glossy puff-pieces with scumbags like Nick Clegg, and saying things like "the transition away from Facebook’s old friends and family-dominated feeds to Meta’s algorithmic wonderland seems to be proceeding mostly without incident." That line, I add, was published in 2023, two years after the release of The Facebook Files, which revealed that the company knew its algorithmic timeline had a propensity to push users into increasingly-radical echo chambers. And one year after Amnesty International published a report accusing Facebook’s algorithms of “supercharging the spread of harmful anti-Rohingya content in Myanmar” amidst a genocide that saw an estimated million displaced and tens of thousands massacred. Newton has spent years using his vast platform to subtly defend companies actively making their products worse, occasionally proving he can be a real journalist (his work on the acquisition of Twitter was genuinely great), only to slip back into the comfortable pajamas of "Are We Being Too Mean To Meta?" The media — especially people like Newton — are extremely influential over public policy and the overall way that society views the tech industry. As an experienced, knowledgeable journalist, Newton has too regularly chosen to frame "fair and balanced" as "let's make sure the powerful get their say too." As I've said — and will continue to say — Casey Newton is fully capable of doing some of the literal best journalism in tech, such as his coverage of the horrible lives of Facebook moderators, yet has, up until alarmingly recently, chosen to do otherwise. The cost, by the way, is that the powerful have used Newton and others as mouthpieces to whitewash their contemptuous and half-baked product decisions. I don't know Newton's intentions, nor will I attempt to guess at them. What I will say is that as a result of Casey Newton's work, Mark Zuckerberg and his products have received continual promotion of their ideas and air cover for their failures, directly influencing public opinion in the process. Worse still, Newton has acted for years like nothing was wrong with the quality of platforms themselves. Had Newton written with clarity and purpose about the erosion of quality in Facebook and Instagram, Zuckerberg would have lost a valuable way to convince the 150,000+ people that read Platformer that things were fine, that the quality was fine, that Meta is an innovative company, and that there was no reason to dislike Mark Zuckerberg. There was, and there always will be. Putting aside the horrifying person he obviously is, Zuckerberg is a career liar and a charlatan, and has deliberately made the lives of billions of people worse as a means of increasing revenue growth. And I believe that he's about to inspire a new era of decay, where tech executives, unburdened by their already-flimsy approach to societal norms and customer loyalty, will begin degrading experiences at scale, taking as many liberties as possible. Meta has fired the starting gun of the Slop Society. In an interview with the Financial Times from December 2024, Meta's Vice President of Product for Generative AI (Connor Hayes) said that Meta "expect[s] AIs to actually, over time, exist on [Meta's] platforms, kind of in the same way that accounts do," each one having their own bios and profile pictures and the ability to "generate and share content powered by AI on the platform." This came hot off the heels of Zuckerberg saying in a quarterly earnings call that Meta would "...add a whole new category of content, which is AI generated or AI summarized content or kind of existing content pulled together by AI in some way," effectively promising to drop AI slop into feeds already filled full of recommended and sponsored content that gets in the way of you seeing real human beings. This led to a scandal where users discovered what they believed to be brand new AI profiles. Karen Attiah of the Washington Post wrote a long thread on Bluesky (and a piece in the post itself) about her experience talking to a bot she (fairly!) described as "digital blackface," with Meta receiving massive backlash for bots that would happily admit they were trained by a bunch of white people. It turns out these bots had been around for around a year in various forms but were so unpopular that nobody really noticed until the Financial Times story, leading to Meta deleting the bots, at least for now. I am 100% sure that these chatbots will return, because it's fairly obvious that Meta intends to fill your feeds with content either entirely generated or summarized by generative AI, be it with fake profiles or content itself. AI-generated slop already dominates the platform, and as discussed earlier, the quality of the platform has fallen into utter disrepair, mostly because Meta's only concern is keeping you on the platform to show you ads or content it’s been paid to show you, even if the reason you're seeing it is because you can't find the stuff you actually want to find. That's because all roads lead back to the Rot Economy — the growth-at-all-costs mindset that means that the only thing that matters is growth of revenue, which comes from showing as many ads to you as possible. It's almost ridiculous to call us "users" of Facebook at this point. We are the used, the punished, the terrorized, the tricked, the scammed, and the abused, constantly forced to navigate through layers of abstraction between the thing we are allegedly using and the features we'd like to use. It's farcical how little attention has been given to how bad tech products have gotten, and few have decayed as severely as Facebook thanks to its near-monopoly on social media. I, personally, would rather not use Instagram, but there are people I know that I only really speak to there, and I know many people who have the same experience. As Zuckerberg and his ilk are intimately aware, people really don't have anywhere else to go, which — along with a lack of regulation and a compliant media — has given them permission to adjust their services to increase advertising impressions, which in practice means giving you more reasons to stay on the platforms, which means "put more things in the way of what you want to see" rather than "create more compelling experiences for users." It's the same thing that happened with Google Search, where the revenue team pushed the search team to make search results worse as a means of increasing the amount of times people searched for things on Google — because a user that finds what they're looking for quickly spends less time on the site looking at ads. It's why the Apple App Store is so chaotically-organized and poorly-curated — Apple makes money on the advertising impressions it gets from you searching — and why so many products on the App Store have expensive and exploitative microtransactions, because Apple makes 30% off of all App Store revenue, even if the app sucks. And I believe that Zuckerberg loosening community standards and killing fact checking is just the beginning of tech's real era of decay. Trump, and by extension those associated with him, win in part by bulldozing norms and good taste. They do things that most of us agree are bad (such as being noxious and cruel, which I realize is a dilution) and would never do, moving the Overton window (the range of acceptable things in a society) further and further into Hell in the process. In this case, we've already seen tech's Overton window shift for years — a lack of media coverage of the actual decay of these products and a lack of accountability for tech executives (both in the media and regulation) has given companies the permission to quietly erode their services, and because everybody made things shittier over time, it became accepted practice to punish and trick customers with dark patterns (design choices to intentionally mislead people) to the point that the FTC found last year that the majority of subscription apps and websites use them. I believe, however, that Zuckerberg is attempting to move it further — to publicly say "we're going to fill your feeds with AI slop" and "we're firing 5% of our workers because they suck" and "we're going to have AI profiles instead of real people on the site you visit to see real people's stuff" and "we don't really give a shit about marginalized people" and "people are too mean to men" knowing, in his position as the CEO of one of the largest tech companies in the world, that people will follow. Tech has already taken liberties with the digital experience and I believe the Slop Era will be one where experiences will begin to subtly and overtly rot, with companies proudly boasting that they're making "adjustments to user engagement that will provide better business-forward outcomes," which will be code for "make them worse so that we make more money." I realize that there's an obvious thing I'm not saying: that the Trump administration isn't going to be any kind of regulatory force against big tech. Trump is perhaps the most transactional human being ever to grace the earth. Big tech, knowing this, has donated generously to the Trump inaugural fund. It’s why Trump has completely reversed his position on TikTok, having once wanted to ban the platform, now wants to give it a reprieve because he “won youth by 34 points” and “there are those that say that TikTok has something to do with that.” Tech knows that by kissing the ring, it can do whatever it wants. Not that previous governments have been effective at curbing the worst excesses of big tech. Outside of the last few years, and specifically the work done by the FCC under Lina Khan, antitrust against big tech has been incredibly weak, and no meaningful consumer protections exist to keep websites like Facebook or Google functional for consumers, or limit how exploitative they can be. The media has failed to hold them accountable at scale, which has in turn allowed the Overton window to shift on quality, and now that Trump — and the general MAGAfied mindset of "you can say or do whatever you want if you do so confidently or loudly enough" — has risen to power again, so too will an era of outright selfishness and cruelty within the products that consumers use every day, except this time I believe they finally have permission to enter their slop era. I also think that Trump gives them confidence that monopolies like Facebook, Instagram, Microsoft 365 (Microsoft's enterprise monopoly over business productivity software), Google Search, and Google Advertising (remedies will take some time, and the Trump administration will likely limit any punishment it inflicts) will remain unchallenged. What I'm describing is an era of industrial contempt for the consumer, a continuation of what I described in Never Forgive Them, where big tech decides that they will do whatever they want to customers within the boundaries of the law, but with little consideration of good taste, user happiness, or anything other than growth. How this manifests in Facebook and Instagram will be fairly obvious. I believe that the already-decrepit state of these platforms will accelerate. Meta will push as much AI slop as it wants, both created by its generative models and their users, and massively ramp up content that riles up users with little regard for the consequences. Instagram will become more exploitative and more volatile. Instagram ads have been steadily getting more problematic, and I think Meta will start taking ads from just about anyone. This will lead to an initial revenue bump, and then, I hypothesize, a steady bleed of users that will take a few quarters to truly emerge. Elsewhere, we're already seeing the first sign of abusive practices. Both Google and Microsoft are now forcing generative AI features onto customers, with Google grifting business users by increasing the cost of Google Workspace by $2-per-user-per-month along with AI features they don't want, and Microsoft raising the price of consumer Office subscriptions, justifying the move by adding Copilot AI features that, again, customers really don't want. The Information's Jon Victor and Aaron Holmes add that it's yet to be seen what Microsoft does with the corporate customers using Microsoft's 365 productivity suite — adding Copilot costs $30-per-user-per-month — but my hypothesis is it will do exactly the same thing that Google did to its business customers. I should also be clear that the reason they're doing this is that they're desperate. These companies must express growth every single quarterly earnings or see their stock prices crater, and big tech companies have oriented themselves around growth as a result — meaning that they're really not used to having to compete for customers or make products they like. For over a decade, tech has been rewarded for creating growth opportunities empowered by monopolistic practices, and I'd argue that the cultures that created the products that people remember actually liking are long-dead, their evangelists strangled by the soldiers of the Rot Economy. You are, more than likely, already seeing the signs that this is happening. The little features on the products you use that feel broken — like when you try and crop an image on iOS and it sometimes doesn't actually crop it, when the "copy link" button on Google Docs doesn't work, when a Google Search gives you a page of forum links that don't answer your question — and I expect things to get worse, possibly in new and incredibly frustrating ways. I deeply worry that we're going to enter the most irresponsible era of tech yet — not just in the harms that companies allow or perpetuate, but in the full rejection of their stewardship for the products themselves. Our digital lives are already chaotic and poisonous, different incentives warring for our attention, user interfaces corroded by those who believe everything is justified in pursuit of growth. I fear that the subtle little problems you see every day will both multiply and expand, and that the core services we use will break down, because I believe the most powerful in big tech never really gave a shit and no longer believe they have to pretend otherwise.

We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 15 Stocks & The California Wildfires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. In a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on the devastation ushered in by the California wildfire calamity, social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, and interest rates. Cramer started the show by talking about healthcare stocks and said "Healthcare really hasn't had much of a move so I think those stocks, honestly a safe haven with interest rates going higher." He added that the US government's export control rules to protect American national security interests were hitting markets hard. According to Cramer "I still expect 5% to hit on the ten-year [bond] but I've got to tell you the tone is hideous, I think the tone is being set by the Biden administration, doing a last minute 200-page ruling about who can get AI and who can't." He added "And then David, I've got to tell you, I think the Zuckerberg interview on Joe Rogan was seminal." The reason behind it was that Zuckerberg's thoughts about the firm behind the iPhone indicated "you're done, nothing since Steve Jobs, one one of the most offensive interviews I've heard in a very long time. Returning to the rate cuts, Cramer asserted again that the Fed had misjudged the economy by lower rates in December. According to him "The whole concept of the rate cuts, as opposed to one or two rate cuts, gotta be off the table because it looks like we've had some very serious misjudgment by the Fed." As for the fires, Cramer started by stating that there's "Not enough talk about the fires." The day this show was aired, he was covering the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Cramer outlined "I certainly wanna ask everyone at the healthcare conference, what can happen, in terms of public health, what can happen in terms of asthma." Along with healthcare problems arising from the disaster, he added "But more important as you know, Carl, the loss of life, the destruction, so immense, it's going to impact the economy. We don't even know yet, what could be the results." One industry that's been at the center of media coverage whether it's for disasters or healthcare is the insurance industry. Talking about insurance, Cramer revealed, "Well I have to tell you, the insurance regime out here in California is so strict that you have to wonder why bother to write anything. There's a loss-sharing agreement that's terrible, there is a sense to me that it's going to take longer to come back than people realize. David, the rebuild will be immense, it's obviously not done." He added "And I think that if we're going to talk about what the economy, what's going to happen, one-fifth of the country is California. Obviously, this is just the South end, could be contained to Los Angeles. But you know David this is one of those things we can't really factor in but we must factor in, in terms of trying to figure out what it's gonna mean for the whole US economy." The CNBC host also shared his thoughts on some of the reasons behind the wildfires. "Yeah look I think that we're gonna look at this, we're gonna say, there are reasons why this happened. Reservoirs not working. Some issues, whether the firefighters were ready." Linking the calamity with interest rates, he commented, "But you know Carl the most important this is at least, if we're going to talk about the economy, if we're going to talk about the rate cuts versus rate increases, it may be a reason that we have to put things on a pause. Maybe when the smoke clears. Proverbial smoke and literal. It may mean that things are going to be slower." Cramer then returned to Zuckerberg's podcast appearance. According to him "Zuckerberg. I mean I gotta hand it to him, I mean he basically made the Justice Department's case against" the iPhone designer. He added "It's almost as if he sat down with, with the outgoing administration, Jonathan Kanter, and said, look let me tell you what I think" the firm is doing. Cramer concluded "Because everything that he's complaining about, the Justice Department is complaining about. Carl, it was one of the most damming interviews. I couldn't tell whether Mark was having fun, or whether he was just basically saying Apple is the axis of evil and others that play along because they all are scared. . . And he's not scared. He's tough. Taekwondo. . .it's a libertarian love fest." As for whether Zuckerberg's remarks were made to buttress his relationship with the incoming Trump administration, Cramer commented "Well he's, let's call him savvy. He talked about libertarian, but there were these moments, you know he lives on a ranch, and he has to shoot pigs. Okay, so he's pro-gun." However, Cramer added, "At one point, . . .it did have a kind of element of extremism that I'm not used to anyone having." He also speculated whether Zuckerberg was aware of how he sounded during the interview. According to Cramer: "And I think that Joe Rogan is sophisticated enough to be able to put a line out for Mark to really go for it. I don't know whether Mark realizes exactly how damming it sounds, and I think that it's a little of a shame if only just because he made me feel like that he himself really despises a company that we all love. I wish that there'd been some push back." Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired recently For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). An aerial view of the energy producing facility, highlighting its potential of providing utilities to the public. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 89 GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) is an energy company that operates in the power generation and electrification industries. It is also among the handful of firms capable of manufacturing nuclear power reactors. The exposure has served GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) well since the stock is up by a whopping 205% over the past year. The strong share price performance is due to the AI data center industry's thirst for clean power generation which has grown the demand for nuclear power. Cramer, however, isn't a believer in the near-term potential of nuclear power; but, at the same time, he's a fan of GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV): "The company that would probably build them [small nuclear reactors] here is GE Vernova. They don't really have a game plan to do anything before twenty, uh, thirty two." Overall GEV ranks 5th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of GEV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GEV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 5 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other growth stocks. Kevin Mahn, President & CIO at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management, recently appeared on CNBC on January 6 to discuss the current market momentum and emphasize the need for investors to be selective in 2025 to find growth opportunities. He highlighted that while the MAG7 have led the market recently, their leadership may not continue. Mahn referenced historical data, noting that since 1950, there have been nine instances where the market rallied by 20% or more, with the market rising in eight of those cases. However, he pointed out that gains in the following year averaged only 3.6%, indicating a need for careful selection. He also acknowledged recent market trends, including a decline in the S&P 500's performance and a potential shift in investor sentiment following events like the Santa Claus Rally. He predicted a path of lower interest rates, expecting 50 basis points of cuts this year instead of the previously anticipated 100 basis points. Mahn suggested that this environment would create favorable conditions for stocks and bonds but urged investors to diversify beyond mega-cap tech stocks into sectors like biotech and aerospace. Earlier on January 3 as well, Mahn noted that after two consecutive years of gains, a third year of strong performance appears unlikely. He remarked that it seems the Grinch got in the way of the Santa Claus rally this year. He also addressed concerns from investors tempted to time the market or sell their holdings. He warned against trying to time the market, describing it as often futile. Instead, he advocated for rebalancing portfolios to align with long-term goals and risk tolerance. He suggested that the economic landscape is changing, with lower interest rates and stagnant economic growth expected moving forward. Mahn advised investors to take profits from sectors that previously led the market and consider reallocating those funds into different areas poised for future growth. He highlighted biotech as a promising sector, noting bipartisan agreement on the need to lower drug prices. This shift could lead large-cap pharmaceutical companies to seek new revenue sources, making smaller biotech firms attractive. Methodology We first sifted through online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years. We then selected the stocks with high 5-year revenue growth and high analysts' upside potential. From those we picked 15 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 5-Year Revenue CAGR: 62.43% Upside Potential as of January 15: 30.72% NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a technology company that designs and manufactures GPUs for gaming and professional markets. It also develops AI platforms, high-performance computing solutions, and self-driving car technologies to power industries like gaming, data centers, and automotive. Bank of America maintained its $190 price target for the company recently, suggesting a 27% upside potential. This optimism is driven by the release of Blackwell GPUs, which have already secured 12 months of orders. At CES 2025, the company unveiled Project DIGITS, a personal AI supercomputer powered by the new GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip. This compact system delivers petaflop-level AI performance while operating on standard household electricity. Project DIGITS is designed to empower researchers, data scientists, and students to develop and run large AI models locally. With 128GB of memory and up to 4TB of storage, the system is well-equipped to handle demanding AI workloads. In Q3 2024, NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) achieved record revenue of $35.1 billion, a 94% year-over-year surge. This was driven by a 112% increase in Data Center revenue to $30.8 billion. GPU revenue has demonstrated robust growth, surging 67% annually over the past three years. This performance is fueled by the demand for computing power necessitated by advancements in AI and ML. Manole Capital Management noted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) more than tripled in value over the past year, due to strong AI-related demand and continued revenue growth that exceeds market expectations. Here's what it said in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “As of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.” Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the best growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years. As we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks. In the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth. The investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025. The BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) supplies semiconductor infrastructure software solutions. This company stands out as a worthwhile investment due to a combination of multiple factors. Firstly, as per the final report of the fiscal year 2024, the revenue grew 44% year-over-year to a record $51.6 billion, as infrastructure software revenue increased to $21.5 billion on the successful integration of VMware. Semiconductor revenue recorded was $30.1 billion, driven by AI revenue of $12.2 billion. AI revenue that grew 220% year-on-year was driven by the company’s leading AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. Secondly, the company is collaborating with different major tech companies, including Google, Meta Platforms, ByteDance, OpenAI, and Apple, to develop custom AI server chips, which will further solidify its position in the AI accelerator market and attract investors. Additionally, the company’s other AI solutions include PCIe Gen 5.0 switches, which serve as the open, standards-based fabric of choice for AI connectivity. They draw half the power of alternatives while offering industry-leading SerDes, telemetry and diagnostic capabilities. Overall AVGO ranks 8th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks.

Title: Why Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Received Analyst Approval This Week?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Stocks That Received Analyst Approval This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other stocks that received analyst approval this week. The US market performance in the last week was quite bullish, with the S&P, DOW, and NASDAQ boasting weekly gains of 3.71%, 3.73%, and 3.84% respectively. The week marked the last full week of the outgoing Democratic government, with Donald Trump set to be sworn in early next week. Just like the last time he became President, Donald Trump is set to make some drastic changes once he takes over. His energy policy and stance on crypto will continue to be of focus for most traders. During the outgoing week, a lot of companies received the backing of Wall Street analysts, among them quite a few energy and automobile companies. We looked at a few of those companies that received a boost from analysts this week. To come up with the list of 10 stocks that received analyst approval this week, we only considered companies with a market cap of at least $1 billion. A home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together. Netflix Inc. is a global entertainment services provider that offers a wide variety of documentaries, games, TV series, and movies. The company’s target price was downgraded from $1065 to $1040 by Oppenheimer based on valuation concerns. However, the analyst acknowledged that there were hardly any business headwinds and didn’t downgrade the rating. Seaport Global upgraded the stock to Buy from Neutral, showing they were more bullish on the stock than Oppenheimer. At the end of 2024, the stock underperformed the S&P 500. Moreover, the company’s valuation is not attractive right now. At this point, investors are concerned about the continuous decline in share prices since last month. However, as the analyst ratings show, a lot of the current pessimism is priced in. The impact of the second season of Squid Game show will become apparent during this quarter and that could act as a catalyst for the stock’s next rally. There has been a huge transition in the TV and movie industry in the past 10 years. Being a streaming giant NFLX remained on top among its closest competitors (Amazon Prime Video and Disney) in terms of subscriber count. Having a high CFC ratio (the ability to pay back debt) of 22% shows its sound finances, despite having to spend large amounts of money on creating fresh content. Given all this information, Netflix is still the top choice for customers looking for streaming options. Investors can consider this downturn in price as an opportunity to re-analyze their investment strategy. Overall, NFLX ranks 9th on our list of received analyst approval this week. While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Thanks for subscribing to SatPost. Welcome to the new subscribers that joined from Tyler Cowen’s blog (for “11 Best Things of 2024”) and Tim Ferriss’ Five Bullet Friday e-mail (“Jerry Seinfeld, Ichiro Suzuki and the Pursuit of Mastery”). I am a long-time fan of both and was honored to see their recommendations. Today, we are talking about Garmin (and how the $40B+ GPS pioneer survived the iPhone, Google Maps and Apple Watch). Also this week: Why are Nordic firms so successful? TikTok Ban (?) …and them fire posts (including Zuck) “Necessity is the mother of invention.” I have no idea who made this quote. It goes hard and the internet says Plato but the inspirational bathroom poster I bought from a Thai street market says it was Confucius, so I dunno. Whoever said it, the quote kept popping into my head as I read into the history of Garmin, the hardware technology firm that makes GPS products for automotive, aviation, marine, outdoor, and fitness. My interest was piqued by the company’s +63% stock performance in 2024, sending its market cap to an all-time high of $40B+. It’s an impressive achievement when you consider that Garmin — which was founded in 1989 — almost got wiped out by huge challenges from Apple and Google. In 2008, Garmin made ~70% of its $3B+ in sales from personal GPS navigation devices for the car. That business line was completely wrecked by the combined launch of the iPhone and Google Maps in consecutive years. Then, just as the company was finding success with GPS-enabled watches for runners (growing from $0 to $1B between 2008 and 2014), Apple took another dump in Garmin’s front lawn by launching its Watch. Garmin just kept grinding it out and showed some serious corporate resilience. By 2018, Garmin’s sales were back to its previous 2008 highs but with a very different revenue mix. As shown in the chart below, Garmin has completely pivoted from a car navigation company to an outdoor and fitness tracking company with annual sales surpassing $5B. At a high level, Garmin was able to survive Big Tech because it is a vertically-integrated company that spends huge resources on R&D. This combination has allowed it to find new GPS markets, develop products for them and move quickly for the customers. Let’s walk through the story by looking at: The Invention of GPS and Founding of Garmin Pivot from Car Navigation to Outdoor & Fitness Garmin’s Secret Sauce is R&D We have to start the Garmin story in 1973. President Richard Nixon signed the Paris Peace Agreement to end the Vietnam War (after using sketchy backchannels to keep the war going so he could win the 1968 Presidential Election). Tricky Dick was also doing Watergate stuff that would force him to resign a year later. The previous president Lyndon B. Johnson died. OPEC started an oil embargo. Pink Floyd released the greatest album cover ever (“The Dark Side of the Moon”). James Blunt — who def has the funniest bio on X (“Proof that one song is all you need”) — wasn’t born yet but would randomly release a song called “1973” in 2007 (well, he says it’s because “1973” rhymes with “I will always be”). Most relevant for this article, the US Department of Defense (DoD) initiated the Global Positioning System (GPS) program to create a robust satellite navigation system. The program was designed for the military at the height of the Cold War (aiming missiles, tracking troop movements). A prototype satellite was launched in 1978 and the constellation was fully operational with 24 satellites by 1993 (curiously, Blunt hasn’t written a song about either of those years). An important detail for the early GPS days is how the US government split the network between military and civilian use. The catalyst for this change was a tragedy: in 1983, a Korean commercial airplane was flying from New York to Seoul and was shot down over Soviet airspace. President Ronald Reagan determined that the commercial availability of GPS would have likely prevented the attack and instructed the DoD to make GPS available for civilian use. They did so by creating two networks: Standard Positioning Service (SPS): Designed for civilian and commercial use, and accurate within 100 meters of a location. Precision Positioning Service (PPS): Designed for military use and accurate within 10 meters of a location. Why was the PPS 10x more accurate than the SPS? Because the DoD purposely scrambled the SPS so that enemy forces couldn’t take the civilian service and get the same capabilities as the US military. The private sector soon began experimenting with GPS technology. It was free to use but required (pretty expensive) antenna and receiver equipment. Early adopters included the oil & gas industry as well as customers that owned yachts and private planes (aka rich folk with a lot of cheddar). Two people interested in the GPS consumer market were Gary Burrell and Min Kao. Burrell was born in Kansas and had a Masters in electrical engineering from Wichita State University. Kao was born in Taiwan and moved to America to get advanced degrees including a PhD in electrical engineering from the University of Tennessee. In 1989 — when Kao was 50 and Burrell was 52 — they were both working as engineers at avionics firm AppliedSignals. The pair got to chatting and decided to launch a company that would sell GPS navigation devices. “The idea for Garmin was conceived during a casual dinner conversation with [my colleague Burrell],” says Kao about the company's founding moment in an interview with The Huffington Post in 2012. “The GPS constellation was still under construction, and it was being developed primarily for military purposes, but Gary and I began discussing its potential as the base technology for a wide array of consumer products. Our conversation became more animated when we envisioned creating products that would help guide pilots, boaters, drivers, and hikers safely and efficiently on their journeys.” They raised $4m from their own savings, family and friends to open a factory in Kansas under the name ProNav. It was the only money they ever had to raise because they came out the gate like gangbusters. The first product was released in 1990 and was a GPS navigation device for small boats and planes. It was an instant smash hit, with even the US Army purchasing their GPS devices for use in the Gulf War. A year later, they opened up a manufacturing plant in Taiwan. This early success was followed by a name change to Garmin, which combined the co-founders’ first names. The portmanteau signified that they “were personally invested in its success or failure” (side note: they definitely did the right order of names because “MinGar” would not have survived as a corporate entity for more than 6 months). By 1995, Garmin was already making $100m+ a year. Crucially, Kao and Burrell were hardcore technologists and not slick-backed hair MBAs. While Corporate America was going asset-light and outsourcing manufacturing overseas, Garmin brought more of its business in-house. They were engineering-first and owned their own distributors, warehouses, marketing teams and customer support call centres. Further, they re-invested funds into building new factories (Kansas, Taiwan), hiring R&D talent and applying for patents. Garmin’s approach had financial costs and took time but also allowed the company to quickly capitalize on new GPS-related opportunities. One such opportunity was a portable car navigator called the StreetPilot. Launched in 1998, the device — which looks quite comical now but probably gave pizza delivery drivers a massive chub — set Garmin up for an explosive decade of growth. In May 2000, President Bill Clinton put into effect a new policy that completely changed Garmin’s fortunes. According to this profile video of Garmin by CNBC, the President “issued an order for the military to stop scrambling civilian GPS technology, making it far more accurate and opening the GPS device market to all sorts of competition.” The impetus for Clinton’s decision was that the military had figured out other ways to jam enemy mis-use of the GPS network. And, of course, there were massive civilian opportunities for innovation and business. Even as the DotCom Bubble was bursting, Garmin was well-positioned as a GPS play (pun intended) and IPO’d in December 2000. Its public debut kicked off an incredible 8-year run that would see revenue 10x from $346m in 2000 to $3.5B in 2008 (when car navigation GPS devices — aka personal navigation devices (PND) — made up 70% of sales). There were competitors such as Magellan, Honeywell and TomTom but Garmin became the go-to consumer brand for GPS in the car. The sales boom was catalyzed by: growing awareness of Garmin automakers trying to soup up their vehicles improved accuracy of GPS navigation integration of WiFi for routing and traffic data lower input costs (growth in consumer demand for electronics led to a decrease in costs for items Garmin required such as microchips, LCD screens, antennas, batteries etc.) the experience curve (which is when the cost of making a product declines due to higher volumes and more learnings) The earliest GPS devices from the 1980s cost north of $10,000. Garmin’s first StreetPilot devices were ~$600 and fell to about $300 in 2008 (with way more features than the first version including voice, navigation, color and better mapping). All of this progress hit a wall in 2009. Launched in 2007, the iPhone had kicked off a smartphone revolution. Then Google Maps’ came out a year later with a price point of $0, which was slightly more appealing to customers than $300+. According to multiple anonymous sources at the company, here is a photo of the executives when they saw the launch of the Google Maps app: Over the next two years, Garmin’s sales fell from $3.5B in 2008 to $2.7B in 2010. Garmin sales wouldn’t fall any further but — as mentioned earlier — it took a decade for Garmin’s sales to get back to $3.5B. If you adjust for inflation, Garmin didn’t get back to its 2008 revenue high-water mark until 2023. The largest peak-to-trough drawdown for Garmin’s stock was ~90% (taking its market cap to under $3B in Q4 2008, with additional pain from the Great Financial Crisis). Fortunately, the company’s salvation was already cooking internally. Remember how we talked about Garmin’s commitment to R&D? Just as they had found a way to take the GPS from the ocean (boats) to air (planes) to the street (cars), Garmin’s R&D team had identified fitness as a niche market all the way back in 2003. Here’s the origin story according to Fortune: For all the time, effort, and money companies plow into the endless hunt for innovation, many of their best ideas come from within. A Procter & Gamble chemist in the 19th century figured a bar of soap that floated in the tub would enliven the bathing experience, and Ivory Soap was born. In the 1970s, a 3M employee, craving a better way to mark pages in his hymnal, modified an uncommercialized adhesive invented a few years earlier by a colleague; Post-it Notes became an iconic 3M success story. And at Garmin, a suburban Kansas maker of navigational devices for boats, planes, and cars, a group of running-obsessed employees applied their know-how to their hobby—a move that revitalized the company when it badly needed a win. It was the early 2000s, and Garmin had grown from its niche of making consumer devices utilizing the government’s global positioning system, or GPS, technology. Together with rival TomTom, Garmin dominated the market for in-car navigational devices, game-changing gadgets that marked the beginning of the end for foldable maps. GPS for personal fitness wasn’t popular before the Garmin jogging klatch began noodling. “They said, ‘We do all these GPS things. Why don’t we have a GPS product for runners?’ ” recalls Cliff Pemble, Garmin’s CEO and a 31-year company veteran. In 2003, Garmin offered its first fitness wearable, the Forerunner 101. What began as an employee side project has come to define the company nearly two decades on—especially after a lethal technology combination of the iPhone and Google Maps laid waste to Garmin’s core automotive business. The transition from car navigation to fitness GPS was far from seamless, though. Garmin’s first instinct to take on the iPhone/Google Maps disruption was to make its own mobile device. In 2008, the company collaborated with Asus to release the G60 Nuviphone, a GPS-enabled phone with a 3.5 inch screen running on Windows Mobile (lol). The Nuviphone cost $300 and if you bought it instead of just a fully-featured iPhone that was under $500 subsidized by carriers, then you were a completely lost cause and hopefully re-evaluated your entire life afterwards. However, very few people chose the “lost cause and need to re-evaluate your life” route and Garmin discontinued the product in 2010. Around this time, Garmin also took a few shots at making subscription-based apps for iPhone and Android. Nothing stuck. While these attempts at new mobile business lines didn’t take off, the aforementioned Forerunner — the pager-sized device that became the world’s first GPS-powered trainer — had catalyzed a fitness segment including watches and trackers that reached $400m in 2008 (10%+ of Garmin’s total sales). Building off that base, Garmin kept improving the form factor and integrating more features (activity tracking, training plans for niche sports, sleep coaching, stored maps, better battery life, lights). One notable outcome from Garmin’s approach is that it’s able to price discriminate to a very fine T. Customers have so many options to pay for the exact functionality they need. Garmin’s fitness segment crossed $1B for the first time in 2015. As fate would have it, Apple began selling its Watch in March of the same year. The Apple Watch has gone on to sell over 100m units and totally re-make the industry. A lot of other watchmakers have been crushed but Garmin — despite initial (and very valid) concerns — has continued to truck along even as Apple positioned its Watch as a health and fitness device. Why have Garmin watches been able to thrive? A Reddit discussion from last summer had some solid insights: “Apple Watch is a Smartwatch with fitness features, Garmin is a Fitness watch (with admittedly lacking) smartwatch features. I think if you get an Apple Watch expecting it to do Garmin'esque things you'll be disappointed, especially in terms of battery life.” “Garmin offers more and — typically with Apple’s yearly release schedule — I don’t see Apple matching Garmin’s functionality anytime soon.” [Note: Garmin fitness watches start at $300 and can get up to $3000; Apple Watch also starts at ~$300 and its fitness-focussed Ultra 2 is $1200). “Apple is still playing catch up with Garmin for running. Even with the [recent software] update, I don’t believe Apple has equivalents for Garmin’s Training Readiness, Body Battery, Race Predictor, or Daily Suggested Workouts to name a few.” “Even with all of Apple’s new updates, the big issue is still battery. You're going to be logging some substantial miles and I hated always having to make sure I had enough juice to make it through my run at the end of the day. 13-15% left on my Garmin and I can still make it a whole day.” [Note: Garmin’s highest-end watches can last up to a month with solar charging; the Apple Watch Ultra 2 lasts up to 3 days] For fitness enthusiasts, Garmin is just a much-more focussed offering. The company’s success with watches is the best example of a more general theme: Garmin continually finds niches for GPS technology and spends a ton on R&D to invent products that appeal to high-value customers in each vertical (to give an idea of Garmin's business model, its operating margin of 28% is comparable to Ferrari; Apple is at 30% but also has a massive software business to complement its hardware). Let’s unpack this strategy more in the final section. People, it’s napkin math time. Using my very subpar spreadsheet skills, I pulled up the old Garmin 10-K filings and wanted to see if the company’s R&D bonafides are reflected in the hard numbers. Here are the stats: Since 2000, Garmin’s R&D staff has averaged 26% of all full-time employees (one study from the National Science Foundation found that R&D typically made up 6%-12% of staff depending on industry and size). From 2000-2023, Garmin’s R&D spend has averaged 12% of sales. But — BUT — there was a clear trend after the iPhone/Google Maps double whammy: from 2000-2008, R&D averaged 7% of sales but since then R&D has been 14% of sales (the same splits for R&D staff is 21% of all employees from 2000-08 to 29% of all employees in the 15+ years since). In sum: Garmin clearly went hard on R&D when it realized its car GPS navigation device cash cow was toast. Instead of milking whatever business it could and cutting costs, Garmin went on the offensive and has stayed on the offensive. As a point of comparison, Garmin’s R&D spend hitting 17% of sales in 2023 is significantly more than Apple and very competitive with the leading Big Tech firms: Meta (R&D spend is 27% of sales), Amazon (15%), Alphabet (14%), Nvidia (14%), Microsoft (12%) and Apple (8%). The fruits of Garmin’s R&D outlay isn’t just in the fitness division. A scroll through the website shows countless niche GPS products for automotive (dash-cams for trucking, motorbikes, RVs etc), outdoor (satellite comms, weather tracking, emergency messaging), nautical (fishing sonar, autopilot, radar mapping) and aviation (flight controls and touchscreens). The ramped-up R&D spend over the past decade has come under Garmin’s current CEO Clifton Pemble. He took over the top spot in 2013 when Min Kao retired. Kao remains Executive Chairman and is now worth $7B, one of America’s wealthiest self-made billionaires (Burrell left Garmin's management in 2002 and became Chairman Emeritus before passing away in 2019). While the co-founders are no longer in leadership positions, Garmin’s DNA has allowed it to successfully adapt to competitive threats. We’ve discussed the company’s engineering-first approach and emphasis on R&D. Kao highlighted some other notable corporate attributes in that 2012 Huffington Post interview: Fiscally conservative: “Gary and I both are fiscally conservative by nature, and we managed our company accordingly. Our early success bred more success. We reinvested in the company and established disciplines like having cash in the bank, maintaining sufficient inventory levels, and staying debt-free. Those practices helped avoid a lot of hurdles. We pioneered new products, new markets, and systems that integrated a variety of technologies which enabled us to supply complete glass cockpits to airplanes, full lines of electronics for boats and in-dash 'infotainment' systems for cars today. Our expansion into global markets, selling directly to consumers, happened quickly and relatively smoothly.” Deep relationships with original electronic manufactures (OEMs): “Our business to business development was much more challenging. Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) businesses in aviation, marine, and automotive industries all have very long development cycles, and a very strong tendency to stay with existing suppliers instead of seeking new partners. We persevered though, and over the years, we’ve developed deep relationships with some of the world’s leading OEMs, like Cessna, Embraer, BMW, and Chrysler.” Vertically-integrated: “From the beginning though, Gary and I believed in our business model of vertical integration — a philosophy that keeps all design, manufacturing, marketing and warehouse processes in-house. By doing so, we have been able to have greater control over timelines, quality and service. It might have been easier in the short term to offload many of these functions, but in the long run, we've learned that by controlling the entire process, we’ve had higher levels of innovation, reduced risks, lower costs, and greater scalability.” Cater to customer needs: “My partner, Gary, liked to say, 'we live and die by customers' perception of our products'. By concentrating on great products that delight customers, our brand takes care of itself.” [Side note: Garmin has also spent decades working in regulated industries such as aviation and cars, so the company understands the needs of regulators around privacy and sensitive data; this understanding helps it to port GPS-related technology from one regulated industry to another] So far, this foundation has worked for Garmin to survive Biggie Big Tech (iPhone/Google Maps and Apple Watch). It’ll have to keep drawing from this tradition because the competition is relentless and has a seeming endless appetite to take a dump on Garmin’s lawns. Example: last month, Garmin sold off after Apple announced that it would enable satellite communication in its smartwatches, a direct hit on Garmin’s various satellite outdoor devices. As Confucius Jeff Bezos once said, “One of the only ways to get out of a tight box, is to invent your way out.” This issue is brought to you by Bearly AI Why are you seeing this ad? Because all my efforts to create a GPS-enabled fitness device have failed. On that note, I co-founded an AI-powered research app called Bearly AI that can save you and your team hours of work with AI-powered tools for reading (instant summaries), writing (GPT-4o, Claude Opus 200K, Grok, Gemini) and speech-to-text transcription tools (Scribe, Whisper). It’s all available in one keyboard shortcut (and an iPhone app). Use code BEARLY1 for a FREE month of the Pro Plan. Try Bearly AI The Economist has a great article on why many of Europe’s top companies are Nordic, a region that has 0.3% of world’s population (~27m) but contributes 1% of the global GDP. Top names include: LEGO (Denmark): World’s largest toy maker by revenue (and largest reason I step on extremely painful indestructible plastic bricks in my son's room every morning). IKEA (Sweden): Largest furniture maker in the world and 6th largest restaurant chain thanks to the 1B+ Swedish meatballs it sells every year (you bet your ass I get double meatball every time I go to Ikea and then wash it down with the frozen yogurt and a hot dog). Novo Nordisk (Denmark): Ozempic creator and Europe’s most valuable company (perfect way to offset the Ikea meatballs). Klarna (Sweden): Biggest buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) firm in the world. Carlsberg (Denmark): The 6th largest brewer in the world. Spotify (Sweden): The world’s #1 music streamer. Rovio and Supercell (Finland): Leading mobile game developers (“Angry Birds”, “Clash of Clans”). The magazine cites 4 reasons for Nordic corporate success (and shockingly none of them involve a sauna): Internationalization: The Nordic market is small, so ambitious firms have to build for global markets (leading US firms generate 46% of revenue domestically; that figure is just 2% for leading Nordic firms). Early adopters of technology: LEGO famously rode the plastics revolution in the 1950s and IKEA innovated furniture with flat packing. Today, Nordic firms are faster to digitize than their European counterparts (eg. much higher cloud computing usage). Government policy: Personal tax rate is high but corporate tax is in line with America. High income taxes fund social safety net programs that help de-risk the entrepreneurial route (on that note: the Heritage Foundation ranks Denmark, Norway, Sweden in the top ten of countries worldwide for economic freedom). Patient shareholders: 4/5ths of “large Nordic companies have long-term ownership, compared with 3/5ths in Europe and only 1/5th in America”, which allows for long-term thinking (private business families — Ikea, LEGO, Maersk, Wallenbergs — are also prominent in region and stymie foreign takeovers) Nordic companies have obviously taken Ls (eg. recent collapse of battery maker Northvolt; previous clapping of Nokia by iPhone). But still impressive results! *** TikTok Ban (?): This TikTok situation is wild. I’m writing this on Friday morning and here is a catch-up: The US Supreme Court upheld a law that forces TikTok — which is owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance (with the CCP on the company’s board) — to either sell the app or it will be banned in America on January 19th (Sunday). The Court determined that the app’s national security risks outweighed 1st Amendment Free Speech considerations. Functionally, a ban means that the iOS App Store and Google Play Store will stop allowing new downloads of the app and block updates (so the app will slowly degrade). TikTok said it would just shut down the app (from a PR perspective, this would make the most noise and get a groundswell of users being real PO’d). President Donald Trump takes office on January 20th and there is talk that he wants to give TikTok up to 90 days more to try to sell. There is reporting that the Chinese government — which is the ultimate decider — may allow Elon to buy TikTok. The price would be in the $50B-$100B range. This is very speculative. It’s not clear how financing would be done and whether an app sale would include the algorithm (which the Chinese government has previously said it would not sell). Prediction markets (Polymarket, Kalshi) have the probability of a full TikTok shutdown by May at 80%+. One data point for the other ~20% (aka Trump brokering a deal) is that the TikTok CEO has been invited to the Presidential Inauguration (to sit on the dais with other Big Tech CEOs). In a total hypothetical, Elon buying TikTok and combining it with X/xAI would immediately create a $100-200B company. I’ve been on the “US should ban TikTok” train for a long time and wrote about it here. The simplest argument is that having a geopolitical rival own a key communication channel is kind of absurd. During the Cold War, it would have been unfathomable for the Soviet Union to own ABC/CBS/NBC. TikTok's algorithm has been shown to boost pro-CCP and throttle anti-CCP content. Not to mention how basically every single foreign media and tech social platform is blocked in China. With over 150m+ users in the US, many creators (and related businesses) will definitely be impacted by the ban. But it’s worth noting that when India banned TikTok a few years back, most users quickly migrated to Instagram and YouTube and the disruption was short-lived. There have been a number of credible TikTok acquisition offers and the fact that the CCP won’t allow the sale — and is willing to incinerate $100B in value — is basically all you need to know about the app’s strategic significance. Since the situation is so fluid, there are definitely updates to come. In the meantime, here is a series of hysterical links related to the app’s upcoming ban. Specifically, I want to highlight a social app called Xiaohongshu, which translates to "RedNote" or really "Little Red Book" (the app’s founder says the name refers to the color of his alma-mater Stanford but it’s hard to miss the fact the “Little Red Book” is also the collection of Mao sayings that tens of millions of Chinese citizens had to memorize during the Cultural Revolution). Over the past week, 1m+ TikTok users — using hashtag #TikTokRefugees — have migrated to Little Red Book. This app is more comparable to Instagram/Pinterest, but TikTok-ers have gone to post there anyways. Some notable posts from this cultural exchange: Some legit wholesome cultural exchange. But also: American users trying to stick it to the US government by downloading a new Chinese app after the Supreme Court blocked another Chinese app, only to find that the new Chinese app severely represses speech on a number of topics. American male users trying to rizz local females (“ni hao hot shyt”). The CCP realizing that American users may spread foundational Western ideas (or, really, just complete brainrot viral trends) and telling the app to block Western posts from the rest of the app. American users helping Chinese users with English homework. Users on both TikTok and Little Red Book making jokes that they are “Chinese Spies”. One parody account of a "Chinese" user who will make you cry laughing (make sure you're sitting down for this one). Duolingo’s shares jumping +7% after a huge uptick in users trying to learn Mandarin and the company's X account posting this absolute gem: “oh so NOW you’re learning mandarin”. More to come next week, I’m sure! *** Some other links: “How Watch Duty’s wildfire tracking app became a crucial lifeline for LA” (The Verge) “Brad Pitt scammer who conned French woman out of £700,000 is tracked down in Nigeria... and revealed to be posing as another A-list star in new scam” (DailyMail) “David Lynch, Auteur Drawn to the Dark and the Dreamlike, Dies at 78” (The Hollywood Reporter) …and them fire posts (including me giving a shoutout to Atomic Habits author James Clear on New Year’s Day and him re-posting in acknowledgement that he’s locked down the “book you must buy for New Year Resolutions”): Finally, as many of you probably know, Zuck made a number of changes to Meta in recent weeks. The main thrust is that he’s dialling back Meta’s censorship regime including getting rid of third-party fact-checking (replacing it with X’s Community Notes system), moving content moderation teams from California to Texas (because of political bias in his view) and allowing people to cover topics previously throttled on Facebook, Instagram and Threads (trans, immigration and a lot of other political chatter). While he acknowledged that this could lead to more bad stuff on the platform, it also means that Meta won't be nuking millions of legitimate posts. Zuck Master Flex went on Rogan to explain his free speech stance and why he is making the changes (and someone left an amazing comment on the video: “Zuck looked at Jack Harlow and said, ‘yep, that’s my look now.’”). One reason was that the Biden administration was really pressing its thumb to censor speech and probably violating the 1st Amendment (particularly around COVID issues). Many critics note this looks like a cynical ploy to suck up to the incoming Trump administration. Yes, obviously it is. To wit: Zuck put Trump’s friend and UFC founder Dana White on the board and also made veteran Republican operator Joel Kaplan the head of Meta’s global policy team (replacing left-leaning Nick Clegg, the former Deputy PM of Britain). He also ended various DEI policies around hiring and vendor relationships. But also, Meta is a $1.5T company and it’s in his interest to have a productive relationship with government in power (especially with ongoing anti-trust cases). I do think Zuck’s position on allowing free-er speech has always been his preference. So, we'll see if he stays consistent. Either way, it basically took Elon changing Twitter/X and taking all the slings and arrows for two years — and then Trump getting re-elected — before Zuck felt he could make the move. With Zuck bringing the 3.5B users on all Meta platforms closer to X-style moderation after nearly a decade of extreme censorship pressure from government, NGOs and mainstream media to police the platform in the most Orwellian way possible…it’s pretty clear that Elon’s purchase of X was a true fork-in-the-road moment. I’ll write more on that but wanted to share memes from the funniest running joke of Meta’s pivot. On the Rogan podcast, Zuck — who has obviously been getting jacked and training MMA — said that corporate America needs to bring back “masculine energy”. And that it’s important to have the balance with feminine energy at the workplace. Anyway, here are some very related posts (including this first video clip): I started with the FR305, went to the FR310XT, FR910XT, Instinct and Fenix 6. It was a FR205 I saw on a run 2 years ago. I have them all still but just use the Instinct and Febix 6. One problem I think they have is the naming convention makes it hard to easily figure out which one has more or better features. Nice post Trung. I run regularly and am part of a large and active running club outside NYC. Just my anecdote, but almost no one in the group uses Apple devices to track runs. I think it's long-time familiarity with Garmin in part, but as this article highlights, lots of running-focused features and thinking. Also, Garmin's GPS tracking seems more accurate. Have used a Garmin 620, 610, Edge 530, and run with the basic Forerunner 45. Gets the job done with outrageously good battery life. Finally, Garmin's data ecosystem is better. Apple Health fitness/health is great but centered too much my phone. I want a dashboard. I want a desktop view! No posts Ready for more?

We recently published a list of 10 Must-Watch AI Stocks on Investors’ Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other must-watch AI stocks on investors’ radar. With everyone competing towards supremacy in artificial intelligence, the latest country to intensify its efforts has been Britain. As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence “superpower”. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers. READ ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors’ Radar Starmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy. According to the government, the technology could improve productivity by 1.5% a year, translating to an extra 47 billion pounds ($57 billion) annually over a decade. “Britain will be one of the great AI superpowers. We’re going to make the breakthroughs, we’re going to create the wealth, and we’re going to make AI work for everyone in our country”. Another country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that “the world’s AI runs on American rails” and keep it out of the hands of “malicious actors” who could use it to threaten the United States. Even though the US government may think it’s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don’t necessarily agree. “In the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance”. Chipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan. According to the chipmaker, if the restrictions are implemented, they would not “mitigate any threat” but only “weaken America’s global competitiveness” and undermine its innovation. “By attempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition—the lifeblood of innovation—the Biden Administration’s new rule threatens to squander America’s hard-won technological advantage”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Overall, AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of These 10 Firms Took A Hit on Friday. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) stands against other firms that took a hit on Friday. Wall Street’s main indices all finished in the green territory on Friday, as investors repositioned their portfolios ahead of president-elect Donald Trump’s return to office. The Dow jumped by 0.78 percent, while the S&P surged by 1 percent. Meanwhile, Nasdaq soared 1.51 percent. However, ten companies under mixed sectors bucked an overall positive market sentiment as multiple negative factors put pressure on investor sentiment. In this article, let’s look at the reasons that dragged their shares performance. To come up with the top 10 losers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. An elderly couple receiving insulin from a pharmacist, representing healthcare company's successful pharmaceutical products. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), a multinational pharmaceutical company, saw its share prices on Friday retreat by 5.27 percent to finish at $78.69 after following news that the company’s blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss treatment Wegovy are among the 15 drugs targeted for Medicare price negotiations for 2027. A report said Friday that the negotiation process was in line with outgoing president Joe Biden’s signature Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, where 15 new drugs are set to undergo a negotiation process for being among the most expensive drugs. It can be learned that drug pricing concerns have already helped drag down the company’s valuation last year, alongside increasing competition for its blockbuster obesity and diabetes medicines. Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is a Denmark-based firm that owns drug brands such as Levemir, Tresiba, NovoLog, Novolin R, and Novolin N. Overall, NVO ranks 6th on our list of firms that took a hit on Friday. While we acknowledge the potential of NVO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: How a 'low performer' label makes things worse for laid-off workers
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/low-performer-label-meta-microsoft-layoffs-impact-recruiters-experts-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-18T16:48:15Z
Full Content:
Targeting "low performers" might seem like a logical tactic for big companies looking to streamline their workforces. But when Meta and Microsoft recently announced performance-based cuts, it sparked a debate online about the potential impacts of publicly labeling someone a "low performer" — a term loaded with negative connotations. Layoffs can already be traumatic for workers, and experts say such tags only compound the issue, creating new obstacles for those back on the job hunt. "Here's the real deal — a 'low performer' at Meta could be a rockstar anywhere else," Jan Tegze, a Czech Republic-based tech recruiter, wrote in a post on LinkedIn. But now, these "people have to job hunt with this label hanging over them. Every recruiter, every hiring manager will see these headlines." Jennifer Dulski, the founder and CEO of Rising Team and a management lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, said on LinkedIn that it was "reasonable to let people go for lower performance than others on the team, and to share that reasoning with them." "However, publicly branding employees as low performers serves no one — not the individuals, not the remaining team, and not the company's reputation," she added. "That will stick with and damage many people's careers. It's unnecessary and punitive," Jonathan Shottan, chief product and content officer at Tonal, said. Previous research has suggested that finding a job may be more difficult for laid-off workers due to the stigma they may encounter among potential employers. And with job seekers also facing a slowing job market and new hurdles such as the ever-expanding rollout of AI in workplaces, the added "low performer" tag may make the job search even trickier. Others have defended Meta and Microsoft's announcements, however. "Who would you fire? Your top performers?" One LinkedIn user wrote in response to Tegze's post. "There isn't a company in the world who would let go of anyone that they didn't think was their lowest performers." "What if.... they 'are' actually low performers," another said. "Stop jumping on the let's bash Zuk bandwagon." In an internal memo seen by Business Insider earlier this week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees that he had "decided to raise the bar on performance management" and act quickly to "move out low-performers." The cuts will affect 5% of the company's workforce, equivalent to about 3,600 roles. Microsoft has not announced the number of employees it plans to let go. For those who do find themselves caught in the layoffs, experts have some tips to help ensure they give themselves the best chance of getting back to work. Writing on X, Ethan Evans, a former Amazon vice president, advised those hit by cuts targeting low performers to carefully and openly explain their situation to hiring managers. Evans said it can be natural for recruiters to wonder if an interviewee has performance problems that they should avoid and that "your ability to respond calmly and confidently will matter just as much as the actual content of your answer." "If your entire team or division was cut, this is the strongest story. Be clear about that and say, 'My entire team was cut.' Point them to a news story that verifies your claim if you can," he said. He added: "Never badmouth your old boss or company." "Just like dating, no one wants to start a relationship with someone who isn't over their ex." Business Insider contacted Meta and Microsoft for comment. Jump to

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness. The founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%. In his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis. Asness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following: “I’m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That’s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.” Following a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto. Despite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash. Our Methodology To make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. AQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $558.8 million One of the largest names in technology, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has a strong presence in both the hardware and software sectors. The company's core strength lies in providing networking and custom chips for a number of different applications. Back on December 23, 2024, UBS increased its price target for Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) to $270, up from $220, while maintaining a Buy rating. The updated artificial intelligence revenue forecasts for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 reflect roughly 20% and 40% in expected growth, respectively. This outlook was determined on the assumptions of a conservative market share, as well as anticipations around the expansion of the company's serviceable addressable market (SAM), as Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) gets ready to add two more hyperscaler clients for its AI offerings. For its fiscal fourth-quarter 2024 results, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $14.1 billion in revenue alongside an EPS of $1.42. The company's semiconductor division did incredibly well, generating about $8.2 billion in revenue driven by sustained AI demand. In comparison, the software segment didn't fare quite as well, generating $5.8 billion in revenue. Even so, the tech giant expects $14.6 billion in revenue, a 66% EBITDA margin, as well as an implied EPS of $1.51 for Q1 2025. On top of that, Broadcom counts on a sizable increase in XPU ASIC production during the second half of the year, powered by new 3nm products expected to deliver unit growth and higher average selling prices. Overall AVGO ranks 9th on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
