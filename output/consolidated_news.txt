The trend of awarding massive equity grants to CEOs with already substantial ownership is under scrutiny. These packages, intended to incentivize performance, may instead encourage detrimental behaviors and prioritize personal gain over company success. Boards are urged to prioritize shareholder interests, resist excessive compensation demands, and seek leaders driven by passion for their work rather than solely by financial incentives.

Dogecoin is making headlines in August 2025, flashing its first golden cross of the year, hinting at a potential price surge. This bullish signal, combined with a $6 million ecosystem investment, fuels speculation of a 300% rally towards $1. Historically, golden crosses have preceded significant gains for DOGE, with past instances showing price jumps.

Title: Chrome Worth $1 Trillion For Google?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/13/chrome-worth-1-trillion-for-google/
Time Published: 2025-08-13T09:00:58Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. How much is Chrome worth to Google? Perplexity AI says it’s worth $34.5 billion. We think that’s perplexing. Maybe it was a product of its own AI engine’s hallucination. Consider 3 facts to start: Google search brought in $265 billion in revenue over the last twelve months. Sure, Perplexity is so generously offering Google search to continue to be the 'default’ engine, for now. But that could change if Perplexity decides later. Who knows. Point is, why would Google want to sell access – literally the starting point to more than half the world’s population – for a pittance? Of course, the answer is – if forced by a judge. With such massive regulatory uncertainty hanging over Google, investors naturally worry about the stock’s volatility. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio, which has comfortably outperformed its benchmark – a combination of S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap index, and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. On a separate note, check out – ETH Price To $10,000? When Perplexity floated that $34.5 billion figure, it revealed a fundamental misunderstanding of Chrome’s true value proposition. Recent assessment puts Chrome’s standalone worth at up to $50 billion,[1] but even that figure misses the forest for the trees. Chrome isn’t just a browser - it's Google's gateway to digital dominance. Think about it this way: Chrome controls the digital journey for 3.5 billion users. Every search query, every ad impression, every data point collected starts with that familiar Chrome interface. You can't put a price tag on owning the front door to the internet. Perplexity’s $34.5 billion valuation suggests they’re treating Chrome like any other tech asset – maybe factoring in user base, revenue attribution and development costs. But that’s exactly where they went wrong. Chrome serves as Google's strategic choke point, drawing users into the Google ecosystem the moment they open the browser. Its address bar funnels search queries directly to Google, while deep integration with Google accounts creates a seamless experience across search, email, and other productivity tools. This isn't just about market share; it's about controlling how billions of people access and interact with the internet, solidifying Google's dominance. Perplexity seems to have missed this entirely. They’re valuing Chrome as if it’s a standalone product when it’s actually the master key to Google’s $2.4 trillion empire. For a deeper dive into how Google’s market position translates to valuation metrics, see our take on Google’s Valuation Comparison. The ongoing DOJ antitrust proceedings have created a nightmare scenario for Google that goes far beyond the $34.5 billion price tag being discussed. The regulatory pressures are mounting from multiple directions – also look at our take on Google’s $1 Trillion Lawsuit – but the Chrome divestiture represents the most immediate existential threat. If Google is forced to divest Chrome, the company faces risks that make Perplexity’s bid look like pocket change. Losing Chrome means losing the behavioral insights that power Google’s $250+ billion advertising machine. Without direct access to browsing patterns, Google's ability to build detailed user profiles and command premium advertising rates gets severely compromised. A new Chrome owner could switch default search providers overnight, potentially redirecting billions of queries to competitors like Microsoft’s Bing or emerging AI-powered search alternatives. Google's guaranteed access to 3.5 billion users vanishes instantly. Chrome users generate higher-value advertising interactions than users from other browsers. They search more frequently and in ways that are more profitable for Google’s advertising model. Different ownership could disrupt this entire revenue stream. Google Workspace loses its competitive edge over Microsoft Office 365 without Chrome’s tight integration. What’s currently a seamless ecosystem becomes fragmented web applications fighting for user attention. This couldn’t come at a worse time for Google, as Microsoft has been gaining ground on multiple fronts. In fact, Microsoft itself has been riding on a high note – see our take on MSFT Stock to $1,000? Chrome provides real-time insights into how users interact with AI search features and behavioral data necessary to train better AI models. Without this testing ground, Google can’t iterate quickly on AI search improvements or seamlessly integrate new AI capabilities. The most terrifying scenario? New owners could actively promote competing services, block Google integrations, or turn Chrome into a distribution channel for Google's rivals. So while Perplexity and other observers throw around valuations like $34.5 billion or $50 billion, they’re missing the fundamental point. Chrome’s value to Google isn’t measurable in traditional financial metrics because it’s not a standalone business – it’s the foundation upon which Google’s entire digital empire rests. Understanding this foundational role is crucial for grasping Google's growth trajectory – for more on this, see our take on Alphabet's Path To 2x Growth. The real question isn’t what Chrome is worth, but what Google becomes without it. The answer is uncomfortable for Google shareholders: a search engine company that's suddenly competing on a level playing field, without guaranteed access to billions of users, without seamless ecosystem integration, and without the data advantages that have powered its dominance for over two decades. That’s not a $34.5 billion problem. That's an existential crisis. For investors wrestling with whether such regulatory risks make Google a buy or avoid, see our analysis on Buy or Fear Google Stock. Understanding these complex regulatory and competitive dynamics is exactly why comprehensive risk assessment matters in investment decisions. Regulatory risk is just a small part of the risk assessment framework we apply while constructing the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Rocket Lab CEO Sir Peter Beck stated: "Being able to quickly build and deploy entire satellite systems is the cornerstone of future U.S. defense strategy, and with this acquisition, we're accelerating the delivery of mission critical payloads that support U.S. national security projects. This acquisition strengthens our role in building the resilient, responsive space architecture envisioned under Golden Dome, combining Geost's proven sensing technologies with Rocket Lab's ability to scale fast, secure, and integrated space solutions." Bill Gattle, CEO of Lightridge Solutions, said: "This is a pivotal next step for Geost. Becoming part of Rocket Lab enables Geost to take its sensing technologies further, faster-joining forces with a company that's redefining space system delivery. Geost is excited to partner with a team that shares a commitment to speed, innovation, and national purpose. Together, Geost and Rocket Lab can scale production, accelerate delivery, and strengthen the critical space capabilities our nation depends on." Geost will maintain operations in Arizona and Virginia, expanding Rocket Lab's U.S. footprint and adding its product assets, intellectual property, manufacturing sites, laboratories, and inventory to the company's resources.

Title: Ethereum Returns to $4,600 After 4 Years—Time to Buy the Best ERC-20 Tokens?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/best-erc-20-tokens-to-watch-as-ethereum-breaks-4600/
Time Published: 2025-08-13T08:27:55Z

Happy days are here again for Ethereum ($ETH) and its investors as the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency broke the $4,600 mark. This brings $ETH to a level unseen since late 2021. Institutional investors and Ethereum ETFs have primarily driven the rally that began earlier this month. This bullish sentiment will also have a positive impact on the wider market and top ERC-20 tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Snorter Token ($SNORT) as traders seek to diversify their investments. Growing appetite for $ETH has driven its price since the beginning of August, resulting in a record number of inflows on Monday of over $1B, based on data from SoSo Value. BlackRock has been one of the biggest winners so far, after its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF reportedly accounted for $640M of these inflows. But investors aren’t done buying $ETH just yet. On Monday, SharpLink Gaming announced a raise of $400M to growing its $ETH holdings to over $3B. Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion also expanded its Ethereum stash in a single week from 833,137 to its current holdings of over 1,150,263. This further extends the company’s lead as the biggest owner of $ETH and the third-biggest in DAT (total value of digital assets held). This flurry of activity has resulted in a 27.36% increase in Ethereum’s value in just seven days. It’s also been up by 6.93% in the last 24 hours, and is currently trading at $4,623. As Ethereum returns to its late 2021 levels, we can already expect traders to look for other investments to put their money in. ERC-20 tokens are potential winners too, especially Ethereum crypto presales. They’re typically very cheap and offer a huge growth potential, making them extremely attractive to investors. Here are three worth considering: There’s no denying that Bitcoin remains king, as it continues to attract institutional investors like Strategy, which now holds 628,946 Bitcoins, valued at $75B. You’re looking at a future Bitcoin Layer 2, which will improve transaction speed and lower the fees, while also expanding the crypto’s utility according to modern demands. The key to this is the Canonical Bridge that will let you send $BTC from Layer 1 to Layer 2 as wrapped $BTC. The latter is a high-speed environment powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), which enables fast transactions and low fees while keeping Bitcoin’s robust security intact. You only need to deposit $BTC to get started. The system will verify and mint wrapped $BTC on the Layer 2. This will allow you to use this wrapped $BTC for staking, trading, and interacting with dApps—things that aren’t possible with Bitcoin. Here’s a comprehensive guide on Bitcoin Hyper if you want to learn more about it. To support the project, you can join the Bitcoin Hyper presale and buy tokens for $0.012675 each. You can also stake your tokens, if you prefer, and earn rewards at a rate of 120% p.a. Our Bitcoin Hyper buying guide has all the details you need to get your hands on $HYPER. Our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction estimates a $0.15-$0.32 price range for the end of 2025, which would mean a 1,090%-2,430% potential growth if you invest now. Buy Bitcoin Hyper tokens today to join an upcoming revolution in Bitcoin programmability and scalability. As demand for cryptocurrencies grows, it becomes more difficult to find high-quality ones. This is the case when you’re looking for the best meme coins. It’s like playing Russian roulette sometimes, as some could be scams that could cost you your hard-earned money. This is where Snorter Token ($SNORT) comes in. With just a few clicks, you’ll be able to snipe, trade tokens, manage your portfolio, and more. The bot also comes with a honeypot and rugpull detection feature that will help keep scammers and hackers at bay. Holding its native $SNORT token opens up even more perks when Snorter Bot launches, such as low transaction fees and governance rights. Of course, you’ll also be able to use it to pay for gas fees. $SNORT is currently available for only $0.1011 via the Snorter Token presale page. The staking rewards are very generous too at 143% p.a. Alternatively, you can consider HODLing as the token could reach as much as $3.25 by 2030 based on our Snorter Token price prediction. Whether you want to HODL, trade, or stake $SNORT, now’s your chance to take part in one of this year’s best presales. Join the Snorter Token presale today. Like $DOGE that it’s trying to parody, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) started out as a joke back in 2021. But now it’s so much more than that. It’s a payment method not just in crypto payment platforms but also in retailers, restaurants, and digital wallets. The coin had its peak back in late 2021, reaching a price of around $0.000088, based on TradingView data. While it’s mostly hovered around $0.000012-$0.000015 this year, $SHIB has been quite hot lately as it grew by a considerable 12.53% in the last seven days. While some traders might argue that the coin’s glory days are behind it, there are still many who remain bullish about $SHIB. With a market capitalization of over $8B and over 1.5M wallets holding it, it’s not the type of meme coin that will go away soon. Unlike the two previous ERC-20 coins we covered, $SHIB is widely available in major exchanges. Its low price, high liquidity, and wide availability can help you practice your trading without burning a hole in your wallet. As Ethereum broke past $4,500, it’s safe to say that its rally isn’t over yet. Like Bitcoin’s surge in July, we expect institutional investors to push $ETH’s price to greater heights, with a potential to return to its $4,800 ATH set in 2021.

Title: Jobs at stake: Legislation could shield employees facing an AI threat

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. On the heels of news of layoffs at an Indian information technology (IT) behemoth that may be attributed to artificial intelligence (AI), a private member’s bill to protect employees from the use of AI in the workplace has been presented in the Rajya Sabha by Trinamool Congress member Mausam Noor. This Artificial Intelligence (Protection of Rights of Employees) Bill is narrower in scope than its European counterpart, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, which intends to cover AI risks in general. The Indian private member’s bill, in contrast, focuses squarely on employee rights in the workplace. Also Read: The AI revolution could leave women even further behind. Here's how. To understand the need for such legislation, look no further than US tech giants. Amazon, for example, has been developing machine learning algorithms since 2014 for warehouse logistics, pricing decisions, etc. One of these works as a recruitment tool by scoring candidates on a scale of one to five stars and then picking the top resume from the hundreds received for every Amazon job. In 2015, the company discovered that its algorithm favoured male candidates, as it had been trained on successful resumes of the preceding 10 years, which were mostly of male applicants. The algorithm had ‘learnt’ that male candidates were preferred. Resumes of women with pursuits such as ‘chess’ or ‘debate’ were given an even more unfavourable rating. Although Amazon initially tried to amend its algorithm, it ultimately abandoned the project. The Indian bill attempts to tackle this problem by proposing the “mitigation of biases in AI algorithms that may adversely affect employees’ rights or opportunities by regular conduct of performance audits and impact assessment." Also Read: Outrage over AI is pointless if we’re clueless about AI models Additionally, it attempts to replicate the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), whose Article 22 provides that “the data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her." In this context, the Indian bill’s text requires ‘consent’ to be obtained from an employee whose data is to be utilized. While it is a step in the right direction, the bill in its current form faces challenges. Audit and overview: The Indian bill mandates organizations to conduct an Equality Impact Assessment at five-year intervals to ensure “fairness, non-discrimination, and compliance with established rules and regulations." A five-year period in the context of AI development is like an eternity. The EU’s AI Act requires the registration of any ‘high risk’ AI system to increase transparency. Such timely registration in India would be a good idea. Also Read: AI didn’t take the job. It changed what the job is. Consent: India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA) emphasizes consent as the primary enabler of personal data processing. The Trinamool member’s AI bill too mandates ‘explicit’ consent in writing from employees who would be affected by an AI algorithm. But achieving explicit consent in a country as economically and educationally diverse as India would pose employers a challenge. While the DPDPA suggests the use of ‘consent managers’ to ensure consensual flow of personal data between data subjects and fiduciaries, how employers could ensure explicit and continued consent remains unclear. Employer versus employee rights: The DPDPA grants employers the right to process employee data for ‘legitimate uses’: “for the purposes of employment or those related to safeguarding the employer from loss or liability, such as prevention of corporate espionage, maintenance of confidentiality of trade secrets, intellectual property, classified information or provision of any service or benefit sought by a Data Principal who is an employee." Conversely, the AI bill under discussion requires Indian authorities to protect the rights of employees where they “refuse tasks or decisions solely based on AI-generated processes if they feel these violate their rights or ethical standards." It also grants them the right to review high-risk decisions made by AI processes, affording them an opportunity to “challenge choices or decisions adversely impacting their employment." A possible clash is envisaged between the rights of an employer that wants to use employee data and the rights of employees who want such data removed. Also Read: Devina Mehra: Yes, AI is coming for our jobs; it’s the old story of new tech AI implementation for payroll reduction: Perhaps to address concerns around impending layoffs arising from the adoption of AI-based models by Indian businesses, the proposed legislation requires the provision of “adequate training and up-skilling opportunities for employees affected by AI implementation" to ensure that “they can effectively adapt and engage with the technology." Given that AI models are often inducted by employers to reduce their payroll costs, it would be counter-intuitive to require organizations to incur expenditure on those it may intend to retrench. While well-intended, this clause would result in additional business expenditure. The AI bill proposed by Mausam Noor, while more narrowly focused than its EU counterpart, attempts to provide a crucial legal foundation for safeguarding employee rights in the face of increasing AI integration in the workplace and aims to address concerns about job security, discrimination and privacy. It also underscores the need for transparent, fair and human-centric AI development and deployment in a relatively labour-intensive economy such as ours. The author is an independent privacy lawyer.

Title: Ethereum outshines Bitcoin as ETH ETFs see record $1B inflows!

Ethereum just pulled off a move that left Bitcoin in the dust and it’s not just about price. Ethereum ETFs shattered records on the 11th of August, with $1.019 billion in daily inflows led by BlackRock’s ETHA, which has doubled to $10 billion in three months, fueling ETH’s rally past $4,279. Ethereum [ETH] has notched a significant milestone on Wall Street, as U.S. spot ETH ETFs raked in a record-breaking $1.019 billion in net inflows on 11th August, leaving their Bitcoin [BTC]-focused counterparts far behind. At the forefront of this surge is BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), which has crossed the $10 billion net inflow mark. This achievement comes just three months after the fund doubled its previous $5 billion total, now holding over 3.3 million ETH in its portfolio. On the 11th of August, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) saw its biggest single-day inflow since launch, adding 149,168 ETH worth approximately $640.68 million. The surge in investor activity pushed ETHA’s daily trading volume to an impressive $1.8 billion. The fund’s share price also set a new record, reaching $33.02 after a 5% jump on the 11th of August. In the last month alone, ETHA’s value has surged by 41%, and from its April low of $11.50, the ETF has skyrocketed by almost 200%. Analysts attribute the momentum to consistent ETH accumulation during June and July. While the broader digital asset market showed mixed performance with Bitcoin slipping below the $120,000 mark, Ethereum’s bullish trajectory remained intact. Over the past week, ETH has surged by 19%, far outpacing Bitcoin’s modest 4% gain. This strong performance has sparked speculation that Ethereum may be poised to reach a new all-time high. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $4,279.18, up 2.18% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. In comparison, Bitcoin was down 1.18% over the same period, trading at $118,293.89. Adding to the buzz, Vitalik Buterin outlined his long-term vision for Ethereum’s future this week. He emphasized ultra-light nodes, built-in privacy, seamless self-custody, and a fully verified tech stack. This includes everything from decentralized apps to the hardware they run on. Buterin believes this evolution will normalize trustless security across society. He compared outdated “trust me” systems to drinking unfiltered tap water. Meanwhile, market watchers noted an unexpected move from BlackRock. On the 5th of August, Arkham Intelligence reported a major blockchain transaction by the asset manager. BlackRock transferred 2,544 BTC and 101,975 ETH to Coinbase Prime from ETF-linked holdings. This sparked speculation about whether it was routine or a strategic repositioning and the move added intrigue to an already eventful week for Ethereum.

Title: Trump's tariffs keep coming. Stock markets don't seem to care.

Time Published: 2025-08-13T00:46:13Z

Morning Rundown: Trump intervenes in corporate affairs, why Arab rulers aren’t more vocal about Gaza, and people-pleasing AI chatbots fuel delusions Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time At least for now, the U.S. stock market is on board with President Donald Trump’s increasingly aggressive use of executive power when it comes to tariffs. On Tuesday, major stock indexes hit fresh all-time highs as investors digested an inflation report that was mostly tamer than feared. While the details of the report suggest an overall mixed picture for the economy, it suggested fears of large immediate price increases from Trump’s tariffs may no longer be warranted. “Many prices will end up rising in time due to tariffs, but we don’t see inflation pressures persisting,” James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, said in a note to clients. “We are in a very different situation to 2021/22 when inflation soared to 9%.” While the rate of inflation for some goods exposed to tariffs picked up in July, it was weaker for others, like appliances and apparel. Last month’s heavier price increases were instead mainly found in service sectors like airfare and auto insurance rates. “The strength was concentrated to a few specific components and not broad based,” analysts with Citi said in a note. Tariffs are costs added to imports in the form of taxes. Goldman Sachs analysts have estimated that consumers have been responsible for as much as 22% of the cost increases, with the percentage set to climb as the tariffs work their way more fully into supply chains — though Trump attacked Goldman’s estimates Tuesday. Efforts by firms to stockpile goods ahead of the tariffs’ impacts, as well as summer discounts and ongoing tariff deadline extensions by Trump, have insulated consumers from further effects. Tariffs continue to get negative reaction in surveys, with a mid-July Fox News poll showing Americans disapproved of Trump on tariffs by a 26-point margin. That was virtually unchanged from April, when Trump revealed shock new tariff levels in his Rose Garden “Liberation Day” speech announcing soaring new import duty levels. Stocks, meanwhile, continue to shrug them off. After Tuesday’s inflation report, traders increased the odds of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its next meeting in September. When markets expect the Federal Reserve to loosen financial conditions and make it easier for businesses to borrow money, stocks tend to rise because firms will have to pay less money in interest. Stocks’ recent behavior is in stark contrast to their dramatic spring sell-off in the wake of April’s “Liberation Day” speech. Investor reaction was so intense that Trump instituted a 90-day pause to reconsider what was set to be a cornerstone of his second administration’s economic policy. Today, Trump’s focus on tariffs hasn’t abated — but he has dialed back the more maximalist tariff levels he initially outlined. Combined with signs of a shakier labor market, investors are more convinced that the Fed will err on the side of supporting the economy by lowering interest rates to support overall business activity. The performance of the stock market itself isn’t a full picture of the broader economy, however. Instead, the gains of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq increasingly reflect the outsized returns of a handful of tech companies that investors believe will reap massive gains from their investments in artificial intelligence technology. The so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Alphabet (Google’s parent), Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — now account for one-third of the weighted average of the S&P 500, the broadest index of stocks Reuters reported last month, citing data from LSEG Datastream consultancy. According to analysis from Morgan Stanley, at the end of July, just 9% of companies that make up the S&P 500 were at 52-week highs. The index’s movements are thus now heavily correlated with changes to the outlook of a handful of companies. If just one of them underperforms, it can take the entire market down with it. “When a handful of stocks dominate the market ... if you do have a period of disappointment from those stocks, you could see disproportionate impacts on your portfolio from just a handful of company-specific issues,” Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede financial group, told Reuters. Small businesses remain especially vulnerable to the impact of tariffs, since they have less pricing power than larger firms. The National Federation of Independent Businesses, the country’s largest small-business trade group, reported Tuesday that a shrinking share of respondents say they are profitable. “Increased costs are affecting everyone. I believe things will improve, but it will take time — six to 12 months. I just hope small businesses can hold on that long,” the NFIB quoted an unnamed fabricated metal product manufacturing firm in Michigan as saying in a July report. The U.S. economy isn’t out of the woods yet, said Kevin Gordon, director and senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab financial group. Thursday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will report a separate measure of inflation that tracks wholesale inflation, or what producers get for their products and which tends to be more closely watched by the Federal Reserve. If it shows more pronounced signs of inflation than what Tuesday’s report suggested, stocks could quickly come down from their new highs. Barring that, conditions remain more benign than feared, he said, potentially setting the stage for further stock gains. “Weaker growth is not a concern at the moment,” he said. “Yes, there’s been some pullback, but it doesn’t mean we’re in any kind of recessionary scenario.” Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

The FT report said the new venture would compete with Elon Musk’s Neuralink, which was founded in 2016 and raised $650 million at a $9 billion valuation earlier this year. When Musk launched Neuralink, it was reported that he wanted to develop a “neural lace” that would be surgically connected to a human brain and give a person the ability to connect with a computer without having to use a keyboard, mouse or trackpad. One application explored by Neuralink includes how brain interfaces can relieve symptoms of chronic and dangerous medical conditions like epilepsy, severe depressive disorder and Parkinson’s. Neuralink announced in June that it raised $650 million in a Series E funding round and said it had made significant progress toward building brain interfaces “to help restore independence and expand what’s possible for humanity.” “Five individuals with severe paralysis are now using Neuralink to control digital and physical devices with their thoughts, marking a profound step toward helping restore independence,” the company said in a June 2 press release. In April 2024, Tether, the company behind the stablecoin USDT, announced a $200 million investment that granted it a majority stake in brain-computer-interface technology firm Blackrock Neurotech. Tether said at the time that Blackrock Neurotech is developing technologies that enable direct communication between the human brain and external devices and that the technology’s potential applications include helping people use only their thoughts to operate robotic arms, maneuver wheelchairs, surf the web or drive a car. Paolo Ardoino, CEO at Tether, said “the Brain-Computer-Interfaces of Blackrock Neurotech have the potential to open new realms of communication, rehabilitation and cognitive enhancement.” OpenAI Considering Investment in Venture to Connect Brains and Computers SEC Commissioner Says Regulator ‘Willing to Work With’ Tokenized Real-World Assets Paysafe Reports Surging eCommerce and Digital Wallet Volumes Does Gen AI in Accounting Live up to the Hype?

Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun By Michael McDonald (Bloomberg) — The Panama Canal is planning to enter the ports business with a tender for two terminals, a move that comes amid a high-profile clash between the US and China over the waterway. The Panama Canal Authority expects to open a tender to operate a port on the Atlantic coast and another on the Pacific, both of which would connect to a liquefied petroleum gas pipeline. They would be owned by the canal and likely operated by a third party, Ricaurte Vasquez, head of the authority, said during an interview Monday in New York. “We are coming into the game of port terminals,” Vasquez said. Panama’s ports have drawn intense scrutiny from Washington in recent months. US President Donald Trump has criticized Chinese influence over the canal, threatening to take back the waterway and falsely alleging that Beijing controls it. Panama President Jose Raul Mulino has repeatedly defended the canal as a Panamanian operation over which the country exercises full sovereignty. Though China has no role in operating the canal, Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. has operated ports on the Atlantic and Pacific sides. The canal authority’s plan to own ports is part of $8.5 billion in capital spending it’s proposing over the next seven years, including the LPG pipeline, a new water reservoir and roads and highways. Existing ports run by CK Hutchison subsidiary Panama Ports Co., located outside the canal’s jurisdiction, were concessioned in 1997 and use old technology. The Panama canal will seek to use newer crane technology that moves cargo more efficiently, and compete with the more modern Port of Cartagena in nearby Colombia, Vasquez said. “We believe we can leapfrog that situation and we can try to do it differently,” Vasquez said. The decision comes as Mulino said his administration will draft a national maritime logistics strategy to determine a new framework for port operations in Panama. The country’s comptroller has filed suit against a contract extension with CK Hutchison’s local unit, potentially complicating the conglomerate’s plan to sell its global terminals business to a consortium involving BlackRock Inc. The Panama Canal is seeing an unexpected windfall this year due to new US tariffs. Shippers of semi-manufactured goods and automobiles rushed to import products to the US before duties took full effect, helping boost canal revenues. The canal authority expects the front-loading of cargo to dissipate in the next fiscal year beginning in October, and forecasts revenue of around $4.4 billion next year, below roughly $5 billion this year, Vasquez said. More plentiful rainfall this year has allowed the canal authority to maintain a draft of 50 feet (15 meters), which will likely continue through the end of the year, he said. A severe drought in the previous two years forced the canal to limit transits and use new water-saving techniques. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

THE NUMBER OF dead seals washing up along Irish coasts more than doubled between 2020 and 2023, The Journal Investigates can reveal. The highest amount on record – 430 dead seals were reported to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) in 2023, figures obtained under Access to Information on the Environment (AIE) reveal. That’s a jump from 201 reports in 2020, with the significant spike causing concern among experts that more frequent, severe weather – as well as human disturbance – is impacting the protected species in Ireland. While there was a dip in seal deaths recorded for 2024 (322), the numbers have been climbing significantly from 2018, according to the figures compiled by Seal Rescue Ireland (SRI). The centre, which monitors and gathers data on deaths, say they’ve also seen a rise in emergency pup rescues during recent, extreme storms, which has caused “chaos” for the marine mammals. “If you have repeated big storm events year after year during pupping seasons, it’s going to really start to affect populations at some point,” SRI general manager Kim Townsend-Smyth told The Journal Investigates. “There’s going to be a point where, if you continue to lose the majority of your pups, that’s going to start to have an impact.” The Journal / YouTube An investigation by The Journal Investigates has found multiple factors threatening the protected species here in Ireland. Currently, climate change and human disturbance present two of the biggest risks to colonies along our coasts. Documents obtained by our team under AIE request also show that a small number of seals have been illegally targeted and killed over the last five years. Separately, the NPWS has issued a number of licences to allow for the legal killing of “problem” seals. Between 2023 and 2025, three of these permits – one per year – were granted in unknown locations, with a NPWS spokesperson only confirming these related to controlling damage to salmon stocks. Granting of the licences followed heated disputes between government officials and fishermen over seals interfering with fish stocks. We previously revealed how 11 special licences to shoot seals were issued by the NPWS to salmon farms between 2015 and 2020. Internal NPWS notes reveal how in 2020, one group of fishermen demanded a cull, calling seal numbers “out of control”, resulting in substantial financial losses due to damaged catch. However, the government department said a cull would be a “significant policy shift” which would not gain the backing of the Minister for Heritage, or the public. One NPWS ranger told the meeting the targeting of seals would “set the Twitter machine on fire”. A NPWS spokesperson told The Journal Investigates: “While seals are a protected species, the Department may issue licenses to cull individual problem seals, and affected persons can apply for such licences.” Advertisement Investigations like this don’t happen without your support… Impactful investigative reporting is powered by people like you. Support The Journal Investigates The Journal Investigates can also reveal that between 2020 and 2025, the NPWS received some reports of deceased seals with alleged “gunshot” or “blade” wounds. Emails and images, as well as WhatsApp messages, obtained under AIE request reveal the concerns were raised by both members of the public, and NPWS officials. In one incident recorded in 2020, a dead seal was found tied to a mooring buoy in west Galway. A few days later, the NPWS launched an investigation into the “strong suspicion” that a seal was shot dead close to Blackrock Castle in Cork. However, post-mortem investigations couldn’t be carried out on the carcass as a university lab was closed, and on-site veterinary inspection was not possible. As a result, no further evidence could be gathered on the cause of death. However, one official said they were “90%” sure the animal had been shot. In another disturbing report, received by NPWS in 2021, a local resident discovered the fresh body of a seal pup in the Clonpriest area of East Cork. Images show the young seal with extensive trauma to its head, with the resident stating it appeared the animal’s head flesh was “cut off with a blade of some type”. They added: “There is No Doubt in my mind that Some Person or Persons in the East Cork area are and have been for some years past Killing Seals in the Area of Knockadoon and Ballycotton to Inch bay area of east [sic]”. The incident was reported to the area’s District Conservation Officer. The next month, a further three seals were found dead in the same area and reported by another individual. An email, which included images, stated: “We have been living here since 2005 and are used to occasionally coming across a dead seal, to find three on one morning was disturbing. They added: “The dead seals were not there on Tuesday morning when my wife walked the same route.” A series of internal WhatsApp messages also note the concern over the illegal targeting of seals along the Galway coast last year. One NPWS officer noted the discovery of a seal with a “likely firearm injury”. Three old and badly decomposed seal remains were also discovered, however their cause of death couldn’t be determined. In one message, the NPWS officer, who visited the site and took pictures, described the difficulty of “tying an illegally killed seal to an individual”. He added: “Hopefully a pattern doesn’t develop here.” An image of a dead seal pictured on the Galway coast in August 2024 with what NPWS describe as a likely gunshot wound According to the internal documents, the number of seal deaths reported along coasts increased sharply from 2020 onward, coinciding with SRI’s launch of an online reporting system for the public. The Co Wexford-based centre is the country’s only organisation dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation, and release of sick, injured, and orphaned seals. The small team handles around 172 rescues per year – a figure that fluctuates sharply in response to the nation’s wild weather and rising public awareness. Sign up The Journal Investigates is dedicated to lifting the lid on how Ireland works. Our newsletter gives you an inside look at how we do this. Sign up here... Sign up You are now signed up According to data collected by the centre in 2023, Wexford had the highest number of dead seals that year, with 103 reports, followed by Donegal (69). Dublin recorded 41 deaths followed by Cork (44) and Kerry. No location data was available in the 2024 report. The latest data showed the autumn and winter months to be the deadliest for seals with 67 reports made in October, 41 in November and 42 in January. Ireland is home to two species of seal – the grey, as well as the harbour seal. The local population is estimated at between 7,000 and 10,000, according to the NPWS. Although the improved mechanism for tracking and awareness may partly explain the spike, Townsend-Smyth said the lack of necropsies – full veterinary post-mortems – carried out on seals makes it hard to see the full picture. “When we’re receiving dead seal reports, unfortunately, we can’t determine anything from a photograph,” the general manager told The Journal Investigates. “A lot of the pictures of seals that we get reported to us are in an advanced state of decomposition as well. So we can’t really [determine] anything without a proper veterinary examination. The lack of systematic necropsies is, in her view, a missed opportunity not only to detect intentional harm but also to study wider environmental threats. She said: “If there was a project in Ireland where necropsies could happen on dead seals, I think that would yield a lot of really interesting information. “Not just about potential intentional harm, but, infections out there or disease spread, or if there’s something happening pollution wise. “I think there’s so much valuable information about the marine ecosystem that could be discovered from doing necropsies.” A dead seal pictured on the Blasket Islands, Co Kerry. NPWS NPWS Asked about the lack of necropsies carried out on dead seals, a NPWS spokesperson told The Journal Investigates that it regularly assesses the seal population and is “satisfied” with numbers. The spokesperson added that “there is no evidence that the seal population has been adversely affected”. One thing SRI is sure of, is the impact of increasing Atlantic storms on Ireland’s seal population. “Two years ago, we had Storm Agnes and Storm Babet back to back,” said Townsend-Smyth. “It was chaos. “All the little white coat pups were washed off beaches and washed up somewhere else. So they were completely separated from their mums.” Repeated storm events, SRI said, is a “big concern” with “a lot of unknowns”. “So there’s a lot of potential there, I think, for not a very favourable future,” said Townsend-Smyth. “You have to take each year as it goes, look at the data that you have and collaborate with other centres to try to understand trends, and see what could be coming down the line.” Reporter: Patricia Devlin • Editor: Maria Delaney • Video Editor: Nicky Ryan • Social Media: Cliodhna Travers • Main Image Design: Lorcan O’Reilly Investigations like this don’t happen without your support...

Title: Nuclear-powered AI could make Rolls Royce UK's most valuable firm, says boss
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8772d4jzgo
Time Published: 2025-08-12T23:01:03Z

Rolls-Royce's plan to power artificial intelligence (AI) with its nuclear reactors could make it the UK's most valuable company, its boss has said. The engineering firm has signed deals to provide small modular reactors (SMRs) to the UK and Czech governments. AI has boomed in popularity since 2022, but the technology uses lots of energy, something which has raised practical and environmental concerns. Rolls-Royce chief executive Tufan Erginbilgic told the BBC it has the "potential" to become the UK's highest-valued company by overtaking the largest firms on the London Stock Exchange thanks to its SMR deals. "There is no private company in the world with the nuclear capability we have. If we are not market leader globally, we did something wrong," he said. Mr Erginbilgic has overseen a ten-fold increase in Rolls-Royce's share price since taking over in January 2023. However, he has ruled out the idea of Rolls-Royce seeking to list its shares in New York as British chip designer Arm has done and the likes of Shell and AstraZeneca have considered in the search for higher valuations. This is despite the fact that 50% of its shareholders and customers are US-based. "It's not in our plan," said Mr Erginbilgic, a Turkish energy industry veteran. "I don't agree with the idea you can only perform in the US. That's not true and hopefully we have demonstrated that." Rolls-Royce already supplies the reactors that have powered dozens of nuclear submarines. Mr Erginbilgic said the company has a massive advantage in the future market of bringing that technology on land in the form of SMRs. SMRs are not only smaller but quicker to build than traditional nuclear plants, with costs likely to come down as units are rolled out. He estimates that the world will need 400 SMRs by 2050. At a cost of up to $3bn (£2.2bn) each, that's another trillion dollar-plus market he wants and expects Rolls-Royce to dominate. The company has signed a deal to develop six SMRs for the Czech Republic and is developing three for the UK. But it remains an unproven technology. Mr Erginbilgic conceded he could not currently point to a working SMR example but said he was confident in its future potential. There are also concerns about the demands on water supplies from the data centre and SMR cooling systems. In response, companies including Google, Microsoft and Meta have signed deals to take energy from SMRs in the US when they are available. Rolls-Royce sees SMRs as key to its future, but its biggest business is aircraft engines. Already dominant in supplying engines to wide-bodied aircraft like Boeing 787 and Airbus A350, it plans to break into the next generation of narrow-bodied aircraft like the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. This market is worth $1.6tn - nine times that of the wide-bodied . Rolls-Royce is a bit player in a market that has powerful and successful leaders, and that rival Pratt and Witney lost $8bn trying and failing to break into. The market is dominated by CFM International – a joint venture between US-based GE Aerospace and French company Safran Aerospace Engines. Industry veterans told the BBC that market leaders can and will drop prices to airline customers long enough to see off a new assault on their market dominance. But Mr Erginbilgic said this is not just the biggest business opportunity for Rolls-Royce. Rather, it is "for industrial strategy... the single biggest opportunity for the UK for economic growth". "No other UK opportunity, I challenge, will match that," he said. Although BMW has owned the Rolls Royce car brand for nearly 30 years, the name of the company is still synonymous with British engineering excellence. But in the early part of this decade that shine had worn off. The company was heavily indebted, its profit margins were non-existent, and thousands of staff were being laid off. When Mr Erginbilgic took over in January 2023, he likened the company to "a burning platform". "Our cost of capital was 12%, our return was 4% so every time we invested we destroyed value," he said. Two and a half years later, the company expects to make a profit of over £3bn, its debt levels have fallen and shares have risen over 1,000% - a ten-fold rise. So how did that happen? And is Mr Erginbilgic right to think that Rolls-Royce's roll is only just starting? The timing of his appointment was fortunate according to some industry veterans. Rolls-Royce's biggest business – supplying engines to commercial airlines – has rebounded strongly from the Covid pandemic. The company's most successful product – the Trent series of aircraft engines – are at the sweet spot of profitability as the returns on investment in their development over a decade ago begin to pour into company coffers. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 arguably made it almost inevitable that its defence business would see higher spending from European governments – which has been confirmed by recent announcements. Unions have not always been fans of Mr Erginbilgic's hard-charging approach. In October 2023, one of his first major move was cutting jobs, which drew criticism from Sharon Graham, the boss of the Unite union. "This announcement appears to be about appeasing the markets and its shareholders while ignoring its workers," she said at the time. However, overall global headcount has grown from 43,000 to 45,000 since 2023 and union sources say there is "grudging respect" for Mr Erginbilgic. Those sources give him one third of the credit for the turnaround around in the company's fortunes, with a third credited to market conditions and a third to his predecessor Warren East for "steadying the ship". So does Mr Erginbilgic really believe that Rolls-Royce can be the UK's most valuable company – overtaking the likes of AstraZeneca, HSBC, and Shell? "We are now number five in the FTSE. I believe the growth potential we created in the company right now, in our existing business and our new businesses, actually yes – we have that potential." Rolls-Royce is undoubtedly a company with the wind at its back – and Tufan Erginbilgic certainly believes he has set the sails just right.

Title: Are return-to-work orders, layoffs driving moms from workforce?
URL: https://www.deseret.com/family/2025/08/12/layoffs-child-care-job-flexibility-driving-moms-from-workforce/
Time Published: 2025-08-12T21:27:50Z
Full Content:
A significant number of working moms are heading home and an analysis in The Washington Post says a dearth of child care and job layoffs are together driving the exodus. Per the Post, “The share of working mothers age 25 to 44 with young children has fallen nearly every month this year, dropping by nearly 3 percentage points between January and June, to the lowest level in more than three years,” based on an analysis of federal data by Misty Heggeness, a professor at the University of Kansas and former principal economist at the Census Bureau. Working moms got some of the credit for the job market’s post-pandemic comeback, the Post reported. But that’s changing as remote work and flexible schedules are disappearing and government layoffs have sent many others home. According to the Labor Department, roughly 212,000 women older than 20 have stopped working or seeking jobs since January. There’s an especially big drop for Black women and those ages 25 to 34, per the data. “The U.S. is the only advanced economy that’s had declining female labor force participation in the last 20 years, and a lot of that is because of lack of social safety net and caregiving supports,” Kate Bahn, chief economist at the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, told the Post. She called it a long-term trend that appears to be worsening. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in July that 57.1% of women 16 and older were in the workforce. Among those 20 and over, the share was 58.9%, compared to 70.5% of men. Time reported that 212,000 women age 20 and over have left the workforce this year, noting that “by contrast, 44,000 men have entered the workforce since January.” That article, too, quoted Heggeness. She said that between January and June, labor force participation for women ages 25 to 44 who lived with a child younger than 5 fell almost 3 percentage points, to 55.9%. “It’s a big reversal,” per Time. “The participation of those women had soared in 2022, 2023 and 2024, peaking in January 2025, as flexible work policies helped women join the workforce and generate much-needed income for their families.” The federal government ordered workers back to the office five days a week in January and so did some big companies, including Amazon, JP Morgan and AT&T. The Flex Index reported that just under a quarter of Fortune 500 companies had returned to in-office, full-time staffing by the end of the second quarter. The index tracks trends in remote work. Still, the index said just one-third of companies require everyone to work in the office; most still have hybrid work arrangements. But 43% of those are structured, with most requiring three days in the office and allowing two days remote. The index also notes that a “clear compliance gap exists.” Attendance has in some cases been low. Structured hybrid is common with large companies, while small companies tend toward flexible schedules. Julie Vogtman of National Women’s Law Center told Time that it’s “not a coincidence that women’s participation in the workforce is falling as flexibility disappears. Women capitalized on remote work and flexibility during the pandemic and stopped exiting the labor force. Now many are not able to do so.” “Women still take on the lion’s share of caregiving responsibilities, and they are more likely than men to be navigating how to meet those caregiving responsibilities while holding down a job,” she said. “They are also more likely than men to feel that they have to leave the workforce when their balancing act becomes unmanageable.” Time notes another reason women have left the workforce this year. “Some of the decline in participation comes from lower-income women in jobs that have historically had to be done in person full-time, even during the pandemic. Those women are struggling because federal dollars for childcare have declined significantly in 2025. That money helped many centers stay open and charge lower tuition than they otherwise would have. That funding ended in September 2024, forcing many centers to close or raise tuition, leaving some families without options."

Major U.S. equities indexes climbed to all-time highs Tuesday after a report showed the annual rate of inflation held stead in July, boosting expectations the Federal Reserve could decide to lower interest rates at its meeting in September. The S&P 500 rose 1.1% and the Nasdaq gained 1.4% to set closing records. The Dow added 1.1%, leaving it roughly 1% away from a new closing high. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Spirit Aviation Holdings (FLYY) warned it may be unable to continue operations, citing an insufficient cash supply and difficulties in navigating operational challenges. Shares of the low-cost airline, which emerged from bankruptcy in March, plunged more than 40%, while shares of rival carriers rose. United Airlines (UAL) shares logged Tuesday's top performance in the S&P 500, jumping 10.2%. Delta Air Lines (DAL) shares gained 9.2%. Paramount Skydance (PSKY) stock surged 8.4%. With Tuesday's push higher, shares of the newly combined entertainment giant roared back from losses posted in the prior session after the announcement of a $7.7 billion deal with TKO Group (TKO) to acquire the exclusive broadcasting rights for the sports firm's Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) franchise. Raymond James analysts suggested the UFC deal could signal the beginning of a more aggressive approach toward spending on content and sports rights by Paramount's management team, now led by Skydance Media founder David Ellison. Several semiconductor stocks also gained ground, with shares of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Onsemi (ON) adding 7.3% and 6.2%, respectively. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) advanced 3.2%. Cardinal Health (CAH) shares suffered the steepest drop in the S&P 500 on Tuesday, falling 7.2% after the company announced a $1.9 billion deal to acquire Solaris Health. With the transaction, the provider of healthcare products and services aims to expand its presence in urology markets. Cardinal revealed the planned transaction in conjunction with its fiscal fourth-quarter results. Although adjusted profits topped forecasts, revenue came in below expectations, reflecting continued pressure after last year's expiration of its contracts with pharmacy benefit manager OptumRX. Shares of Axon Enterprise (AXON), maker of the Taser and other law enforcement equipment, dropped 6.1% after SEC filings revealed that several executives sold significant stakes in the company. Investors often view sales by company insiders as an indication of wavering confidence in a stock's near-term trajectory. Axon shares tore higher at the beginning of August after the company reported strong earnings results, boosted by demand for its AI-enabled products, but the stock has given back most of those gains over the past week. Albemarle (ALB) shares slipped 3.4% on Tuesday, reversing a portion of the upswing posted in the prior session as news of a shutdown at a major mine in China suggested possible relief from oversupply in the lithium market. Albemarle, the largest producer of the key battery component, said Tuesday that its La Negra lithium processing plant in Chile was operating normally after a local official said authorities were investigating an incident that occurred last week.

August 12, 2025 16:05 ET | Source: Adagene Inc. Adagene Inc. Muzastotug (ADG126) Phase 1b/2 in MSS CRC shows 19.4-month median OS (mOS) in 10 mg/kg dose cohorts; mOS for 20 mg/kg cohorts has not yet been reached Alignment with FDA on Phase 2 and Phase 3 trial design elements. Company expects to begin enrolling patients in Phase 2 in 2H 2025 SAFEbody option exercised and up to US$25 million strategic investment by Sanofi, with cash runway extended into 2027 Sanofi will conduct a Phase 1b/2 trial in combination with ADG126 in over 100 patients Strengthened leadership team with key additions Partnered with ConjugateBio for development of bispecific ADCs SAN DIEGO and SUZHOU, China, Aug. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Adagene Inc. (“Adagene” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: ADAG), a platform-driven, clinical-stage biotechnology company transforming the discovery and development of novel antibody-based therapies, today reported financial results for the six months ended June 30, 2025, and provided corporate updates. “The first half of 2025 was tremendously important for Adagene, as we shared the early overall survival benefit with ADG126 in combination with Merck’s (known as MSD outside of the US and Canada) anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) that exceeds standard of care and is highly competitive with data from other products in development. The safety and tolerability data from ADG126 in combination with pembrolizumab in our Phase 1b/2 study in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer contributes to a large body of growing evidence that the power of CTLA-4 inhibition can be harnessed more safely with our approach utilizing conditional activation in the tumor microenvironment. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were less than 20%, which is an outstanding achievement given that ADG126 was dosed 10 to 20 times higher than the approved CTLA-4 inhibitors, in order to drive dose-dependent depletion of regulatory T-cells at the desired level inside tumors,” said Peter Luo, Ph.D., Chairman, CEO and President of R&D at Adagene. “Now that we have aligned with the FDA on Phase 2 and Phase 3 design elements, which do not require an ADG126 monotherapy arm, we have a clear line of sight into what will be required for regulatory approval. We look forward to initiating the Phase 2 study later this year.” PIPELINE HIGHLIGHTS ADG126 - Phase 1b/2 data and regulatory update: As presented at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting (Poster #248), mOS for the 10 mg/kg cohorts was 19.4 months in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC) patients free of liver metastasis (NLM), comparing favorably with historical fruquintinib benchmarks of 10.8 months from the FRESCOi study and 12.1 months from the FRESCO-2ii study for the same NLM patient population. Only 1 out of 41 patients in the 10 mg/kg cohorts was censored due to early withdrawal within the first 12 months. Median OS for the 20 mg/kg cohorts has not yet been reached. ADG126 showed a 29% confirmed overall response rate (ORR) in MSS CRC. ADG126 can be dosed at 20 mg/kg Q6W in combination with KEYTRUDA® (200 mg, Q3W) with less than 20% Grade 3 adverse events having been observed. All six responders in the 20 mg/kg cohorts remain on treatment, with four patients on study for over one year. As recently reported, Adagene has now gained alignment with the FDA on Phase 2 and Phase 3 trial design elements for ADG126, and the Company plans to begin enrollment in 2H 2025. In addition, Adagene has initiated evaluation of ADG126 plus pembrolizumab in combination with standard of care in MSS CRC patients, as approved by the Merck/Adagene joint development committee and supported by the 2021 supply agreement between the two partners. MAJOR COLLABORATIONS Sanofi: In July, Sanofi agreed to make a strategic investment of up to US$25 million in Adagene. The Company plans to use the proceeds to fund its research and development activities, including clinical development of ADG126, through a randomized Phase 2 trial in MSS CRC. To further explore the clinical potential of ADG126, Adagene will supply Sanofi with ADG126 to evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and biomarker data in combination with other anticancer therapies in over 100 patients in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in advanced solid tumors. Adagene continues to own worldwide commercial rights to ADG126. Sanofi has also exercised its option to select a third SAFEbody discovery program, utilizing Adagene’s proprietary masking technology and antibody engineering expertise. The bispecific therapeutic, with undisclosed targets, will be engineered by Adagene and induces an option exercise fee, as well as milestones and royalties as per the 2022 partnership agreement. Exelixis: Including upfront and other milestone payments, Adagene has received over US$18 million in total from Exelixis to date, under a technology license agreement to develop novel masked antibody-drug conjugate candidates. ConjugateBio: In July 2025, Adagene entered into a partnering agreement with ConjugateBio to develop novel antibody drug conjugates. Adagene will provide ConjugateBio with a proprietary antibody for use in partner companies’ bispecific ADC development programs. CORPORATE UPDATES In April, Adagene appointed John Maraganore, Ph.D. as Executive Advisor to provide strategic guidance, and to contribute to Adagene’s growth, value creation and benefit for patients. In May, Mickael Chane-Du joined Adagene as Chief Strategy Officer to promote and advance Adagene’s financing, internal strategic planning and external business development efforts. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Cash and Cash Equivalents:Cash and cash equivalents were US$62.8 million as of June 30, 2025, compared to US$85.2 million as of December 31, 2024. Total borrowings from commercial banks in China (denominated in RMB) decreased to US$6.6 million as of June 30, 2025 from US$18.2 million as of December 31, 2024. Further, the cash balance as of June 30, 2025 does not include any equity proceed received from Sanofi in July 2025. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses:R&D expenses were US$12.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to US$14.7 million for the same period in 2024. The decrease of approximately 18% in R&D expenses reflects clinical focus on and prioritization of the company’s masked, anti-CTLA-4 SAFEbody ADG126. Administrative Expenses:Administrative expenses were US$3.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to US$3.6 million for the same period in 2024. Net Loss:Net loss attributable to Adagene Inc.’s shareholders was US$13.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to US$17.0 million for the same period in 2024. Ordinary Shares Outstanding:As of June 30, 2025, there were 58,914,087 ordinary shares issued and outstanding. Each American depository share, or ADS, represents one and one quarter (1.25) ordinary shares of the company. Non-GAAP Net Loss: Non-GAAP net loss, which is defined as net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders for the period after excluding share-based compensation expenses, was US$11.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to US$14.5 million for the same period in 2024. Please refer to the section in this press release titled “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” for details. Non-GAAP Financial Measures: The company uses non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary share for the period, which are non-GAAP financial measures, in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The company believes that non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary share for the period help identify underlying trends in the company’s business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain expenses that the company includes in its loss for the period. The company believes that non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary share for the period provide useful information about its results of operations, enhances the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allows for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by its management in its financial and operational decision-making. Non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary share for the period should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to operating profit, loss for the period or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of its operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary share for the period and the reconciliation to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary share for the period here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to the company’s data. The company encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary share for the period represent net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders for the period excluding share-based compensation expenses. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense arising from the grant of stock-based awards to employees. The company believes that the exclusion of share-based compensation expenses from the net loss in the “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” assists management and investors in making meaningful period-to-period comparisons in the company's operating performance or peer group comparisons because (i) the amount of share-based compensation expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the company’s underlying performance, (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of the timing of grants of new stock-based awards, and (iii) other companies may use different forms of employee compensation or different valuation methodologies for their share-based compensation. Please see the “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” included in this press release for a full reconciliation of non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary share for the period to net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders for the period.

Title: The Foreign Attack on U.S. Energy: Exposing the Climate Cartel’s War on American Energy

He previously served four terms in the Texas House of Representatives. A decisive pushback against one of the most dangerous threats to American energy is underway. This comes as state attorneys general across the nation continue to scrutinize activist environmental groups that cripple U.S. energy, undermine markets, and threaten our national security. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced that his office is officially probing the “climate cartel,” CDP (formerly the Climate Disclosure Project) and the Science Based Targets initiative, for possible violations of the state’s consumer-protection and antitrust laws. Subpoenas have been issued to both entities to assess whether they’re coercing American companies into paying for environmental disclosures and net-zero pledges under a veneer of transparency, while consolidating market power and extracting profit from those pledges. According to the press release, Uthmeier’s investigation focuses on CDP’s model of charging companies to disclose and revise climate data, and the Science Based Targets initiative’s role validating these pledges and funneling that information back into CDP’s scoring system. The investigation will examine deceptive trade practices, whether coordination between CDP, the Science Based Targets initiative, and the financial sector amounts to market manipulation, and whether companies that decline participation are punished, an anticompetitive scheme that Florida refuses to accept. “Radical climate activists have hijacked corporate governance and weaponized it against the free market,” Uthmeier stated. “Florida will not sit back while international pressure groups shake down American companies to fund their [environmental, social, and governance] grift.” This move complements recent actions in Kansas, where Attorney General Kris Kobach urged the U.S. Department of Justice to open a federal probe into the China-backed Energy Foundation China over its suspected role in financing radical climate lawsuits targeting fossil fuel producers. The global energy race is playing out right now, and China is surging ahead. While U.S. firms battle climate litigation, foreign ESG pressure, and activist mandates, China is adding massive grid capacity, largely dependent on coal, and locking in long-term energy dominance, all while quietly funding the rules that hamper its competitors. Against this backdrop, the unraveling of ESG’s favorite instrument, the Science Based Targets initiative, is striking. Shell, Aker BP, and Enbridge recently walked away from the Science Based Targets initiative, refusing to halt development of “new oil and gas fields” by the end of 2027. These investigations must be backed up with broader reform: Federal and state policies should prohibit taxpayer dollars or government contracts from going to entities that participate in foreign-funded ESG or environmental scoring systems. Companies forced to conform to these climate cartels should be disqualified from subsidies, procurement, or pension-related investing. This legal pressure is now being matched by financial oversight. In a powerful show of unity, 21 state financial officers issued a warning to the heads of JPMorgan, BlackRock, and other financial institutions to stop using ESG metrics that discriminate against American energy producers. The letters follow a report Will Hild of Consumers’ Research and I released exposing how BlackRock continues to take action against fossil fuel companies despite claiming otherwise. Together with the attorneys general investigations, this marks a turning point in the effort to roll back the climate cartel’s influence over American business. American energy and commerce must not bow to foreign influence masquerading as ethical capital. It’s long past time to call out these global pressure networks and demand accountability. Whether via deceptive trade practices, antitrust violations, or covert influence, if laws are being broken, the perpetrators should face consequences. This wave of state leadership is more than ideological; it’s strategic. U.S. energy independence hinges on a legal environment that rewards performance, not posturing. Financial transparency should protect investors, not exploit producers. Corporate governance should empower boards to innovate, not impose tedious pledges that undermine realities. Florida’s attorney general is using “every tool of the law to stop the Climate Cartel from exploiting businesses and misleading consumers,” a bold statement of state sovereignty and consumer protection. Kansas is exposing foreign-funded litigation vendettas. If we sustain that momentum, we can reclaim our economic agency and restore objective, accountable energy policy. These actions by Uthmeier and Kobach, and the demands from state financial officers, are necessary steps in an ongoing battle. These are investigative, not symbolic. Now comes the enforcement: subpoenas, court summonses, legislative reforms. The goal must be to dismantle the cartel’s influence and reassert free enterprise. We face a global energy power play. If U.S. climate law becomes a tool of foreign influence, America loses. If ESG schemes become mandatory for access to capital, innovation stagnates, grid reliability weakens, and consumers lose. Florida and Kansas are showing how to use law, not slogans, to expose the modern climate cartel. Let’s follow their lead, demand accountability, and defend American energy dominance. American energy dominance isn’t just an ideal—it’s a necessity. And it’s time we protected it accordingly. We publish a variety of perspectives.

Title: NVDA Vs. NVDY: What Your Pick Says About Your Investing Style
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/nvda-vs-nvdy-which-is-better-nvidia-stock-buy/
Time Published: 2025-08-12T19:53:52Z
Full Content:
BySasirekha Subramanian BySasirekha Subramanian, Contributor. Nvidia is the crown jewel of the AI boom. But how you choose to invest in it, either directly through NVDA stock or indirectly via the NVDY covered call income ETF, reflects your risk appetite, time horizon and definition of returns. This article explores which option (NVDA stock vs. NVDY) is a better fit for your portfolio and what your choice reveals about your investor persona. The YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NVDY) is an actively managed fund that does not invest directly in Nvidia shares, but delivers a far higher income yield vs. NVDA. The fund’s staggering trailing twelve-month (TTM) distribution yield of nearly 80% stems from a unique strategy that generates monthly income through options without actually owning NVDA stock. To achieve this, NVDY implements a “synthetic covered call” strategy by which it To generate monthly income by selling short-term covered calls, NVDY first needs a long exposure to NVDA stock. Rather than buying NVDA shares outright, NVDY creates a cheaper, synthetic long position by This combo allows NVDY to simulate NVDA stock’s price moves, without actually buying the stock. These call and put options typically have durations of one to six months and strike prices near NVDA’s current price at the time these option contracts are executed. The synthetic long position provides NVDY with exposure that is nearly identical to owning NVDA stock. If NVDA rises, the call gains in value and if NVDA falls, the put incurs a loss. If NVDA stays flat, typically both options may expire worthless, and the fund may lose the cost of the call, but this will be offset by the premium received from the short put. Suppose NVDA stock is currently trading at $200/share. NVDY buys a call option with a strike price of $200 (at-the-money) by paying a premium of $15. (Premiums vary depending on volatility and expiration, and the $15 figures here are for illustrative purposes.) This gives NVDY the right to buy NVDA at $200. If NVDA rises to $250, the call option’s value would increase to $50. Subtracting the $15 premium paid, the net profit on the call is $35. As part of the synthetic strategy, NVDY also sells a put option with a $200 strike price, receiving a $15 premium. This gives it the obligation to buy NVDA at $200 if the price falls below that level. If NVDA drops to $150, NVDY is forced to buy at $200, incurring a $50 loss on the put. After subtracting the $15 premium received, the net loss is $35. These call and put options together form a synthetic long position, mimicking the payoff of directly owning the stock. Although synthetic ownership is more complex than buying shares directly, it is significantly more capital-efficient. For example, buying 100 shares of NVDA at $200 each would require $20,000 upfront. A synthetic long position created by buying a call and selling a put at the same $200 strike can replicate this exposure. If the premiums for both options are around $15 each, the net upfront premium may be close to zero. Since each options contract typically represents 100 shares, this setup simulates $20,000 of stock exposure with little or no net premium paid. However, this does not mean the position is free. The short put side of the trade introduces significant downside risk and typically requires substantial margin or collateral. While the strategy uses less capital than directly purchasing the stock, margin requirements and potential losses can be huge. This is an oversimplified example meant to illustrate the concept of capital efficiency. In practice, actual capital requirements and risk exposure will vary depending on market conditions and brokerage policies. Investors don’t need to worry about this nitty-gritty, NVDY fund managers will handle the complexities. NVDY then sells calls against this synthetic long position to generate income from premiums. These call options are typically short-term (expiring within one month or less) and are written at strike prices 0–15% above NVDA’s current price at the time. If NVDA’s price goes up, NVDY makes gains up to the strike price, but anything above that is capped, because the fund sold away that upside in exchange for income. If NVDA stays flat or dips slightly, NVDY retains the premium from selling the call options. This is its main source of monthly income. NVDY also holds short-term U.S. Treasuries that not only serve as collateral for the options in connection with its synthetic covered call strategy, but also earn some interest. NVDY also employs a “Covered Call Spread” strategy—a more nuanced variation of the traditional covered call—used when it anticipates a sharp short-term rise in NVDA’s price or when market conditions make spreads more advantageous than outright calls. In this strategy, NVDY sells a call option while simultaneously buying a call option with a higher strike price but the same expiration date. This approach still generates income and, if NVDA’s price surges, allows NVDY to participate in more upside than a regular covered call would. NVDA stock and NVDY are both Nvidia-focused investments but serve different goals: NVDA stock is regarded as a growth superstar, while NVDY is designed as a tactical income generator. For NVDA investors, gains and losses move in lockstep with the stock price. But, NVDY’s returns, shaped by its synthetic long structure, follow a more complicated path. So, we notice that drawdowns are more or less similar for NVDA and NVDY, but gains are capped for NVDY. So, why invest in NVDY at all? Because of the outsized income yield from NVDY that far surpasses NVDA’s. NVDY pays varying monthly distributions, while NVDA pays a penny in quarterly dividends. On a TTM basis, NVDY has paid distributions totaling $14.04/share, equating to 78.7% distribution yield based on NVDY’s last closing price of $17.85. This far surpasses NVDA’s 0.02% forward yield or annual payout of 4 cents/share on a forward basis. Price performance and Total Returns (including dividends/distributions): Even with NVDY’s hefty monthly distributions, NVDA has delivered stronger total returns. NVDY’s monthly payouts are a mix of return of capital (ROC) and ordinary income (such as option premiums and interest from Treasuries) For example: Why this breakdown matters: Return of capital isn’t taxed when received. Instead, it reduces your cost basis in the ETF, which can increase taxable capital gains when you sell. Illustration: Once your cost basis is reduced to zero, any further ROC distributions are treated entirely as capital gains for tax purposes. The income portion of the payout, however, is taxable in the year received. For July, this would mean the remaining 63% of the distribution was taxable income. Expense Ratio: YieldMax lists NVDY’s gross expense ratio as 0.99%, while many third-party sites like Yahoo Finance report the net expense ratio as 1.27%. That means an investor pays $127 annually for every $10,000 invested in NVDY. Let’s say an investor bought 1,000 shares of NVDY a year ago at around $24/share: Even after accounting for the $304.80 annual fee (1.27% of $24,000), the net income is still exceptionally high. In other words, the expense ratio barely dents NVDY’s income advantage. Since its inception on May 10, 2023, when it was trading around $20, NVDY has paid out $32.71 in distributions. Investors who purchased one share at launch would have recovered their full initial investment and realized an additional $12.71 in income. It is important to note that NVDY shareholders do not receive any dividends paid by Nvidia (NVDA) directly. But with these juicy payouts from NVDY, no investor would have missed much. When it comes to NVDA, the math is simple. You’ll need about 10× the cost of an NVDY share to buy one share of NVDA. Sell NVDA in a taxable account, and you’ll owe capital gains taxes on your profits. Sell it in a tax-advantaged account like a 401(k), and those taxes can be pushed to another day. Lower Entry Cost: NVDY trades at roughly one-tenth the price of NVDA stock, making it more accessible for smaller investors. Capital Efficiency: Through its synthetic long position strategy, NVDY can mimic exposure to thousands of dollars’ worth of NVDA stock with a minimal capital outlay. Attractive Yields - NVDY’s covered call strategy generates eye-catching yields, appealing to income-focused investors. NVDA on the other hand is coveted for its growth potential rather than dividends. Faster Capital Recovery: NVDY’s hefty and frequent payouts can help investors achieve “house money” status quickly, recovering their initial investment through distributions. This can substantially de-risk the investment. NVDA requires selling shares to realize profits. Occasional Upside Participation: when NVDA stock is expected to rally in the short-term (because of a sell-off or some positive development) NVDY employs the “Covered Call Spread” strategy, allowing more upside capture versus a standard covered call if NVDA’s price surges. Asymmetric Downside: NVDY’s synthetic long structure caps upside but leaves investors fully exposed to NVDA’s downside. High monthly income may not be able to offset losses from a sharp NVDA correction. Investor Exodus: Significant price drops in NVDY can trigger investor outflows, lowering Assets Under Management (AUM) and making it harder to generate option income efficiently, thereby creating a negative feedback loop. Distribution volatility: While NVDA offers paltry dividends, NVDY’s monthly payouts can fluctuate sharply — largely because they rely on option premium income and include return of capital. When NVDA’s implied volatility drops or NVDY’s Net Asset Value (NAV) erodes from repeated ROC payouts, the ETF’s distributions could shrink. Opportunity Cost: Historically NVDA’s returns have outpaced NVDY’s significantly. Simply holding NVDA stock may generate greater total returns than NVDY, especially during strong bull runs in tech. If you are betting on Nvidia as a core pillar of an AI-driven future, and seek full participation in Nvidia’s growth story — you’re a Growth Chaser — you pick NVDA stock. If you are comfortable with capped upside and prioritize monthly income, you’re an Income Alchemist — you choose NVDY to tactically monetize volatility and generate consistent yield. If you are looking to blend growth and income — gaining exposure to Nvidia’s long-term upside while securing a steady income stream, you hold both: NVDA for capital appreciation and NVDY for monthly payouts. That makes you the Hedged Optimist. Bottom Line In my view, NVDA stock remains the superior play with its compelling long-term returns despite the meager dividend. The NVDA stock has clearly demonstrated resilience by rebounding and reaching new heights after every sharp correction, highlighting its structural strength. On the other hand, NVDY’s low capital requirements, exceptional yield and the potential to recover capital in a reasonable time frame are alluring. However, the risks of asymmetric downside and NAV erosion — potentially shrinking the very dividends investors seek — make NVDY better suited as a tactical, smaller allocation in a portfolio. By contrast, NVDA stock deserves to be a core holding and investors may consider accumulating on any weakness, although past performance is no guarantee for future results.

Title: Watch These Intel Price Levels as Stock Jumps After CEO Meets With Trump

Intel (INTC) shares surged again Tuesday following a meeting between CEO Lip-Bu Tan and President Donald Trump on Monday. The meeting came after Trump on Fridy demanded the immediate resignation of Tan, calling him "highly conflicted" over investments in Chinese firms. The president late Monday said on this Truth Social platform that the meeting was "very interesting" and that Tan's success is "an amazing story." Trump said that members of his cabinet would continue meeting with Tan in the coming days. Trump’s meeting with the once-storied American chipmaker’s CEO followed news on Monday that AI chip giants Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have agreed to pay 15% of their China chip revenues to the U.S. government in exchange for export licenses. Intel shares were up 5% at $21.75 in late trading Tuesday, adding to the previous session's gain of 3.5%. The stock is up about 9% so far this year, roughly in line with the performance of the S&P 500 in 2025 as investors asses the impact of Tan’s strategic moves, which include divesting assets, reducing employees, and reallocating resources. Tan took over the CEO role in March. Below, we take a closer look at Intel’s chart and use technical analysis to identify price levels that investors will likely be watching. After breaking down from an ascending channel late last month, Intel shares retraced to a multi-month trading floor before finding buying interest around this key location. More recently, the stock has continued to move higher, though the price remains below the 50- and 200-day moving averages and the relative strength index sits just below its neutral reading. However, it’s worth noting that the shares registered their highest volume in more than two weeks on Monday, indicating growing interest in the chipmaker’s stock. Let’s identify key overhead areas on Intel’s chart to watch if the shares continue their recent upward momentum and also point out a major support level worth monitoring during future retracements. The first overhead area to watch sits around $22, currently just above the key moving averages. This location will likely attract significant attention on the chart near a horizontal line that stretches back to last August’s prominent stock gap. A decisive close above this price could see the stock climb to the $24 area. The shares may face selling pressure here near a range of corresponding price action on the chart between September and July. Buying through this area opens the door for a retest of resistance near $26. Investors who have bought the stock at lower prices could look for exit points around major peaks that formed on the chart in November, February and March. During future retracements in Intel’s share price, it’s worth keeping a close eye on the $19 level. This region on the chart would likely provide strong support near multiple troughs that mark the stock’s multi-month trading floor.

Title: Amazon exploiting visa programs to replace U.S. workers
URL: https://www.wnd.com/2025/08/amazon-exploiting-visa-programs-replace-u-s-workers/
Time Published: 2025-08-12T19:41:20Z
Full Content:
By Amanda Bartolotta August 12, 2025 For the graduates who cannot find jobs and the laid-off tech workers still searching for work, it can feel demeaning to hear Big Tech companies continue to claim there is a labor shortage when, in reality, there are more than enough willing and able Americans ready to step in. The repeated message that there are “no qualified Americans” does more than insult them: It leaves lasting damage that cannot be undone by simply finding new employment. However, Big Tech’s claims do not stand up to actual documented evidence. In fact, Amazon’s own filings with the U.S. Department of Labor comprise a comprehensive record of the company’s immigration submissions. And that data dismantles the “shortage” narrative, revealing a system in which loopholes are used, recruitment requirements minimized and federal certifications freely obtained for foreign labor – even as qualified Americans are sidelined. Between 2009 and 2024, Amazon filed more than 111,000 petitions for H-1B visas, a program intended for positions requiring “specialized knowledge” that cannot be filled by any qualified U.S. workers. Of these filings, 39,012 were new H-1B visa applications, while 72,726 were renewal applications for existing foreign workers. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! In addition to its H-1B activity, Amazon also made extensive use of the Department of Labor’s Program Electronic Review Management, or PERM, process. Between 2020 and 2024, the company filed 21,012 labor certification applications through PERM, an essential step for sponsoring foreign workers for permanent residency in the United States. How does the PERM process work? The PERM program is the first step in sponsoring a foreign worker for a U.S. green card (permanent residence). Before applying, an employer must test the labor market to determine if there are any qualified, willing and available U.S. workers for the job. That is the U.S. Department of Labor’s process for requiring employers to show they made a genuine effort to hire an American before receiving approval to sponsor a foreign worker. Yes, despite Amazon tech jobs being highly sought after by Americans, the company claimed that for all 21,012 roles, no qualified U.S. workers applied – essentially asserting that only the foreign workers they hired were interested in, or qualified for, those positions. Regulation on Qualifications for the Job: The batch advantage: Circumventing the law and regulations to avoid hiring Americans Wage-level “batching” is when a company reuses the same government-issued prevailing wage determination for multiple green card applications instead of getting a fresh wage review for each job. In Amazon’s case, the company obtained only 3,875 wage determinations but used them to file 21,012 applications, allowing Amazon to lock in older, lower wage rates, keep salaries down and push applications through faster while doing less recruitment for each role. About 82% of Amazon’s green card applications reused wage determinations, meaning the vast majority did not have a wage rate specific to that job. How much could Amazon save by paying below-market wages? It’s all about cheaper labor, not skilled labor This estimate is calculated by comparing the true median wages for these roles, sourced from multiple independent wage datasets, to the prevailing wage rates Amazon used when sponsoring green cards. The methodology assumes that for each job level, the difference between the market median and the prevailing wage represents the per-position savings, multiplied by the number of positions at that level. Level 1 wages: $285 million saved Level 2 wages: $434 million saved Level 3 wages: $20 million saved Total estimated savings: Over $739 million These figures are conservative estimates, while the real savings could be significantly higher. Under the prevailing wage system, the “or similarly employed” provision requires employers to use whichever is higher: the local average wage for the occupation or the wage paid to workers in similar roles. In Big Tech, market rates are typically far above local averages. If Amazon had followed this rule as intended, many roles would have been pegged to the higher Big Tech pay scale, not the lower local rate Amazon appears to have used. This suggests Amazon did not apply the provision as required, allowing it to lock in far lower wages than the market rate for similar work in their industry. Department of Labor: Prevailing Wage Information and Resources: While Amazon claims there were no qualified Americans for these roles and that the foreign workers sponsored were on “high-skilled” visas, the overwhelming use of Prevailing Wage Levels 1 and 2 tells a different story. These wage levels are typically reserved for entry-level workers with little or no experience, such as recent college graduates. This means Amazon is either abusing the prevailing wage system or abusing the visa program itself. By sponsoring these workers at entry-level rates, Amazon not only undercuts wages for equivalent American jobs, but also eliminates opportunities for U.S. graduates and early-career professionals. Once these foreign workers obtain permanent residency, they remain permanently in an already oversaturated labor market, further reducing opportunities for Americans. Amazon’s recruitment tactics: Can’t find qualified Americans … or not looking? The lawis clear: When sponsoring a foreign worker for a green card, an employer must recruit in good faith and advertise the job in a way that gives qualified U.S. workers a real, fair chance to apply. The regulations require open, accessible recruitment that mirrors how the company normally hires. Amazon’s approach has undermined that requirement. For example, the company ran vague newspaper ads in the The Seattle Times’ Sunday print edition, sometimes saying the job could be done “anywhere in the U.S.,” but requiring applicants to mail in paper resumes, rather than applying online through Amazon’s own career site. Is this legal? The Department of Justice previously sued Facebook for using similar tactics, resulting in a $14.25 million settlement in 2021. According to the DOJ’s press release about the case: “Facebook routinely reserved jobs for temporary visa holders through the PERM process. Specifically, the lawsuit alleged that, in contrast to its standard recruitment practices, Facebook used recruiting methods designed to deter U.S. workers from applying to certain positions, such as requiring applications to be submitted by mail only.” How 1 little ad was used to give 585 American jobs to foreign workers Recruitment batching is a tactic whereby a company uses a single, minimal recruitment effort, such as one newspaper ad, to satisfy the Department of Labor’s PERM recruitment requirement for hundreds of different jobs at once. Instead of advertising and recruiting separately for each open position, the company “batches” them together under one generic posting, often with vague descriptions and outdated application methods that discourage real applicants. This allows the employer to claim it “tested the labor market” without ever giving qualified Americans a meaningful opportunity to apply. Amazon has used this strategy repeatedly. In one case, the company ran a single ad in the Seattle Times for “multiple positions,” listed no clear skills or experience requirements, claimed the jobs could be done “anywhere in the U.S.,” and required resumes to be postal mailed in, completely bypassing Amazon’s own career website. That single ad was used to justify 585 PERM filings for Software Development Engineer II roles. Similar examples show the scale of batching: This approach violates both the spirit and potentially the letter of the law, both in terms of 20 CFR § 656.10(c) (bona fide job requirements) and 20 CFR § 656.17(e) (good faith recruitment), as well as the BALCA precedent, which has repeatedly held that mail-only applications, generic ads and recycled prevailing wage determinations undermine recruitment integrity. In plain terms, Amazon’s “batching” is not legitimate recruitment, but it has been very successful in avoiding hiring Americans. Regulation on Attestations: Finding that employers placed unjustified hurdles in the path of U.S. applicants in an apparent attempt to discourage their pursuit of the jobs. Out with the Americans. In with the foreign labor During Amazon’s largest reported layoff on Nov. 16, 2022, which affected approximately 10,000 employees, the company submitted 2,341 PERM labor certification applications within the federally protected period designed to prevent the displacement of U.S. workers. On each application, Amazon certified that no qualified U.S. workers were available or considered for the roles, as required by law. Despite the mass layoffs, the Department of Labor approved 2,217 of these applications, authorizing foreign labor for positions that may have been recently held by American workers who had just been terminated. Amazon layoff graphs provided by Red Line Project (Data Source: Department of Labor): Regulations on Layoffs: Amazon’s long-term use of U.S. visa and green card programs reveals a systemic strategy that leverages regulatory gaps to replace American workers with lower-cost foreign labor. Through wage-level manipulation, minimal recruitment efforts and large-scale filings timed alongside layoffs, the company has embedded a foreign labor pipeline deep into its operations while reducing domestic opportunities.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Aug. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: Solana Price Rebound Ignites Buying; Traders Stock Up on Pepe and This L2 Gem with 200x Potential

The recent surge in Solana price has reignited enthusiasm across the meme coin sector, drawing fresh attention to both the established meme coin Pepe and the hot new $LBRETT. As investors seek the next high-yield meme coin, comparisons between Solana’s performance and the rapid ascent of newer tokens like $LBRETT have intensified, especially given the ongoing presale, remarkable staking rewards, and technological advantages on offer. SOL has overcome numerous network challenges to secure its place as a top-tier crypto asset. Its high throughput, low transaction fees, and robust developer ecosystem have cemented its reputation among leading blockchains. SOL Technical indicators such as EMA and MACD signal a bullish continuation, with analysts projecting further Solana price upside in the near term. These positive forecasts are fostering increased interest in meme coins built on newer, more scalable platforms. PEPE, the prominent meme coin, has ridden waves of viral popularity and speculative trading. Despite the absence of major recent price news, its established brand presence continues to attract traders. Technical models for PEPE suggest that it remains a force in the meme coin arena. Its upside potential to explode is still there and has prompted many savvy investors to stock up on it, expecting the meme coin season to start soon. Unlike its rivals, $LBRETT is widely considered to possess the capacity to surpass both SOL and PEPE in terms of price appreciation. Analysts point to the project’s rapid community growth, innovative staking model, and presale momentum as drivers for an anticipated 200x increase from current entry levels. With the presale price rising at each round, even the current $0.004 price tag is still deeply discounted. The upside potential is drawing significant attention from both seasoned and new investors. Industry experts are predicting 200x not on hot hair, but are basing this on facts. The live presale has already raised over $190,000, underscoring rising demand. Available for immediate staking, the $LBRETT APY is exceptionally high, even though it has dropped significantly from its original 25,000%. The falling reward has created a stir in the market, with traders rushing to join and take advantage of the APY before it is too late. Layer Brett leverages high-speed, low-cost, and scalable infrastructure, benefiting from the security of Ethereum’s smart contract ecosystem and enabling fast transactions with very low gas fees. Here are just a few things that combine meme power and actual utility: With Solana price action invigorating the meme coin markets, both Pepe and $LBRETT are capturing investor interest. However, $LBRETT’s combination of explosive meme attraction, exceptional staking rewards, Layer 2 Ethereum technology, and innovative features positions it as the meme coin most likely to achieve the coveted 200x potential.Don’t Miss Out On Crypto’s Newest 100x Meme!

August 12, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, Aug. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming September 30, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) securities between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR NOVO NORDISK INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk cut its previously issued fiscal year 2025 guidance, lowering sales growth from 13-21% to 8-14%, and operating profit from 16-24% to 10-16%. The Company cited lower growth expectations for both Ozempic and Wegovy on the back of a slowdown in market expansion, competition, and the alleged continued use of compounded GLP-1s. On this news, Novo Nordisk’s stock price fell $15.06, or 21.8%, to close at $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Novo Nordisk repeatedly ignored and minimized the significance of the personalization exception for GLP-1 compounding, greatly overestimated its ability to capture patients coming off of compounded treatments, and was ultimately ill equipped to capitalize upon the purported significant unmet patient population; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than September 30, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: Crunchyroll Announces Layoffs Amid Global Reorganization

By Jamie Lang | 08/12/2025 8:11 am | Be the First to Comment! Email Address* A day after unveiling a major deal with Delta Airlines, Crunchyroll has announced a sweeping internal reorganization that includes layoffs in the U.S., new global engineering hubs, and role changes for staff. In a letter to employees, published by Variety, president Rahul Purini framed the shake-up as a proactive step to position the anime streamer for “scale and success” over the next three to five years. The changes include the creation of “centers of excellence” in the U.S., India, and Mexico, along with a shift toward regionally empowered teams. Purini stressed the move was “not a cost-cutting measure or driven by financial performance,” but rather part of a strategy to lean more deeply into anime fandom worldwide. The announcement comes amid a period of both rapid growth and mounting challenges for the Sony-owned platform. Since Sony Group Corp. bought Crunchyroll in 2021 for $1.2 billion, subscribers to its service have tripled to 15 million, and the number of new shows released each quarter has doubled. But the rising popularity of anime has brought fierce competition from the likes of Netflix, Disney, and Amazon, driving up licensing costs and making it harder for Crunchyroll to hold onto its corner of the market. Internally, the company has undergone at least three rounds of layoffs since the Sony acquisition, with staff surveys showing declining confidence in leadership. According to internal polling shared by Bloomberg, only 39% of employees recently agreed that management communicates a motivating strategy, down from 51% in a prior survey. Some current and former staffers have described the post-acquisition leadership, many from Sony’s Funimation division, as “out-of-touch” with anime fans and culture. Crunchyroll has also faced strategic setbacks. Its “25 by 25” initiative, aiming for 25 million subscribers by the end of 2025, appears increasingly out of reach. Plans to drive growth through video games and e-commerce have stumbled, with several game titles shuttered and its Right Stuf merchandise business shrinking since Sony removed adult products that had contributed to sales. Competition for top anime titles has intensified. Other top streamers have secured exclusives for key IPs such as Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, Tokyo Revengers, and Delicious in Dungeon, while major Japanese studios such as Toei and Toho have explored partnerships beyond Crunchyroll. At the same time, industry sources say rising licensing fees are squeezing margins. Despite the turbulence, Crunchyroll is pursuing new markets, offering subscriptions in India for about $1 a month, expanding dubbing into multiple local languages, and creating free, ad-supported channels on platforms like Roku and Pluto TV. The new Delta Airlines partnership, announced just a day before the layoffs, will bring over 50,000 episodes of anime to in-flight screens later this year, marking a high-profile bid to expand the brand’s reach. Whether the restructuring will stabilize internal morale and sharpen Crunchyroll’s competitive positioning remains to be seen. For now, the company’s message is one of optimism: doubling down on fandom, investing in regional teams, and betting that its blend of exclusive titles, events, and merchandise can keep pace with an increasingly crowded anime streaming market.

Title: This ‘Buffett Favorite’ Dividend Is An Incredible CEF Bargain (For Now)

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. When it comes to a closed-end fund (CEF), many investors are always focused on one thing: the dividend. It makes sense: CEFs pay 8.5% yields, on average, according to data from my CEF Insider service. But sometimes it pays to look beyond those big payouts, because by doing so, you could find a CEF with a track record so strong that its total return (dividends and gains combined) beats that of a CEF with a high yield. I don’t know about you, but I’m willing to take more of my return in the form of price gains if it means, say, doubling my money in five years! That’s been the case with the SRH Total Return Fund (STEW), whose dividend—at 3.8%—is pretty, well, meh, for a CEF. As a result, it’s often overlooked, which is what’s happening now. We can see that in the fund’s discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio), which is just under 20% today (more on this shortly). That ridiculous discount is an insult to this proven fund, which has doubled an investor’s money, with dividends reinvested, in the last half-decade. That’s a fantastic return by any measure. It even beat the S&P 500, which is up around 103% since then. The funny thing is, the strategy behind this money-making fund is simple, which is why its bargain valuation is so surprising. Inspired by Warren Buffett, STEW uses a value-investing approach that makes the fund less volatile than the broader market while helping it rise in value over the long haul. Its largest investment is in Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B), which is about 45% of the fund’s assets. Additionally, STEW looks for valuable underpriced stocks, which is why it also holds JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), pipeline operator Enterprise Products Partners (EPD), Microsoft (MSFT) and other high-quality firms with long histories of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. This is all good stuff, but now let me show you the best part: that bargain valuation I mentioned a second ago. This is where a big difference between CEFs and ETFs comes in: ETFs can issue shares as necessary, so they don’t trade at discounts (or at least significant ones). But STEW, as a CEF, has a fixed number of shares (hence the “closed” in the term “closed-end fund”). As a result, a CEF’s shares can trade up or down depending on market demand, in addition to their movements on the value of the fund’s assets. That, in turn, means CEFs can sometimes trade well below NAV. And STEW’s discount, as I mentioned a second ago, is truly massive: just under 20%! Note that this markdown was even wider in recent months. In fact, STEW’s discount has slowly grown larger over the last five years despite the fact that the fund beat the market. This inefficiency can’t last, which is why STEW’s discount suddenly shrank in recent weeks. Its discount is likely to shrink further as more investors catch on. All of this might sound familiar if you’ve been reading my articles for a while, because in a March 31, 2025, piece, I pointed out that STEW’s massive (then 23.1%) discount was unlikely to last. It has shrunk a bit since then, and I see it shrinking more. Now, let me wheel back to the dividend part of the picture here. To be sure, that 3.8% payout is, as mentioned, on the small side for a CEF. But it’s also masking something else, besides STEW’s strong total return: dividend growth. That too has been strong, with the payout soaring 62% in the last five years. And lately, STEW’s payout growth has been accelerating: It’s just another reason why with CEFs (or any income investment, really), it pays to look beyond the yield. STEW, with its discount, performance history and growing payout, is a perfect example of that. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

One of the most eagerly awaited astronomical events of the year – which promised one or two meteors or “shooting stars” a minute – is set to continue in Irish skies on Wednesday night. Tuesday night saw about 60 meteors an hour darting across the sky and stargazers can expect about half that amount on Wednesday night. “The Perseids will be half as strong tonight as they were last night, so that’s still 10 times more meteors tonight than a normal night, so well worth viewing,” said David Moore from astronomy.ie. “The best time to view is dusk until dawn,” he said. “We had people sending us counts of how many they saw every 15 minutes from 10:30pm last night when it got dark enough to see them. I saw some after 4am when dawn was breaking.” “Dublin gets much the same view as the rest of the country, indeed, all of Europe,” Mr Moore said. “This year the moon is in the sky so even those in the countryside will have moonlit skies so even suburban viewers will get the same view.” Met Éireann has forecast a humid night with clear spells on Wednesday, however a few showers are possible which could be heavy or thundery. Mr Moore advised stargazers to ensure they are comfortable while looking up. “Standing with your neck craned back for hours is not comfortable. “Look anywhere in the sky. If there are clouds look in the clear patches. If totally clear stand with your back to the moon so it does not dazzle you,” he said. “The paths of the meteors will all point back to the constellation Perseus but you do not have to look at Perseus.” The Perseid meteors are caused by dust particles shed by the comet Swift-Tuttle. The comet, which takes 133 years to orbit the sun, was last seen in Irish skies in 1992. At this time of year, Earth moves through this debris cloud, making one of the most celebrated astronomical events and arguably the most predictable. Particles from the debris cloud subsequently burn up on entering Earth’s atmosphere and create flashes of light. The shower is active for several weeks. “It’s such a special time of the year,” said astronomer Danielle Wilcox from Blackrock Castle Observatory, Cork. “It’s a really good meteor shower in particular because it gives us a lot of meteors per hour compared to other meteor showers,” she said. “That’s what’s so exciting about it, especially for people who have never seen ‘shooting stars’, this is your chance to get out there and see that,” she said. “Take some time to look up,” she said.

Title: XRP Double-Bottom Breakout Sets Sights On $34, Predicts Analyst

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Gert van Lagen says the macro structure of XRP has finally done the one thing it needed to do: break the neckline of a seven-year base and hold it. “XRP [2W] – Ripple is ready to rip. The 7-year double bottom has broken out at ❌ The neckline was successfully retested at 🔵 ATH cleared — first target near ~$34, at 2.00 fib. extension of double bottom. → Compare with 2014–2017 setup,” the analyst wrote. His chart is drawn on a logarithmic scale with two-week candles, framing the move as a multi-cycle reversal rather than a short-term pop. The geometry is clear on the chart. A broad W-shaped base stretching from the 2018–2024 bear market carved twin lows in the sub-$0.20–$0.30 region, then returned to a horizontal neckline that sits just above the $2 handle. Van Lagen marks an initial breakout attempt with a red cross just over that barrier, followed by a decisive surge and a pullback that tags support around the $2 area, annotated with a blue dot. On a log chart, that textbook breakout-retest sequence is the confirmation step technicians typically look for before projecting targets. Price at the time of the snapshot is labeled $3.19 on the right axis, meaning XRP is trading above the neckline but still below the 2018 all-time high at $3.40. That placement matters because the prior macro cap now acts as support; staying north of roughly $2.00 keeps the double-bottom thesis intact. The measured arrow drawn from the neckline replicates the height of the base on a multiplicative (log) basis, which is why the upside extension leaps into the mid-double digits rather than adding only a few dollars. Van Lagen’s first objective is derived explicitly from Fibonacci proportions. He sets the 2.00 extension of the double-bottom as the initial target, landing “near ~$34.” On his scale the projected path peaks above the $27 and $20 grid lines and briefly tags the mid-$30s before mean-reverting, consistent with how log-scale extensions translate when a long consolidation unwinds quickly. The left side of the graphic provides the historical rhyme he wants readers to notice. Between 2014 and 2017, XRP built a smaller double-bottom within a shaded accumulation zone, broke its neckline, retested it, and then accelerated vertically. Van Lagen marks that sequence with the same red cross at breakout and blue dot at the retest, plus a vertical measuring arrow to illustrate how the earlier base resolved. The current pattern, shaded across 2018–2025, repeats that choreography at a far larger scale. His sketch includes a time-and-price roadmap using twelve forward candles—two-week bars—implying a five- to six-month arc for the entire move if it were to echo the prior cycle. The first projected bar vaults XRP above $11. After three candles, the blue path tops out above $36, roughly six weeks into the run. The fourth candle traces a deep retracement back toward the $11 region, followed by a sharp recovery above $30 on the fifth. The next three candles stabilize around the $30 area before the path draws another slide to ~$11 and the onset of a cooling phase. The sequence is illustrative rather than prescriptive, but it visually anchors the extension math to possible market behavior. Whether XRP can follow the steep path sketched in blue is a separate question from whether the double-bottom has technically activated. Van Lagen’s chart answers the second with a yes: the breakout and retest sequence is complete. The first answer—delivery toward the ~$34 Fib extension—will be determined by how the next several two-week candles will look like. At press time, XRP traded at $3.14.

Title: How deals with Apple and Trump’s Pentagon turned rare earth miner MP Materials into a red-hot stock
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/08/12/rare-earths-magnets-mp-materials-stock-surge-landmark-deals-trump-apple/
Time Published: 2025-08-12T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Jordan Blum is the Energy editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of a growing global energy sector for oil and gas, transition businesses, renewables, and critical minerals. California miner MP Materials struck metaphorical gold in July when it announced a landmark deal with the Trump administration to make the Defense Department its largest shareholder, followed up days later by an expansion agreement with Apple. But what MP actually mines—so-called rare earth elements that are central to many of the world’s most important technologies—appears to be even more precious than gold to investors. MP is the nation’s only rare earths miner, at a time when the U.S. aspires to compete against China’s supply-chain dominance in the field. Its share price has spiked an astonishing 365% year to date, including a 150% surge in just over a month. MP’s market cap has risen from just over $2 billion to $13 billion, entering large-cap territory—not bad for a company that brought in just $204 million in revenue last year. It’s a rise comparable to that of Silicon Valley defense firm Palantir—but with all due respect to that AI-fueled company, Palantir’s stock has risen by only 140% year to date. “I give MP credit for having the foresight and for being in the right place at the right time,” Ben Kallo, Baird senior research analyst, told Fortune. “I think it’s surprising because I didn’t believe the government would react in such a quick and forceful way. “I think the fire is in the belly of supply-chain managers to move away from China right now.” MP also is the nation’s only vertically integrated miner and specialty magnets producer, having just opened a metals and neodymium magnets plant in Fort Worth. Not one to miss a marketing opportunity, MP named that plant “Independence.” The powerful magnets are as critically important as they are little-known. They are used in electric vehicles, renewable energy, mobile phones, military equipment, and, most recently, AI data centers. General Motors was MP’s first flagship customer for magnets. From a military standpoint, the magnets are just as crucial: They’re used in drones, fighter jets, missile systems, and nuclear submarines. More than 80% of the world’s neodymium magnet supply is manufactured in China. The U.S. counts a few manufacturers, while China has a few hundred. “Rare earth” materials actually are not rare, but they are expensive to separate and refine. That growth takes financial support. The Defense Department bought $400 million worth of MP shares in July to become a 15% shareholder; on Aug. 10, it backed up its initial deal with an additional $150 million loan to MP to help expand its mining operations in Mountain Pass, Calif. “We are taking decisive action to restore our domestic critical minerals supply chain, revive our industrial base, and rebuild our military to achieve President Trump’s goal of peace through strength,” said Emil Michael, defense undersecretary for research and engineering, in a statement. Michael is a former top executive at Uber. Even apart from the military, both MP and the administration see the company growing because of the AI boom. “We have the platform, the partners, and the perspective to seize another enormous runway of opportunity,” said MP founder, chairman, and CEO James Litinsky on the company’s Aug. 7 earnings call. “And it does not hurt that we have a front-row seat and an important role in what may well become the most significant business transformation of our generation, the era of physical AI.” MP is built on the ashes of the former mine owner Molycorp and its Mountain Pass facilities. A decade ago, Molycorp was failing because of heavy indebtedness and China’s price dumping into the global rare earths markets. Seeing the thesis case for domestic rare earths mining, Litinsky and his eponymously named JHL Capital Group hedge fund bought into Molycorp’s bonds during its 2015 bankruptcy proceedings. Litinsky eventually folded his fund to buy the Mountain Pass assets outright and form MP Materials in 2017. Litinsky had previously worked at the New York–based Fortress Investment Group, and MP Materials went public in 2020 when it merged with one of Fortress’s several special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, in a $1.47 billion deal. “One of the biggest question marks and pushback was, ‘How can these finance guys operate a mine and make it work?’” Kallo said. But MP cleaned up its mining operations, kept debt low, and focused on vertical integration and growth. “They’ve surprised to the upside.” The Independence plant opened in January, and MP was looking at a smoother growth trajectory. But in the spring, the onslaught of Trump’s tariff war shook things up, and companies began to realize they shouldn’t rely on Chinese supply chains so heavily. “A lot of companies didn’t realize their magnets came from China,” Kallo said. “It woke a lot of people up. These magnets go into everything.” This is when the Wall Street–ization of the Defense Department under the second Trump administration came into play. Steve Feinberg, the new U.S. deputy secretary of defense, is the billionaire cofounder of Cerberus Capital Management. Feinberg spearheaded the unusual, landmark deal with Litinsky. It not only made the Pentagon a 15% shareholder, it included the pledge of a multibillion-dollar total investment as MP aims to expand its magnet production capacity 10-fold. That expansion is expected to be completed in 2028. The deal also puts a floor on pricing for MP’s rare earth materials for 10 years, helping offset the possibility of foreign price dumping. A Defense Department spokesperson told Fortune: “Rebuilding the critical minerals and rare earth magnet sectors of the U.S. industrial base won’t happen overnight, but DOD is taking immediate action to streamline processes and identify opportunities to strengthen critical minerals production.” Four days after the Pentagon deal announcement, on July 15, MP announced a $500 million partnership with Apple to supply rare earth magnets that are fully manufactured from recycled materials, a pledge that would entail recycling expansions at both the Mountain Pass and Fort Worth facilities. MP and Apple had piloted advanced recycling technologies for five years before announcing the deal. “American innovation drives everything we do at Apple, and we’re proud to deepen our investment in the U.S. economy,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a statement. “Rare earth materials are essential for making advanced technology, and this partnership will help strengthen the supply of these vital materials here in the United States.” MP used to ship more of its raw materials to China because of a lack of U.S. refining capacity. One potential stumbling block for MP was its smaller ownership stake still held by China’s Shenghe Resources, which had helped Litinsky buy out Molycorp in 2017. But the larger U.S. government ownership position combined with the new pricing floor and Chinese tariffs on U.S. exports has allowed MP to cease its exports to China as of April. “We are maniacally focused on investing and executing in the United States of America,” Litinsky said on his earnings call. He emphasized, “Through years of relentless execution, this team has transformed a bankrupted and abandoned mine site into a vertically integrated American national champion with a strategic and economic platform that matters.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Bullish Cryptocurrency Exchange Expands IPO Plans To $5 Billion

Peter Thiel-backed cryptocurrency exchange Bullish has announced a significant increase in the size of its initial public offering (IPO), aiming to raise approximately $990 million. According to a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company plans to offer 30 million shares priced between $32 and $33 each, targeting a market valuation of around $4.8 billion. This marks a notable shift from its earlier proposal, which included the sale of 20.3 million shares at a lower price range of $28 to $31, with a valuation goal of $4.2 billion. Led by former New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) president Tom Farley, Bullish has granted its underwriters—comprising JPMorgan, Jefferies, and Citigroup—a 30-day option to sell an additional 4.5 million shares. Once the new offering is completed, the crypto exchange’s stock will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “BLSH.” In a show of confidence, major investment firms such as the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, and Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management, have expressed interest in acquiring up to $200 million worth of BLSH shares. This interest reflects a broader trend of renewed investor enthusiasm and regulatory support for the cryptocurrency sector under President Donald Trump’s new administration, as evidenced by recent successful market entries, including the notable debut of stablecoin issuer Circle (CRLC). The Bullish crypto exchange founded in the “year of the bull,” 2021, has also outlined plans to convert a significant portion of the initial public offering proceeds into stablecoins, collaborating with one or more dollar-pegged cryptocurrency issuers to facilitate this transition. This decision follows the recent signing of the GENIUS Act into law by President Donald Trump. The country’s first crypto bill establishes a new framework for stablecoins to thrive and integrate into the traditional finance sector. Despite its ambitious plans and the positive market climate, Bullish reported a loss of $349 million for the quarter ending March 31, a stark contrast to the $105 million profit it recorded during the same period last year. As Bullish prepares for its IPO, it joins a wave of crypto firms entering public markets, including Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital, which recently uplisted to Nasdaq, and eToro, which has opened trading to the public. Additionally, crypto custody startup BitGo and the Winklevoss-run Gemini crypto exchange have both confidentially filed for US listings, signaling a renewed interest in cryptocurrency investments under a more favorable regulatory environment in the US. Amid these developments, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization hit a new record high of $4 trillion on Monday, with Bitcoin (BTC) once again surpassing the $120,000 threshold. However, despite Monday’s early momentum, the total market cap has since retraced and stabilized at around $3.93 trillion.

Title: Tesla’s Stock's Next Surge: 4 Catalysts To Watch
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/12/teslas-stocks-next-surge-4-catalysts-to-watch/
Time Published: 2025-08-12T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) has encountered a challenging year in 2025, marked by political conflicts, declining sales, and increasing competition. Nonetheless, it might not be entirely bleak for Tesla, as a series of new catalysts could be rejuvenating the stock’s long-term bullish outlook. With opportunities presented by AI and a favorable cost structure in a changing tariff environment, Tesla is regaining the attention of investors, and its shares have appreciated nearly 6% in the last five trading days. While valuations remain high at approximately 195x forward earnings, the narrative might be shifting in favor of Tesla. Here’s a brief overview of the positive factors fostering optimism in the stock. Elon Musk’s significant and very visible discord with President Donald Trump, following a brief political alliance during the 2024 campaign and initial months of the Trump presidency, created uncertainty regarding Tesla’s regulatory outlook. However, public sentiment seems to be changing. Recently, Trump has softened his rhetoric, stating, “I desire for Elon’s business to thrive,” and has generally been more lenient towards his friend-turned-adversary. While there are still policy risks, a more amicable relationship could alleviate a major burden. In addition, Elon Musk is back in charge at Tesla after a temporary stay in Washington, now fully concentrating on Tesla’s mission – enhancing EV production, launching robotaxis, and envisioning AI-powered robotics. Tesla has recently communicated to its shareholders a new compensation agreement for Musk, which includes 96 million restricted shares valued potentially at nearly $30 billion, contingent on ambitious performance targets. This indicates that Musk is directly motivated to provide substantial returns for shareholders. However, investing in a single stock carries considerable risk. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio is intended to mitigate stock-specific risk while still offering upside potential. AI computing has been the most significant trend in the technology sector over the past three years, driving valuations to unmatched levels. Nvidia is now valued at nearly $4.5 trillion and Broadcom around $1.5 trillion, primarily due to the demand for AI computing infrastructure. Just as AI computing became the foundational component for the digital AI explosion, “physical AI” might emerge as the next significant opportunity. We believe that the markets could be beginning to perceive Tesla as a type of proxy for physical AI. The company uniquely integrates cutting-edge software, advanced hardware, and extensive manufacturing know-how – three essential elements for leading this budding sector. Tesla’s extensive experience in autonomous driving has provided it with a substantial advantage in AI software, its robotics proficiency is deeply ingrained in its highly automated factories, and its vertical integration ensures oversight from chip design to final assembly. Besides self-driving vehicles, Optimus, Tesla’s humanoid robot designed to carry out repetitive, hazardous, or mundane tasks in factories, warehouses, and homes, could represent a significant revenue stream for Tesla. The goal for Tesla is to mass-produce millions of units annually by 2030 at a price point below $20,000, thus opening a new market with immense potential. Unlike many small robotics startups, Tesla possesses the financial resources, engineering expertise, and manufacturing capacity to transition from prototype to mass production. Check the analysis on How Tesla stock soars to $1500 While Tesla’s deliveries declined by 13.5% to 384,122 vehicles in Q2, investors seem to be overlooking this drop. Recent regulatory alterations under the Trump Administration, which are generally viewed as detrimental for the automotive industry, might actually benefit Tesla. A 25% tariff on all imported passenger vehicles and light trucks was implemented in April 2025, followed by tariffs on specific imported auto components in May. Tesla could emerge as a net winner, building all U.S. vehicles in California and Texas, thereby avoiding these tariffs, while competitors such as GM and Ford manufacture some EVs in Mexico and may incur higher costs. As these tariffs ripple through the supply chain, Tesla’s price competitiveness could enhance, aiding it in defending and expanding its U.S. market share. Furthermore, although the federal electric vehicle mandate has been eliminated, Tesla’s standing as one of the lowest-cost EV manufacturers remains solid, giving it an edge over other competitors who may have leaned more heavily to compensate for a higher cost structure. The company’s prudent management of fixed costs, including R&D and SG&A, has allowed it to maintain profitability even in tough market conditions. Also see: Will Slowing Cloud Business drag Amazon stock to $100? One of the most exciting prospects for Tesla could be its robotaxi service. Admittedly, Tesla will need to catch up to Google's Waymo, which has been providing autonomous rides in several cities for nearly five years. Nevertheless, Tesla has several advantages. The company manages the entire process: it manufactures the EVs, develops the software, and runs the charging infrastructure. Additionally, it has a large fleet of vehicles already on the road that can be integrated into its robotaxi service. In contrast, Waymo's vehicles are significantly more expensive, with modifications necessary for self-driving estimated to cost as much as $100,000. This gives Tesla a considerable advantage. Tesla has now secured a ride-share license in Texas, paving the way for its autonomous robotaxi service to function under the state’s new self-driving laws alongside established competitors like Uber and Lyft. The ride-hailing market is already substantial. Uber managed over 230 million rides weekly in Q4 2024 alone. At approximately $30 per ride, this equates to a $375 billion annual revenue pool, and that’s just for human-driven rides. Autonomous rides could potentially yield even more – possibly reaching $750 billion annually. This represents a significant revenue opportunity for Tesla. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What is the reason for this? As a collective, the HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; a much more stable experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Tonight, tomorrow best times to see Perseid meteor shower
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2025/0812/1528037-perseid-meteor-shower/

The Perseid meteor shower will reach its peak tonight and tomorrow, making it the best time for stargazers to view the celestial fireworks. The event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swift-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every 133 years. The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earth's atmosphere at 36 miles per second, to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky. Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from 1,648C to 5,537C as they hit the atmosphere. The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus. Speaking on RTÉ's Morning Ireland, Resident Astronomer at Blackrock Observatory in Cork Danielle Wilcox said the best time to view the spectacle is after sunset and before the moon rise as it will be the darkest time. Ms Wilcox said there are around 12 meteor showers every year but Perseid has the most and brightest meteors. "These are very predictable, they happen every year at the same time," she said. "What is happening is we have comets that come from the outer solar system and they come in from the sun and they come near the sun and start to break up. "So you have all this debris that comes from the comet, so you will have ice, rock and different things that are coming from the comet. "And it leaves this cloud and it is in the same spot in space, so as we are going around the sun, Earth slams into this cloud and passes through all this debris in August every year," Ms Wilcox said. She said if anyone misses meteor shower tonight or tomorrow, not to worry as it continues for the next week. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: OpenAI and SpaceX are making it big without an IPO. That's bad news for young investors.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-investors-generation-defining-moment-private-markets-openai-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-12T08:15:02Z
Full Content:
Ed Elson, a 26-year-old research analyst and co-host of the Prof G Markets podcast, has heard plenty of stories about generations before him getting rich on stocks. His own co-host, New York University business school professor and entrepreneur Scott Galloway, who's 60, invested $800,000 in both Apple and Amazon back in 2009. Today, those investments total $40 million, a cornerstone of his $150 million net worth. Elson wants the same opportunity to invest in the tech companies defining his generation. He sees those chances in OpenAI and SpaceX, standout innovators that have soared to valuations of $300 billion or more. The problem? Both companies are private. OpenAI and SpaceX top a growing class of companies making it big without the public markets. Rather than expose themselves to public market scrutiny and quarterly earnings pressures, these companies are raising round after round of fresh funds from venture capital firms. Over the last 10 years, global startup funding has more than tripled, with VC investments projected to hit $400 billion this year, according to data from PitchBook. "The people who have access to the highest quality companies that are creating the most amount of value, i.e., OpenAI and SpaceX, are the people in VC who are already rich," Elson said. "That's a big problem for our generation." Seduced by fabulous success stories like Galloway's, and empowered by the proliferation of digital trading platforms plus the investing advice on platforms like TikTok, Zoomers have become a generation of investors. The average Gen Z investor starts trading at 19 years old, compared to baby boomers' typical kickoff at 35 years old. But there's also a gnawing sense that Gen Z missed out on the boom times. And they're not entirely wrong. The public markets now offer fewer stocks to choose from and higher price tags. Companies are waiting 14 years on average to go public, Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida's Warrington School of Business, has found. More private companies are valued in the tens and even hundreds of billions, a feat usually reserved for public companies. In 2025, an IPO is less a promise of what's to come for a company and more a signal that you've already missed out on its biggest gains. That shift has more investors setting their sights on secondary markets, where stock purchases of private companies are limited to traders accredited by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. And whereas the public markets are open to anyone with a brokerage account, just 13% of Americans qualify for that accreditation. "It almost feels like a private members-only club," says Vivian Tu, the 31-year-old personal finance educator behind 'Your Rich BFF.' "If you're already rich, you can invest in this stuff, and if you're not, sucks to suck. You're locked out of the club." Those rules aren't sitting well with Gen Z investors. Warren Buffett famously advised traders to invest in what they know. That's what Galloway did back in 2009 when he bought shares in Apple. The iPhone was still relatively new, but it was clear the technology was a game changer. He could get in relatively early and profit from the stock's exponential rise as Apple built on the momentum of its spectacular innovation. These days, some of the most exciting tech companies innovate without needing to IPO. Elson points to OpenAI's release of ChatGPT in 2022, which drew 1 million users in 5 days. "If we were living in the 1980s, there's a very, very high likelihood that OpenAI would've been public at that point," Elson says. Investors would have said: "Oh my God, this is an incredible tool. I want to buy some stock." But most investors were frozen out. In March, OpenAI was valued at $300 billion — a 900% spike in two years. The major beneficiaries included Microsoft, VC megafirm Sequoia Capital, and tech billionaire Peter Thiel. The critique that the public markets don't create enough value for mom and pop investors is virtually as old as public markets themselves. But the markets hit an inflection point in 2021 when a record 1,035 IPOs, raising a staggering $286 billion, were followed by an abrupt collapse. Investors, desperate for liquidity, began turning more to secondary markets to sell portions of their stakes. If companies can raise plenty of capital while keeping their investors happy, that has increasingly allowed them to put off their IPOs indefinitely. "It's pretty simple: Why go public if you have access to all the benefits while staying private?" says Deedy Das, a principal at Menlo Ventures. Das sums up the thinking of top-dollar startups this way: "I have all this administrative burden off my shoulders; I don't have to have that predictable revenue; I can take riskier bets; I don't have to explain to retail investors what my vision is. I can just run my business." With so much pent-up demand, it's been extraordinarily expensive for retail investors to get in when a hot company finally goes public. Take Figma, the design software maker, and its recent red-hot IPO. When it debuted in July, Figma's stock opened at $85 a share, more than double its $33-a-share IPO price. Since the overwhelming majority of IPO shares were allocated to institutional investors and not retail investors — which is typical for public listings — most retail investors paid a significant premium. At the end of the day, the frenzy had sent Figma's valuation soaring to more than 60 times its revenue in the biggest first-day jump for a multibillion-dollar tech company in decades. By the first week of August, however, Figma had shed billions of dollars in market value as the stock came back down to earth, leaving many of those same retail investors holding the bag. As of August 11, Figma's stock was valued less than its opening day price, meaning any retail investor who backed the company on its first day of trading has since lost money. Institutions that bought in at the IPO price, on the other hand, are holding stock that's still worth more than double what they paid for it. Of course, there are still plenty of public companies creating massive wealth for shareholders. Palantir's stock has surged over 1,800% since it began trading in 2020. Circle's shares have jumped 140% above their opening price in the crypto company's June IPO, though the stock has fluctuated wildly in that period. The public markets are still broadly considered the best place for companies to get returns to their employees and investors, since their liquid nature allows shareholders to cash out anytime. But the biggest stock gains will always be reserved for the savvy investor who spots a big opportunity early. And increasingly, these opportunities are not in the public markets. Lots of investors — including Zoomers like Elson — want in on the action happening on secondary markets. "Because of this dynamic where great companies have no incentive to go public, giving access to retail is heavily in our generation's financial interest," Elson said. While this might present bigger opportunities, it also carries significant risks. It's galling to retail investors that there's so much private company stock floating around — but they can't get to it. Getting your hands on private stocks generally means buying them from early investors that hold large chunks of equity or from early employees, who got stock as part of their compensation agreements. These so-called secondary sales generally must be approved by, if not facilitated by, the startup itself. And not a lot of companies, OpenAI included, are inclined to allow their employees or investors to sell shares on secondary platforms. In an attempt to democratize access to private company equity, platforms like EquityZen, Forge Global and Hiive, which broker secondary investments into pre-IPO companies, are picking up steam. UBS projects the secondary market will hit a record-breaking $180 billion this year, up from $156 billion in secondary transactions in 2024. EquityZen, which launched in 2013, says its user base has doubled in the past year; more than 770,000 individual investors and institutions are now registered on the marketplace. The company says it has brokered secondary sales for companies like Circle and Omada Health before their IPOs, as well as other startups that still haven't gone public, like Impossible Foods. The company wouldn't comment on whether it's facilitated any deals with OpenAI or SpaceX. These deals tend to be costlier than regular trading. Most secondary market platforms charge fees, often 5% of the sale, and require investors to put up anywhere from $5,000 to $100,000 or more to participate. The bigger catch is that not just anyone can access these platforms. On most major secondary platforms, investors must meet the SEC's stringent bar for accreditation: a net worth of over $1 million, excluding their primary residence, or a salary of at least $200,000 for the past two years and the expectation of earning that same income again. The SEC says the rule was set up to protect retail investors, who tend to underperform the broader market with their stock picks. These investors are generally advised to back index funds over individual stocks to minimize the chance of catastrophic losses. The private markets are even more risky since, without disclosure requirements, private deals can obscure key details about a startup's operations and pricing. But the requirement has been criticized by some as paternalistic, particularly amid surging activity on the private markets. After all, Americans can engage in plenty of high-risk activities with their money, from gambling to cryptocurrency investing to prediction market betting, with little to no regulation. "In a world in which anyone can invest in any meme coin they want, how reasonable is it that you're not allowed to invest in startups?" said Peter Walker, head of insights at Carta, a software platform that helps private companies manage their cap tables. In June, the US House of Representatives passed the Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act, which would allow investors who passed a financial literacy test to qualify for accreditation, paving the way for them to make private market bets. The Senate isn't yet scheduled to review the bill, however, and President Donald Trump has not said if he would support it. In a burgeoning market with minimal oversight, the stakes are high. Linqto, once a prominent marketplace for pre-IPO shares, declared bankruptcy in July. The SEC is currently investigating claims that the platform sold securities to non-accredited investors and charged its users excessive margins. The company told BI it had also discovered "serious defects" in the business "that raise questions about what customers actually own." It's unclear whether the thousands of investors who locked their cash away in Linqto will ever see that money again. Linqto said it's working with an unsecured creditors committee in its bankruptcy proceedings to develop a plan to reorganize the company and "maximize value for customers." As for getting a piece of OpenAI or SpaceX, a few financial firms are creating workarounds. In one example, exchange-traded funds like the ERShares Private-Public Crossover ETF can buy stakes in top private companies, and retail traders can buy those ETFs on the public markets. In December, the fund announced that SpaceX had become its top holding. But without regular public disclosures of SpaceX's finances, investors can only guess at the company's real-time value. In Europe, where SEC regulations don't apply, the stock trading app Robinhood has sold blockchain "tokens" of OpenAI and SpaceX stock. The tokens attempt to mirror the price of stocks without actually giving retail traders any stake in the company. Last month, OpenAI posted a statement on X saying the company had not partnered with Robinhood and that the tokens "are not OpenAI equity." Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev explained the app's approach in an interview with Bloomberg last month. "One of the biggest opportunities and also a big tragedy is that private markets are where the bulk of the interesting appreciation and exposure is nowadays," he said. "It's a shame that it's so difficult to get exposure in the US. We're obviously working to solve that." Matt Kennedy, a senior strategist at the IPO-focused firm Renaissance Capital, says it's perfectly understandable that the market's slowdown may be frustrating to new investors. Back in 2021, new subscribers to the firm's newsletter asked one question more than any other: How can I invest in pre-IPO companies? "There's this sense that, at the IPO, it's already too late. They want to get in on the ground floor," Kennedy said. But the firm advises investors to "be careful what you wish for." "Yes, you're not going to get that $20-million-in-annual-sales, fast-growing tech company that could be a behemoth," Kennedy said. "But you're also not going to get those less established companies without a solid track record. There's more margin of safety with a company that has $100 million or more in revenue." Barry Ritholtz, the founder of Ritholtz Wealth Management, echoed that sentiment. "A private company like OpenAI comes along, and suddenly people are salivating and getting FOMO and saying, I could pick the next one," Ritholtz said. "History tells us, the odds are you cannot." Many young investors see those risks as worth taking — if not for the potential financial upside, then for the crash course in market literacy. Juliette Richert, a senior associate at The Artemis Fund, has made three angel investments since joining the fund three years ago. Richert, who's now 26, says she hasn't seen any returns yet. Even if she never does, she thinks those bets were valuable opportunities for her early investment learnings. "Can I burn the money for the sake of learning something rather than anticipating any specific return?" she said. "For early investors like myself, I think that's a really healthy way to go about it." It's the Gen Z way. Rather than follow well-trodden paths of previous generations, Gen Z investors are determined to pounce on opportunities where they find them and seize their financial destinies. "There's this desire for control and autonomy, the 'American dynamism' mindset: make your own way, versus depending on the system," Richert said. Throw in prediction markets, fractional real estate, and collectibles from sports cards to sneakers, and it's clear that Gen Z isn't just investing differently — they're redefining what "investing" even means. "Young people are smart," Galloway said in conversation with Elson on a recent episode of their podcast. "They said, you know what, fuck this. I can't buy a home. Stocks are crazy expensive. So what am I going to do? I'm going to create my own asset classes. And I'm going to create my own volatility."

Share this article US-listed spot Ethereum ETFs listed in the US pulled in more than $1 billion in net inflows on Monday, their highest daily total since debut, according to data tracked by Farside Investors. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) and Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) also posted their largest single-day inflows, drawing about $640 million and $277 million, respectively. Except for Invesco’s fund, all other Ether ETFs posted positive results. BlackRock has maintained its top position, with assets under management exceeding $13 billion as of August 11. Monday’s gains pushed Ethereum funds into a five-day winning streak. Their longest winning streak on record took place between July 3 and July 31. The strong performance came as ETH hovered around $4,300, its highest level since December 2021. The digital asset is now around 12% away from its all-time high of $4,868 set in November 2021 during the bull run market, TradingView data shows. Ethereum’s price surge comes amid aggressive accumulations from publicly traded companies, such as Tom Lee’s BitMine and SharpLink Gaming. Furthermore, on Monday, Fundamental Global, soon to be renamed FG Nexus, which recently filed a $5 billion shelf registration with the SEC to expand its Ethereum accumulation strategy, announced it had acquired 47,331 ETH as part of its ambition to take a 10% stake in the network.

Title: China and the U.S. clash at the U.N. over the Panama Canal

By The Associated Press A cargo ship navigates through the Panama Canal, seen from the Cerro Ancon in Panama City. Matias Delacroix/AP hide caption UNITED NATIONS — The United States and China clashed over the Panama Canal at the United Nations on Monday, with the U.S. warning that Beijing's influence over the key waterway could threaten global trade and security and China calling U.S. accusations a pretext to take over the canal. The clash took place at a U.N. Security Council meeting where Panama's President José Raúl Mulino stressed the neutrality of the canal and his country's ownership of the waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Panama holds the council presidency this month, and Mulino was chairing a meeting on challenges to maritime security. Interpol Secretary General Valdecy Urquiza told members these include piracy, armed robbery, transnational crime and cyber criminals weaponizing artificial intelligence to attack ports where there is "minimal cyber security, maximum exposure." U.S. President Donald Trump thrust Panama into the spotlight even before winning election last November by suggesting that his country should consider retaking control of the Panama Canal and accusing Panama of ceding influence to China. The U.S. built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Control of the waterway transferred to Panama in 1999 under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. China's U.N. Ambassador Fu Cong emphasized to the council that "Panama has consistently and effectively managed the canal, making significant contributions to global shipping and trade." "China has always respected the permanent neutrality of the canal and firmly supports Panama in safeguarding its sovereignty over the canal to ensure its openness and smooth operation," he said. Acting U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea, who spoke afterward, went after China, expressing concern about its "outsized influence over the Panama Canal area, especially over critical infrastructure and port operations." Alluding to its claims in the South China Sea, she said, "China's expansive and unlawful maritime claims and aggressive actions demonstrate its threat to maritime security and commerce." She said the U.S. rejects these claims and supports countries opposing them. "China's influence in the canal area is not just a risk to Panama and the United States, but rather a potential threat to global trade and security," Shea said. The Trump administration has pressured China to have the Hong Kong-based operator of ports at either end of the canal sell those interests to a U.S. consortium that includes BlackRock Inc. Panama has vehemently rejected a takeover of the canal, but in April, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited Panama and agreed with Mulino to step up security coordination. The agreement also gives U.S. troops access to strategic air and naval facilities in the Central American nation, which sparked large protests in Panama's capital. China's Fu asked for the floor to respond to Shea's accusations after all council members spoke, this time lashing out at the Trump administration. "The United States' fabrication of lies and groundless attacks against China are nothing but a pretext for seeking control of the canal," he said. The Chinese envoy called the U.S. and its deployment of offensive weapons in the South China Sea area "the biggest disrupter of peace and stability" in the region, and he accused the administration of exacerbating risks to global maritime security. "China firmly opposes economic coercion and bullying practices and urges the United States to stop fabricating rumors, lies and creating trouble," Fu said. Murillo then responded, saying he wanted to stress Panama's sovereignty "in terms of the ownership of the canal" and the multilateral treaty governing its administration. He called the canal's neutrality "the only and the best defense" to any specific or global threats. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: Price And Promo; Reddit Ditches The Wayback Machine

Beverage brand AriZona Iced Tea requires essentially zero advertising. A can has cost 99 cents for 30 years. Price and promotions are intrinsically related.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Can The Trade Desk turn walled gardens’ retreat into open web gains?

Hear from execs at The New York Times, Thomson Reuters, Trusted Media Brands and many others This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → If you’re reading this, you’ll likely have seen at least some of the latest financial results posted by the ad tech sector’s coterie of publicly listed companies, with AppLovin and The Trade Desk leading the pack in earnings (see below). Both companies, talismans of independent ad tech, saw their stock prices dip in early hours after issuing Q2 earnings — despite reporting a 77% and 19% annual increase in revenues, respectively.In The Trade Desk’s case, this included an immediate 30% plunge. The declines were tied to “the narrative,” with analysts deeming guidance remarks underwhelming. AppLovin retained its lead as top earner, with The Trade Desk, now in the S&P 500, nearing $700 million in revenue for the period. Indies eye gains from Google’s troubles and walled garden retreat A common thread across several earnings was the potential to benefit from Google’s mounting legal troubles with the Justice Department. The week began with news that OpenX is seeking compensation for Google’s anticompetitive actions as part of an ongoing ad tech antitrust case. Meanwhile, Magnite leadership expressed similar concerns during their Q2 earnings call (see above). In a Q&A after The Trade Desk’s August 7 earnings call, CEO Jeff Green said these trials are creating opportunity for independent ad tech as marketers grow wary of Google and other Big Tech platforms. Green noted “the supply-side demand imbalance” favoring “the open internet” over walled gardens like Amazon, Google, and Meta. “Consumers spend more of their time in the premium open internet than they do inside of walled gardens,” he said, adding that walled gardens have an inherent conflict of interest. “I believe TTD and the open internet have a bigger TAM than Facebook has… Our goal is to buy the entire open Internet objectively for buyers.” He also claimed, “As Google and Facebook have largely abandoned the open internet, The Trade Desk is the largest source of third-party demand for many publishers around the world.” Profit trumps transparency in adland and finance While investors punished perceived weak growth forecasts, they appeared forgiving of structural flaws in the ecosystem. Several high-profile criticisms of the cohort barely registered in analyst questioning across calls. The last 12 months have been turbulent for the sector, with short-sellers targeting multiple companies, including AppLovin and Zeta Global, causing stock price volatility. Yet Q2 results suggest advertisers largely ignored these claims. In Q1, AppLovin’s stock fell 20% after Muddy Waters alleged unethical data use, prompting a rare off-calendar defense from leadership. In Q2 disclosures, executives emphasized plans to drive advertiser growth via AI and greater adoption of its self-serve platform, reducing reliance on sales or product teams. It also aims to expand internationally so its customer base is evenly split between the U.S. and global markets. With a Q4 rollout, AppLovin is targeting SMBs, expanding beyond in-app into broader web and e-commerce. CEO Adam Foroughi said testing has brought in hundreds of advertisers, “The new type of platform that comes to our platform is extremely incremental to our business… We expect that will increase the advertiser count quite quickly, and also allow us to go through live examples of advertisers coming in self-service [and then] all the way to scale on our product.” Despite revenues of $1.2 billion, up 77% year-over-year and beating expectations, AppLovin’s stock still fell 7% after the announcement — a sign of investors’ counterintuitive moves. Earlier in the week, Zeta Global, which faced short-seller reports late last year, posted similarly strong results. Earnings rose 35% year-over-year to exceed $300 million, signaling client confidence despite prior allegations. Analysts focused more on Zeta’s competitive positioning, particularly with agencies under pressure to develop high-margin software tools. Also under scrutiny in 2025 have been ad measurement and brand safety giants DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science. Both reported Q2 growth: DoubleVerify at $198 million, up 21% year-over-year, and IAS at $149.2 million, up 16%. These gains came despite reports highlighting brand safety shortcomings. In March, Adalytics alleged DoubleVerify and IAS failed to block ads to declared bots despite advertisers paying for pre-bid bot filtration, and routinely allowed general invalid traffic, implying advertisers were misled about protection levels. This followed an earlier report claiming both allowed ads on sites with child abuse content, triggering a class-action suit against DoubleVerify. The company has responded with its own defamation case against Adalytics. Despite the controversy, revenue momentum and advertiser contracts appear to be sustaining both companies. On DoubleVerify’s August 5 call, leadership highlighted rising activity in social and CTV — up 14% and 45% annually, respectively — while fielding questions about relevance as the open web wanes. CEO Mark Zargorski, discussing AI’s rise, said, “So many of the AI solutions don’t include a lot of transparency on what’s going on… That’s part of our role, to drive transparency and open up that black box a bit.” He added that value remains strong among customers on Meta and other platforms using AI tools “without a lot of transparency or clarity on how we’re getting there.” LiveRamp also posted results for the quarter ending June 30 — “Q1 2026” in its reporting. Revenue rose 11% year-over-year to $195 million. Guidance for the next quarter was $197 million, with a full-year forecast of up to $818 million. “Google went from organizing the world’s information to stealing it, taking a sledgehammer to the implied contract the open web has relied on for so long.” –Odysseas Papadimitriou, WalletHub CEO, in a blog post explaining how his company has removed 40,000 pages of its financial content from the reach of Google and other AI search engines. Instead, this content will now be exclusively available to logged-in WalletHub users. Future of TV Briefing: 5 reasons CTV’s ROI comes up short for advertisers Despite the hype, CTV is still not the miracle media channel for advertisers. The reason? It’s still impossible to justify the costs, according to UM Worldwide chief investment officer Marcy Greenberger. ‘You can nullify the effects of what looks like change’: OpenX CEO John Gentry on its legal quarrel with Google After filing legal papers citing Google’s alleged misdeeds to subvert and dominate the online display ad ecosystem, notably in the Eastern District of Virginia, the same jurisdiction where the biggest company in advertising is doing battle with the Justice Department, seeking damages, and adding to calls for a structural remedy. Omnicom’s Samardzija To Join Stagwell In The Fall After Digiday first covered news of a pending leadership shakeup at Omnicom Media Group, with the pending exit of Annalect CEO Slavi Samardzija, it has subsequently been announced that he will join independent media agency Stagwell, with precise details of his role yet to be confirmed. The State of Digital, 2025, by LUMA Partners The macroeconomic environment improved throughout 2024, but uncertainty over the tariff policies to be enacted by the current U.S. administration caused market instability. Despite this, digital ad spend has rebounded, and AI is now considered a fundamental requirement for marketers, with the amount of mergers and acquisitions in the space experiencing a notable uptick in the opening quarter of 2025. More Like No Yield: A New Book Explores How Google Soaked Up The Web’s Ad Profits AdExchanger’s James Hercher sums up Ari Paparo’s book, “Yield: how Google bought, built and bullied its way to advertising dominance.” It features a host of familiar names such as Stephanie Layser, Jana Meron, Brian O’Kelley, Michael Barrett, Michael Rubenstein and many other industry leaders play prominent roles, all of whom help chronicle how Google ingested DoubleClick, and later went on to cross almost every tier of the market with a series of rollouts such as Project Poirot, Project Bell, Project Bernanke, Project Jedi Blue, Project Liberty, Project Wolf and Project Centillion. This Ad Tech OG’s AI-Powered Analytics Startup Just Raised $9M In Series A Funding Newton Research, a company led by ex-Data Plus Math exec John Hoctor has raised $9 million two years after it was founded, taking its total funding to $14 million. Contributors to the latest Series A round include Greycroft and Bessemer Partners, along with S4S Ventures, Aperiam Ventures, plus LiveRamp’s investment arm. Fortunes are fluctuating, despite earnings increases across the board… time for consolidation? The adoption of AI tools like agentic offerings and smarts in new hires to power more of media agency workings continues to pick up pace. The Amazon threat to The Trade Desk is inevitable — just not immediate.

Title: All-Time High For Crypto Market: Ethereum Leads The Charge Above $4,000

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. On Monday, the total crypto market capitalization (TOTAL) reached an all-time high (ATH) of $4.03 trillion, driven by significant gains in leading cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), reflecting renewed optimism in the crypto space fueled by favorable regulatory developments from the US. Ethereum notably broke through the $4,000 barrier for the first time in almost nine months, closing the gap to its all-time high of $4,878, now just 13% away. This upward momentum has been attributed to growing interest in cryptocurrencies, bolstered by pro-crypto regulatory measures that have enhanced market sentiment. Notably, the US has spearheaded a new wave of pro-crypto regulations, sparking a surge in investment in the digital asset market with the passage and signing of the first crypto bill, the GENIUS Act. This new legislation aims to create a more favorable regulatory framework for stablecoins, which are dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. Ethereum plays a key role in the stablecoin market, as a large portion of stablecoin activity occurs on its blockchain. In contrast, Bitcoin approached its current record high of $123,000 earlier in the day but ultimately fell short of the critical $120,000 mark, which is seen as essential for entering a new price discovery phase. Despite this, the overall market sentiment remains buoyant, particularly in light of recent executive orders from President Donald Trump aimed at fostering a more favorable environment for digital assets. On Thursday, Trump issued directives calling for a reevaluation of federal guidance on integrating cryptocurrencies into employer-sponsored retirement plans like 401(k)s. Analysts view this shift as a potential boom for the crypto industry, especially considering that 401(k) assets totaled $8.7 trillion in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Investment Company Institute. As such, Ethereum has outperformed many of its peers among the top ten cryptocurrencies, posting gains of just over 13% in the past week. The only token to surpass this growth has been Cronos (CRO), which saw an 18% rally during the same period. Crypto analyst Doctor Profit has weighed in on Ethereum’s performance, suggesting that breaking the $4,000 barrier signals a massive breakout from an ascending triangle pattern on the monthly chart. This pattern is considered bullish, indicating that Ethereum could continue its upward trajectory in the coming months. In a recent analysis shared on X (formerly Twitter), Doctor Profit projected that Ethereum might reach new heights, potentially hitting $8,000. If this forecast holds true, it would represent an impressive 88% increase from ETH’s current trading price of $4,250 as of late Monday.

Title: How safe is your sunscreen and how long does it last after opening?

Consumer concerns have been raised about the protection offered by sunscreens after some well known brands were found in independent studies to contain less SPF (sun protection factor) than they indicated on the label. The consumer groups Choice and Which? sent a variety of popular sunscreen brands to be tested in accredited independent laboratories to see if they met their stated SPF claims. The brands Ultra Violette and Ultrasun were found to offer much lower levels of SPF than their labels indicated. Choice found that Ultra Violette’s Lean Screen SPF50+ Mattifying Zinc Skinscreen, which retails for €39 at Space NK, returned a SPF rating of just 4 when tested. Separately, Which? revealed that the Ultrasun Family SPF30 lotion, which retails for €35 at Boots, did not meet the minimum required UVA level in their tests. Both Ultra Violette and Ultrasun strongly disputed the claims citing their own testing protocols as superior to those employed in Choice and Which?’s research. Lidl and Aldi’s own-brand products were Which?’s best value sunscreens. Aldi’s Lacura SPF50+ Sensitive Lotion and Lidl’s Cien Sun Spray SPF30, which both retail for €3.99, passed key sun safety tests and were significantly cheaper than their big brand rivals. However, Choice found that another Aldi own-brand sunscreen, Ombra Everyday Sunscreen Lotion 50+, which is not available in Ireland but is sold abroad, returned an SPF rating of just 26. We put Choice and Which?’s findings to three consultant dermatologists, each of whom say they would not be concerned by the results. “Sunscreen testing is technically complex and highly sensitive to variations in methodology,” says Prof Caitríona Ryan, consultant dermatologist at the Institute of Dermatologists and Blackrock Clinic. “In the case of the recent Choice report, several products were tested using a small sample size, which is well below the standard required for international SPF testing. Ultra Violette have since provided retesting data from accredited labs showing that their products do meet or exceed SPF 50+ claims under proper conditions.” Prof Anne-Marie Tobin, consultant dermatologist and professor of clinical medicine at Trinity College Dublin, is more concerned by lack of awareness around the exposure risks of applying expired sunscreen. “You should not use any old sun cream out of your bathroom cabinet, as it may have expired. Expired sun cream will not give you protection against UVA or UVB rays, as the active ingredient in the sun cream will have degraded,” Prof Tobin says. “You can check if your sun cream has expired by looking for a small drawing of a jar with a lid that has a number inside it, which is on every bottle of sun cream. The number tells you how many months you can use your sun cream for after you have opened it.” Prof Ryan adds that while UVB rays are primarily responsible for sunburn and direct DNA damage, UVA rays penetrate deeper into the skin, accelerating photo-ageing and increasing the long-term risk of skin cancer. “Unlike UVB, UVA levels remain constant throughout the year and can penetrate through cloud and glass. This is why choosing a sun cream that offers broad-spectrum protection, which shields against both UVA and UVB, is essential, even on cloudy days or when indoors near windows and particularly when driving,” Prof Ryan says. When it comes to the difference in protection between SPF30 and SPF50, Prof Ryan explains: “The SPF is a time-based measure, it indicates how much longer someone can stay in the sun without burning, compared to wearing no sunscreen. If you would normally burn after 10 minutes of sun exposure, an SPF30 theoretically allows you to stay protected for 300 minutes, while SPF50 would extend that to 500 minutes. SPF30 filters out around 97 per cent of UVB rays, and SPF50 filters about 98 per cent.” Prof Tobin and London-based consultant dermatologist Dr Aamna Adel agree that more people than ever are practising sun safety whether that is because people have aesthetic concerns around skin ageing or they are worried about developing skin cancer. Prof Tobin notes that while patients are very good at applying protection to their faces, they are not as good at protecting their chest, shoulders, neck and back. All three experts agreed that most skin cancers arise from cumulative UV exposure. “You can get skin cancer from being continuously exposed to low levels of UV over many years, rather than a one-off burn. It is best to turn putting on sun cream into an everyday habit like brushing your teeth. However, sun cream is only as effective as the person who applies it and most people don’t apply enough sun cream or don’t reapply their sun cream as frequently as they should,” Dr Adel says. [ Sunscreen: All you need to know to pick the best SPF for your face, scalp and bodyOpens in new window ] Prof Ryan also points to an alarming trend among younger people, using UV index data, not to avoid harm, but to maximise tanning. “Some social media influencers now promote the idea of ‘safe tanning’ during peak UV hours, but UV radiation is a Group 1 carcinogen, and tanning, even without burning, still causes cumulative DNA damage that can lead to skin cancer. There is also a common misconception that sunscreen blocks all vitamin D production, but research shows that people produce adequate vitamin D while wearing SPF.” Prof Ryan has seen an increase in the number of younger adults being diagnosed with melanomas. “Particularly women in their 20s and 30s, which is likely linked to intermittent high-intensity UV exposure from tanning beds and sun holidays.” Prof Tobin advises that most sun protection should be provided by clothing, and staying out of the sun when the UV is strongest between 12pm and 3pm. Skin cancer is the most common cancer in Ireland, with more than 11,000 people diagnosed annually according to the Irish Cancer Society. The National Skin Cancer Registry Ireland expects the number of diagnoses to double by 2040. However, Prof Tobin believes the official diagnosis statistics are actually underestimated because statisticians must verify every case and so are “likely quite behind with the figures they publish”. There are two main categories of skin cancer: melanoma and non-melanoma. Dr Adel says that the symptoms of melanoma are “a mole that is in any way changing in size, colour, texture or even if it begins to itch”. While the symptoms of non-melanoma are: “a spot or scab that is oozing, crusting over or just not healing”. Prof Tobin wants there to be greater awareness around the symptoms of non-melanoma skin cancer as it is the most common form of skin cancer. “About 1,200 people are diagnosed with melanoma skin cancers every year, the rest are all non-melanoma.” Dr Adel frequently encounters people who delay getting checked because they worry that they will be wasting the doctor’s time. “I would much rather have people come to see me with something that does not turn out to need treatment than to wait longer and potentially put themselves at risk. Early detection gives patients the best chance of making a full recovery,” Dr Adel says. [ Six of the best budget sunscreens for summer 2025Opens in new window ] In response to Choice’s SPF protection findings Ultra Violette issued this statement: “Ultra Violette is deeply committed to the health and safety of our customers and only work with reputable, TGA licensed manufacturers who perform substantial quality release testing in accordance with the strictest SPF standards in the world. We do not accept these results as even remotely accurate.” Likewise, Ultrasun disputed Which?’s findings: “Ultrasun is fully confident in our testing protocols. Our chosen testing protocol is one of the strictest available, and our UVB and UVA filters are tested both in vitro and in vivo. We conclusively support the result of our independent tests which found that the Ultrasun Family SPF30 reached a UVB-SPF in vivo of 31.4 and a UVA-PF in vitro of 13.1, which equates to a 92 per cent UVA absorbance.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Trump says Nvidia's 15% duty applies to ‘old’ H20 chips, may permit export of up to 50% downgraded Blackwell chip

US President Donald Trump stated that the current duties over Nvidia's export deal with China only cover the older H20 chip, which he described as “essentially old." Speaking to the reporters on Monday (E.T.), Trump said he would consider a deal that would let Nvidia send its Blackwell chips to China if the company could make them less advanced. “It’s possible I’d make a deal” on a “somewhat enhanced — in a negative way — Blackwell” processor, he said.. “In other words, take 30% to 50% off of it.” Additionally, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is expected to visit this week to discuss the new chip, Blackwell. Earlier, Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) had agreed to give 15% of their Chinese AI chip sales revenues to the US government. This deal is meant to secure export licenses and is considered an unusual arrangement that could unsettle both US companies and Beijing, reported Bloomberg News. Trump mentioned he initially asked Nvidia for a 20% cut for the US if he approved H20 sales to China, but he ultimately agreed to a 15% share. The two negotiated “a little deal,” he said. Nvidia intends to allocate 15% of its revenue from H20 AI accelerator sales China, the report noted citing a person familiar with the matter, while AMD will pay the same share from MI308 revenues. The revenue-sharing agreement for Nvidia's H20 chip and the possibility of another one for Blackwell chip highlight Trump’s consistent effort to orchestrate a financial gain for America in exchange for trade concessions. Such unprecedented arrangements, however, risk setting a precedent for all American companies operating in the Asian nation and may undermine the US government’s justification for export controls, the report said, citing experts. Over the past week, Trump has criticised chipmakers with various statements that unsettled firms from Silicon Valley to Asia. On Wednesday, he threatened to impose 100% tariffs on imported chips unless companies invested more in the US. However, these new tariffs would likely affect very few companies, as most major chipmakers are already covered by existing investments or trade agreements.

Title: A US senator from Colombia emerges as a Trump link for Latin America's conservatives

Time Published: 2025-08-12T01:26:20Z
Full Content:
U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno has emerged as an interlocutor for conservatives in Latin America seeking to connect with the Trump administration MIAMI -- When Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno visits Colombia this week as part of a three-nation tour of Latin America, it will be something of a homecoming. Ohio’s first Latino senator, who defeated an incumbent last year with the help of Donald Trump’s endorsement, was born in the Colombian capital of Bogota, and even as he was chasing the American dream, he kept close tabs on the country through older brothers who are heavyweights in politics and business there. Moreno, 58, has emerged as an interlocutor for conservatives in Latin America seeking to connect with the Trump administration. In an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the trip, he expressed deep concern about Colombia’s direction under left-wing President Gustavo Petro and suggested that U.S. sanctions, higher tariffs or other retaliatory action might be needed to steer it straight. The recent criminal conviction of former President Alvaro Uribe, a conservative icon, was an attempt to “silence” the man who saved Colombia from guerrilla violence, Moreno said. Meanwhile, record cocaine production has left the United States less secure — and Colombia vulnerable to being decertified by the White House for failing to cooperate in the war on drugs. “The purpose of the trip is to understand all the dynamics before any decision is made,” said Moreno, who will meet with both Petro and Uribe, as well as business leaders and local officials. “But there’s nothing that’s taken off the table at this point and there’s nothing that’s directly being contemplated.” Moreno, a luxury car dealer from Cleveland, defeated incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown last year with the help of $441 million in political ad spending — the most in U.S. Senate race history. He became Ohio’s senior senator on practically his first day in office after his close friend JD Vance resigned the Senate to become vice president. In Congress, Moreno has mimicked Trump’s rhetoric to attack top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer as a “miserable old man out of a Dickens novel,” called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and threatened to subpoena California officials over their response to anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. On Latin America, he’s been similarly outspoken, slamming Petro on social media as a “socialist dictator” and accusing Mexico of being on the path to becoming a “narco state.” He also surprised many hardliners in the GOP early on by suggesting in January that Trump should engage with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro despite his re-election in what the U.S., European Union and other governments condemned as a rigged vote. While referring to Maduro as a “gang leader” and "terrorist," Moreno nonetheless expressed support for the Trump administration's decision last month to allow energy giant Chevron to resume drilling in Venezuela following a deal with Maduro to free 10 jailed Americans held there. “What people wanted to hear in January is that we’re going to fly F-16s into Caracas and wage war against the country and that just wasn’t going to happen,” said Moreno in the interview. “If we take actions that are too much in that direction, we end up turning Venezuela over to China.” Such comments barely register in blue-collar Ohio, but they’ve garnered attention in Latin America. That despite the fact Moreno hasn’t lived in the region for decades and doesn’t sit on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “He’s somebody to watch,” said Michael Shifter, the former president of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. “He’s one of the most loyal Trump supporters in the Senate, and, given his background in Latin America, he could be influential on policy.” Moreno starts his first congressional delegation to Latin America on Monday for two days of meetings in Mexico City with officials including President Claudia Sheinbaum. Moreno, in the pre-trip interview, said that Sheinbaum has done more to combat the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. than her predecessor and mentor Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who he described as a “total disaster.” But he said more cooperation is needed, and he’d like to see Mexico allow the DEA to participate in judicial wiretaps like it has for decades in Colombia and allow it to bring back a plane used in bilateral investigations that López Obrador grounded. “The corruption becomes so pervasive, that if it’s left unchecked, it’s kind of like treating cancer,” said Moreno. “Mexico has to just come to the realization that it does not have the resources to completely wipe out the drug cartels. And it’s only going to be by asking the U.S. for help that we can actually accomplish that.” From Mexico, Moreno heads to Panama, where he’ll tour the Panama Canal with Trump’s new ambassador to the country, Kevin Marino Cabrera. In March, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate struck a deal that would have handed control of two ports on either end of the U.S.-built canal to American investment firm BlackRock Inc. The deal was heralded by Trump, who had threatened to take back the canal to curb Chinese influence. However, the deal has since drawn scrutiny from antitrust authorities in Beijing and last month the seller said it was seeking to add a strategic partner from mainland China — reportedly state-owned shipping company Cosco — to the deal. “Cosco, you might as well say, is the actual communist party,” said Moreno. “There’s no scenario in which Cosco can be part of the Panamanian ports.” On the final leg of the tour in Colombia, Moreno will be joined by another Colombian American senator: Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona. In contrast to Moreno, who was born into privilege and counts among his siblings a former ambassador to the U.S., Gallego and his three sisters were raised by an immigrant single mother on a secretary’s paycheck. Despite their different upbringings, the two have made common cause in seeking to uphold the tradition of bilateral U.S. support for Colombia, for decades Washington’s staunchest ally in the region. It’s a task made harder by deepening polarization in both countries. The recent sentencing of Uribe to 12 years of house arrest in a long-running witness tampering case has jolted the nation’s politics with nine months to go before decisive presidential elections. The former president is barred from running but remains a powerful leader, and Moreno said his absence from the campaign trail could alter the playing field. He also worries that surging cocaine production could once again lead to a “narcotization” of a bilateral relationship that should be about trade, investment and mutual prosperity. “We want Colombia to be strong, we want Colombia to be healthy, we want Colombia to be prosperous and secure, and I think the people of Colombia want the exact same thing,” he added. “So, the question is, how do we get there?” ___ Smyth reported from Columbus, Ohio. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Utilisation steady at 86%; employee count flat QoQ. ~Management guided for 15%+ organic growth in FY26E, with EBITDA margin stabilising in the 16–17% range. ~We estimate 19.0%/19.8%/22.3% Revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR over FY25–27E. Valuing at 25x Q1FY28E PE, TP of Rs 320 implies 51% upside. Key risks: 1) Slowdown in any of the 4 key segments 2) Lower SMB spends in US & Europe. CMP: Rs 5,155 | TP: Rs 6,880 (UR) | Rating: Buy (UR) Revenue: Rs 3,520 mn (+6.8% YoY, -4.3% QoQ). EBITDA: Rs 592 mn (-4.7% YoY, -10% QoQ). EBITDA margin was at 16.8% vs 18.8% YoY and 17.9% QoQ mainly due to a 16% jump in SG&A expenses, primarily employee costs. PAT: Rs 409 mn (-7.9% YoY, -13.7% QoQ). PAT margin was at 11.6% vs 13.5% YoY and 12.9% in QoQ. Our view: ESAB India’s Q1-FY26 topline growth was soft but in-line with our estimates, though EBITDA and PAT growth was more disappointing coming in at 10-14% lower than our expectations. We will shortly review our TP and rating on the stock. 1. Record-Breaking Q1 FY26 Performance Sales: ₹235Cr, +39% YoY / +17% QoQ EBITDA: ₹47Cr, +38% YoY / +19% QoQ EBITDA Margins 20%, +41bps QoQ PAT: ₹34Cr, +53% YoY / +45% QoQ Cash and Cash equivalents: 280cr Strong history of dividend and buyback | 200cr distributed in last 5 years Key Drivers - Deeper client penetration and growing share of lab-grown diamond (LGD) jewellery - LGD jewellery commanding premium realisations over mined diamonds - Omnichannel strategy driving demand in US retail (clients include JCPenney, Sears, Walmart) - India’s emerging LGD jewellery market 2. LGD Leadership & Backward Integration LGD share of revenue: 88% in Q1 Acquisition of Eco Diamond LLP (EDL) enables: - In-house LGD production at competitive costs - Margin expansion through cost efficiencies Design-led approach → faster inventory turnover, reduced working capital needs 3. Strong Growth Visibility 72% of inventory already placed with customers — signalling healthy demand Retail Expansion Plan: - 100–125 ORIGEM stores in 24–36 months - Targeting leadership as India’s largest exclusive LGD jewellery chain 4. Attractive ORIGEM Unit Economics Capex-light model: ₹2–2.5 Cr inventory per store Rapid breakeven: Some stores achieve breakeven in Month 1 with ~₹20 Lakh monthly sales High gross margins: 42–45% vs 25–35% for funded peers Competitive pricing: 5–30% lower than competitors, yet higher margins — driven by backward integration and cost advantage Goldiam International combines record financial performance with structural tailwinds from the fast-growing LGD segment. -> Integrated supply chain -> Strong global & domestic retail presence -> Resilience in passing on tariffs -> High-margin ORIGEM retail model position it for sustained earnings growth and market leadership in the global LGD space Trades at 17x FY27E earnings | Undervalued vs growth potential in LGD retail CMP: INR 176 | TP: INR 295 | Rating: BUY ~ We retain BUY rating on Sequent and increased our TP to INR 295 (previously INR 275) due to roll-over to Q1FY28E. ~ Sequent delivered revenue of INR 4.4bn (+13% YoY, +10% QoQ) helped by rebound in the API segment, increased exports, new market growth and price hikes. EBITDA margin (pre-ESOP) stood at 13.6% (vs 12.4% LY). SSL continue to focus on high-value products and operational efficiencies. ~Viyash reported a soft revenue growth (3.7% YoY and -4.9% QoQ); EBITDA margin (Pre-ESOP) stood at 19.5% (vs 17.1% LY) driven by product mix optimization. R&D pipeline remains robust, with 16+ products in development, reinforcing future growth visibility. ~ The combined entity delivered Q1FY26 revenue of INR 7.9bn, (up 8.8% YoY and 2.8% QoQ), with EBITDA margins (Pre-ESOPs) expanding to 16.2% (vs. 14.6% LY). Margin momentum is expected to sustain and improve for both SSL and Viyash, supported by synergy realisation and the ramp-up of Viyash’s operations beyond 60-65% utilisation. ~ We expect the merger to unlock meaningful synergies, driving a revenue and EBITDA CAGR of 17.1% and 35%, respectively, over FY25-28E. The combined entity is well-positioned with enhanced operational efficiency and a strong balance sheet, supporting margin expansion and improved return profiles.

This is a testament to sustained investor confidence and disciplined participation. Equity mutual funds recorded their highest-ever monthly inflow of ₹42,702 crore, with DIIs maintaining strong support. SIP contributions hit a new record of ₹28,464 crore, and contributing accounts grew 5.4% to 9.11 crore - clear evidence of disciplined investing even amid volatility. AMFI remains committed to investor education and fostering a transparent, well-regulated ecosystem that supports long-term wealth creation.” Hindalco’s subsidiary Novelis reports a weak Q1FY26 with EBITDA/tonne at $432, below the expected $445–450, due to high scrap prices, a weaker product mix, and a $28 million tariff hit ($60 million expected in Q2). Management believes EBITDA has bottomed out, with tariff mitigation and a $100 million+ cost-cutting program set to improve 2HFY26 performance. Net debt rose 8% QoQ to $5.29 billion, a 19-quarter high, driven by Bay Minette plant investments, with leverage at 3.2x. Despite near-term pressures, strong beverage packaging demand and cost reductions support long-term growth, though rising debt and tariffs remain risks. Hindalco’s stock was stable at ₹672.85–676.

Title: Stripe Is Building A Blockchain: Can Openness Survive Branded Rails?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/christiancatalini/2025/08/11/stripe-is-building-a-blockchain-can-openness-survive-branded-rails/
Time Published: 2025-08-12T00:20:00Z
Full Content:
ByChristian Catalini ByChristian Catalini, Contributor. Fintech powerhouse Stripe is secretly building a high-performance blockchain called “Tempo,” per a now-removed job posting and Fortune’s reporting. This payments-optimized chain would fill a critical gap in Stripe’s crypto stack, complementing its recent acquisitions of stablecoin startup Bridge and wallet infrastructure provider Privy. Stablecoins promise to make crypto mainstream by delivering faster, cheaper, more interconnected global payments. The paradox: the same move could undercut what the technology set out to achieve. Add the rush to branded rails—Robinhood’s chain on Arbitrum, Coinbase’s Base on the OP Stack, and now Stripe’s Tempo—and we could end up close to where we started, just with block explorers. Worse, market concentration may rise if a few players use stablecoins to reach previously unimaginable scale. With the GENIUS Act now law, the next 12–18 months will likely determine the outcome. We’ve seen this tension before in the early internet’s open web versus walled gardens. In the history of technology, the pendulum regularly swings between centralization and decentralization. Even when a technology has a decentralizing effect, economies of scale in a new dimension—whether complementary resources, talent, brand, or distribution—inevitably become vectors of concentration. Once concentration becomes too high, the ingenuity of entrepreneurs and developers invents a new approach to reverse it. A prominent example is the early internet, which brought a wave of entry and competition to the heavily concentrated industries of telecommunications, retail, and media—only to create the perfect conditions for today’s tech giants to scale through network effects and capture a sizable share of value. Although the underlying internet protocols remained open and neutral, massive digital platforms at the application layer walled off participants from competing services by strategically breaking interoperability. From email to social media to payments, we spend most of our time and money within the confines of what the tech giants have designed for us. And while we are clearly better off—more choice, lower prices—it’s increasingly clear that some would prefer a world where platforms do not have as much power and influence over them. Crypto’s reason for existence was to break free from centralized intermediaries. After the 2008 financial crisis, Satoshi wanted to create a world where anyone could exchange value without having to trust a central bank or financial institution ever again. And while the original Bitcoin vision of a fully democratic network—“one‑CPU‑one‑vote”—didn’t pan out due to economies of scale in mining, Bitcoin did deliver what more and more financial institutions and some governments now recognize as a novel and neutral financial asset. Inspired by Bitcoin, entrepreneurs and developers have applied the same principles in an attempt to bring decentralization back to other digital platforms—starting with payments, but branching out into finance, marketplaces, messaging, and social media. Overall, progress toward decentralization is mixed: while it’s true that Bitcoin allows anyone around the world to be their own bank, the vast majority of consumers and institutions rely heavily on intermediaries for custody and use. Similarly, solutions that offer consumers greater control over their private data and the content they create have stayed niche—often because they lag in usability and convenience relative to the centralized counterparts they’re trying to replace. Convenience eats privacy for lunch any day—and it’s difficult to undo the entrenched network effects of the leading digital platforms. In payments, the most critical battle is unfolding now. Legacy infrastructure is siloed, and incumbents have tremendous power over what we can access—and on what terms. Because of winner‑take‑all dynamics, markets can become so concentrated that the public sector has to step in—the most salient example is China’s introduction of a central bank digital currency to unravel the payments oligopoly established by Ant Group and Tencent. Crypto is a natural, market‑driven solution to this. It provides neutral and decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether, as well as truly open and interoperable financial rails via their base layers. But as the technology has matured, two core problems have emerged. The first problem is that cryptocurrencies are volatile and therefore expensive for payments and financial contracts. To address this, the market has focused on fiat‑backed stablecoins; this inevitably leads to centralization because issuance and sound management require a regulated financial entity to be in charge of—and accountable for—reserve operations. While distributed governance of a stablecoin network is technically possible, it is extremely difficult to get the design right. Libra is the most prominent example: despite backing from more than two dozen leading global companies and countless resources dedicated to establishing credible distributed governance, the project was always perceived as Meta’s initiative. Banks have tried for more than a decade to come together as consortia in response to crypto, and, to date, no joint project has delivered anything tangible. The reason is obvious: until the situation is truly dire, competitors are unlikely to commit to a joint solution—so, in the meantime, everyone hedges their bets across multiple tracks. Intuitively, distributed ownership of a stablecoin network makes sense and is not that different from what ultimately made Visa scale in the 1970s—when Bank of America relinquished control of the BankAmericard credit card program to respond to increasing competition from the consortium that would become Mastercard. Networks of crypto exchanges and fintechs, such as the Global Dollar Network, may be able to move faster, given the agility of the new entrants backing them, but they will still need to strike the right balance between economic incentives and governance to shift members from a wait‑and‑see mode—where everyone hopes to free‑ride on others’ efforts—into action. Even Circle’s Centre Consortium, which had only Circle and Coinbase as members, was dissolved and converted into a simple revenue‑sharing agreement. So, while there might be a solution to the decentralized governance of a stablecoin, what we know is that, to date, the only working model is one that places a single entity in charge of everything. This is, of course, problematic in the long term, and while issuers today control only the asset, they have already started expanding their offerings in ways that limit openness. For example, Circle announced its payment network (CPN), which places it at the center of how payments are executed—from defining rules and eligibility, to inserting itself into every API interaction and price and liquidity discovery, to, of course, collecting a fee. Put together, this setup is not that different from the model that has allowed Visa and Mastercard to dominate payments for decades. The second problem crypto has run into is one that is deeply tied to its roots: decentralization is expensive. The economic consequence is that you can only afford it where it truly matters. To date, among networks at scale, that’s been true only for the base layers of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. At most, that yields a few thousand decentralized transactions per second globally across all of them combined—a far cry from what global payments would require, even before you layer financial services on top. As a result, most transactions no longer occur on the base layers (L1s) but on a sprawling ecosystem of high‑throughput scaling solutions (L2s). L2s offer near‑zero fees and instant settlement, and they’re profitable because they internalize Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)—the gains from reordering, inserting, or omitting transactions in a block. While crypto purists might decry this trend, it aligns precisely with economic theory: users are willing to pay a premium for decentralization and censorship resistance at the core settlement layer, yet they readily trade some of that for greater centralization in higher layers to gain lower costs and faster speeds. The base layers remain open and trustless, and depending on the application, participants may compromise further—even embracing fully trusted, centralized solutions. This trade‑off is broader than a user’s decision to be their own bank and self‑custody funds versus accepting some degree of trust in a third‑party wallet. When building products, Coinbase, Robinhood, and the like care deeply that the underlying network stays neutral and does not play favorites among applications, developers, or businesses—the way the tech giants do on their platforms. Essentially, they are willing to pay for decentralization and neutrality to reduce the risk of hold‑up and expropriation—something that has repeatedly played out on traditional digital platforms. To fully grasp what fast, low‑cost L2s will do to payments and competition in crypto, look no further than what the internet did to news and media: as the cost of distributing—and now, with AI, also generating—large swaths of content fell to zero, business models had to evolve drastically, and massive aggregators (Google, Facebook, Spotify, etc.) emerged to take advantage of the new economics at play. Because L2s remove friction, offer convenience, and allow builders to deliver experiences much closer to traditional fintech products, they are the obvious layer where most of the value will be created—and appropriated. Furthermore, as basic money becomes free and commoditized, competition shifts to the value‑added services and workflows associated with it. That’s exactly where fintechs, neobanks, crypto exchanges, and even traditional financial institutions have a significant advantage. Any one of these players, if it executes well over the next couple of years, can use the technology to establish the first truly massive and global financial network. Once it reaches scale, it could also progressively degrade interoperability, appropriating more of the value—much as today’s internet giants did. So what’s the most likely scenario? Based on how strong and persistent network effects have been in crypto over the last decade, it’s safe to assume that payments and financial services will disproportionately gravitate toward a couple of leading blockchains. The remaining chains will need to specialize within an industry vertical to stay relevant. Most activity will take place not on their decentralized base layers but on scaling layers branded and shaped by crypto and fintech players (e.g., Base, Robinhood Chain), applications (e.g., Unichain, World Chain), and financial institutions (e.g., Kinexys, Fnality, Partior). Players that control distribution—whether on the consumer, merchant, or institutional side—have a massive advantage, as they own the interface between the blockchain and the real world. Blockchains drastically lower the cost of verifying and coordinating onchain data, but their value is limited without a strong nexus with complementary offchain information—identity, compliance, credentials, creditworthiness, and more. That’s where friction persists—and where economies of scale will decide winners and losers. This is why stablecoin issuers have strong incentives either to commoditize the rails—by issuing on multiple networks and positioning themselves at the center of interoperability across them (e.g., Circle’s Cross‑Chain Transfer Protocol)—or to nudge most activity to a network they control, such as a new L2 or a higher‑level protocol like CPN. Either strategy gives them a shot at becoming massive global fintech leaders and capturing most of the value the technology creates. Meanwhile, crypto and fintech players will want to shift those same valuable transactions to a network over which they have more sway, such as a branded L2. In doing so, they’ll also want either to commoditize stablecoins and other tokenized assets, or to issue their own. In the latter scenario, stablecoins may well be used as a loss leader to expand the reach of a fintech’s offering, and domestic stablecoins will be issued to gain more control over the FX market and support local use cases. Real‑world assets (RWAs), memecoins, other tokens, and applications that are truly differentiated and exclusive to those networks may also help these branded chains retain volume within their borders. The same companies will be able to develop clever rewards and loyalty programs that increase consumer and business stickiness within their ecosystems. As convenience and economic reality win over dogmatism, crypto will look very different than it is today. The good news is that, as part of that transformation, it will be far more useful. And while that may come with more centralization, the fact that the underlying protocols are open source and forkable means that, no matter how large some players may become, they face more pressure to retain greater interoperability than under the status quo. It is also possible that because crypto protocols allow for new market design and incentives, the ultimate solution will be something that was not quite achievable for the internet protocols—which did not have built‑in monetization mechanisms. Regardless, once centralization materializes, some clever group of developers will work hard to undo it, and the cycle will repeat.

Search The Points Guy As soon as people find out that I work for The Points Guy, they almost always follow up with one question: "What's the best credit card?" My answer is usually, "It depends" — because there truly is no one-size-fits-all credit card that's best for everyone. Several factors go into determining the best credit card for your situation, including your spending habits, your credit score and the type of rewards you want to earn. Some regular contenders frequently make the cut when I recommend new credit cards since they offer solid value for a variety of spenders and their lifestyles. I've had my fair share of them over my 20-plus years of collecting points and miles. Here are my top picks for the best credit cards you can add to your wallet. *TPG founder Brian Kelly is a Bilt adviser and investor. **The information for the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer. Check out how my top recommendations for the best credit cards stack up against each other. †You must use the card five times each statement period to earn points on rent and qualifying net purchases. Standout benefits: The Chase Sapphire Preferred was one of the first cards I opened that carried an annual fee. Initially, I got the card because it didn't charge foreign transaction fees, but I quickly fell in love with the rewards I was earning — both abroad and back in the U.S. By signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy. You may unsubscribe at any time. Chase Ultimate Rewards points are among the most valuable currencies out there, pegged at 2.05 cents each per TPG's August 2025 valuations. As a Sapphire Preferred cardholder, you can redeem your points through Chase Travel at a rate of 1.25 cents apiece, but my favorite way to use Chase points is by transferring them to travel partners like Air Canada Aeroplan and World of Hyatt. Hyatt is my go-to redemption option here, as I almost always get well over 2 cents per point in value from my award stays. For example, I splurged for four nights at the Hyatt Centric Park City earlier this year, and even though it set me back 180,000 points, the paid rate would've been nearly $6,000. I was even able to apply a suite upgrade as a Hyatt Globalist. Related: Why the Chase Sapphire Preferred should be your first card out of college Beyond that, the card offers an incredible set of travel protections if things go wrong on your trip, including primary car rental coverage. You'll also enjoy a $50 annual hotel credit for reservations made through Chase Travel. I eventually upgraded to the card's more premium sibling — the Chase Sapphire Reserve® (see rates and fees) — a few years ago, but my wife continues to hold her Sapphire Preferred and still gets incredible value from it. New applicants can earn 75,000 points after spending $5,000 on purchases within the first three months from account opening. The Sapphire Preferred features a $95 annual fee. For more information, check out our review of the Chase Sapphire Preferred. Apply here: Chase Sapphire Preferred Card Standout benefits: I picked up the Capital One Venture X shortly after it launched in November 2021, and it quickly became a workhorse in my wallet because it earns at least 2 miles per dollar spent on every purchase. I charge my utility bills and most of my online shopping to it, since those purchases generally aren't eligible for bonuses on other cards. The card also offers a ton of premium perks without a premium price tag. You'll enjoy access to Capital One Lounges and a Priority Pass Select membership, along with the ability to enjoy value-added benefits on luxury hotel stays via the Premier Collection and Lifestyle Collection. All of this comes with an annual fee of just $395. However, even that is super easy to offset with other perks on the card. You'll get an annual $300 credit for purchases via Capital One Travel — including flights, hotels and rental cars. You can also use the card for up to $120 in statement credits to cover the cost of a Global Entry or TSA PreCheck membership every four years. Related: Capital One Venture Rewards vs. Capital One Venture X Finally, when you renew your card, you'll receive 10,000 bonus miles on your account anniversary. Those are worth at least $100 if used for travel, but they have the potential for even more value when you redeem them with Capital One's 15-plus transfer partners. I recently transferred 70,000 Capital One miles to Air Canada Aeroplan to book a one-way business-class flight to Europe for Thanksgiving — a trip that would've otherwise set me back over $3,000. And that's just one method of maximizing your Capital One miles. New applicants can earn 75,000 miles after spending $4,000 on purchases within the first three months from account opening. This card features a $395 annual fee. For more information, check out our review of the Capital One Venture X. Learn more: Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card Standout benefits: Believe it or not, I first added the Amex Gold to my wallet without earning a welcome bonus. I held an earlier version of the card, so I wasn't eligible. However, I still earn tens of thousands of points on the card every year — and last year's refresh made me love it even more. I love dining out and cooking in, and the Amex Gold rewards you in both categories. You'll earn 4 points per dollar spent at restaurants worldwide (on up to $50,000 in purchases each year, then 1 point per dollar) and 4 points per dollar spent at U.S. supermarkets (on up to $25,000 in purchases each year, then 1 point per dollar). Membership Rewards points are super valuable — with partners like ANA Mileage Club and Air France-KLM Flying Blue. Related: How to maximize the Amex Gold's benefits However, the card can also save you money on everyday purchases as well, thanks to the following benefits (enrollment required): ***Uber Cash is valid on purchases in the U.S. and you must first add your Amex Gold to your Uber account. You can then redeem with any Amex card. In fact, I was getting so much value out of this card that my wife was convinced to get her own Amex Gold card last year — essentially doubling the value we can get from these statement credits every year. With the Amex Gold, you can find out your offer and see if you are eligible for as high as 100,000 Membership Rewards points after spending $6,000 on purchases within the first six months of card membership. Welcome offers vary, and you may not be eligible for an offer. This card's annual fee is $325. For more information, check out our review of the Amex Gold Card. Apply here: American Express Gold Card Standout benefits: Before I got the Capital One Venture X, I had the regular Venture Card — which is a great alternative for those who aren't willing to pay for a premium rewards card. You'll enjoy the same base earning rate of 2 miles per dollar spent on all purchases, and you'll enjoy access to Capital One's Lifestyle Collection of hotels around the world. The card also includes up to $120 in statement credits for a Global Entry or TSA PreCheck membership every four years — a rarity for a card with just a $95 annual fee. In addition, the Venture Card can be the perfect option for those just getting started who value simplicity but may want the option of maximizing rewards in the future. Capital One miles can be used to offset any travel purchase charged to the card at a value of 1 cent per point. However, you also have the ability to leverage Capital One's transfer partners for even more value. This gives you a great starting point — with the chance to unlock more rewards down the road. New applicants can earn 75,000 miles after spending $4,000 on purchases within the first three months from account opening. This card features a $95 annual fee. For more information, check out our review of the Capital One Venture Rewards. Learn more: Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card Standout benefits: I've held the Amex Platinum for years, and it's among the priciest travel cards out there, with a massive $695 annual fee. However, each time my card comes up for renewal, I crunch the numbers and realize that I easily get that much in value every year — and then some. For example, when you add the Amex Platinum to your Uber account, you'll receive $15 a month in Uber Cash plus a one-time bonus of $20 in the month of December (valid for rides and Uber Eats orders in the U.S.; can pay using any Amex card). I also enjoy the up to $20 a month in statement credits I receive for select digital entertainment providers, which I use to offset the cost of my daughter's Disney+ obsession (enrollment is required). Then there's the up to $200 airline fee statement credit each calendar year — which I mainly use for Sky Club guest access for my daughter. These three perks alone can offer me up to $640 in annual benefits, nearly covering the card's entire annual fee. Enrollment is required. Related: Maximizing the Amex Platinum's benefits Beyond these statement credits, the Amex Platinum offers unparalleled airport lounge access, including Centurion Lounges, Priority Pass lounges (enrollment is required) and Plaza Premium locations. You can also access Delta Sky Clubs when flying Delta Air Lines, though you are capped at 10 visits per year unless you spent $75,000 in the current (or previous) calendar year. There's nothing I love more than relaxing in a quiet space prior to a flight — and the Platinum Card delivers just that. With the Amex Platinum, you can find out your offer and see if you are eligible for as 175,000 Membership Rewards points after spending $8,000 on purchases in the first six months of card membership. Welcome offers vary, and you may not be eligible for an offer. This card's annual fee is $695. For more information, check out our review of the Amex Platinum Card. Apply here: Amex Platinum Standout benefits: I've been a longtime Delta flyer. In fact, I was a charter Diamond Medallion member when that elite status first launched in 2010 — qualifying entirely on domestic segments, no less. And even though I'm no longer a road warrior, I still love flying Delta. And the Delta Reserve Card helps make those trips even more rewarding. Even though it carries a hefty annual fee, the perks are extensive. You'll receive 2,500 Medallion Qualification Dollars (MQDs) each year just for having the card, putting you halfway to Silver Medallion status. You can then earn 1 MQD for every $10 spent on the card, allowing you to spend your way to status. The card also includes 15 visits to Sky Clubs every year plus four, one-time-use guest passes — though you can unlock unlimited visits as the primary cardmember when you spend $75,000 on purchases in a calendar year. But my favorite perk is the annual companion certificate you receive upon renewal. This allows you to bring a travel companion on select Delta-operated flights just by paying the taxes and fees. It's even valid on select Comfort+ and first-class tickets. Last year, I used this for a flight to Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC) for me and my daughter to go skiing, a ticket that would've otherwise been over $900. New applicants can earn 70,000 miles after spending $5,000 on purchases within the first six months of card membership. This card's annual fee is $650. For more information, check out our review of the Delta SkyMiles Reserve. Apply here: Delta SkyMiles Reserve Amex Standout benefits: You may be surprised to see a cash-back credit card on this list, but the Freedom Flex is so much more — let's start with the earning rates. Cardholders earn 5% cash back on the first $1,500 in combined purchases you spend each quarter in rotating bonus categories (after activation). With a wife and 10-year-old daughter, I spend a ton at Amazon, so that's a great return on purchases I'm already making. However, I'm not just earning cash back. Instead, since I also have the Chase Sapphire Reserve, I have the ability to combine these rewards in my Sapphire account — which effectively converts them to fully transferable Ultimate Rewards points. In other words, this card allows me to earn 5 Ultimate Rewards points per dollar spent on these rotating categories. Related: 4 reasons I recommend the Chase Freedom Flex to beginners In fact, I max out the quarterly bonus so frequently that I have both this card and the old Chase Freedom card (no longer available to new applicants) — which means I have double the earning potential each month. With this no-annual-fee card, new applicants can earn $200 after spending $500 on eligible purchases within the first three months of account opening. For more information, check out our review of the Chase Freedom Flex. Apply here: Chase Freedom Flex Standout benefits: The Ink Business Preferred can be a great fit for virtually any small business — but especially those with a big online presence. That's because of the bonus categories on the card. Each year, you'll earn 3 points per dollar on up to $150,000 in combined spending across the following categories: If you fully max out that bonus, you'll take home 450,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points — which can then be used for cash back, gift cards or trips through Chase's lucrative transfer partners. It also has no foreign transaction fees when you're outside the country, and with extensive travel and purchase protections for business trips, it can give you valuable peace of mind when on the road. New applicants can earn 90,000 points after spending $8,000 on purchases within the first three months from account opening. This card features a $95 annual fee. For more information, check out our review of the Ink Business Preferred. Apply here: Ink Business Preferred Standout benefits: The Bilt Mastercard is the one card on this list that I've never had. However, that's solely due to the fact that I own my home. If you're a renter, and you're not currently earning points on your monthly rent, this card should absolutely be in your wallet. That's because you can earn 1 point per dollar spent on rent (up to 100,000 points each calendar year) without paying any transaction fees (see rates and fees), as long as you charge at least five purchases to the card each month. This holds true even if your landlord or apartment management company isn't part of the Bilt Rewards program and doesn't accept credit cards. You can log in to the Bilt Rewards app and use your Bilt Mastercard to send a monthly rent check or direct deposit, earning points in the process. Related: Guide to the Bilt Rewards program In addition to rent, you also earn 5 points per dollar spent on Lyft (after you link your Bilt and Lyft accounts), 3 points per dollar spent on dining, 2 points per dollar spent on travel and 1 point per dollar spent on all other purchases. And Bilt Rewards Points are incredibly valuable, with a wildly lucrative list of transfer partners — including World of Hyatt and Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan. Plus, Bilt runs Rent Day promotions that allow you to earn even more points on your everyday purchases — and potentially get even more value from your redemptions. The Bilt card does not come with a welcome offer and does not charge an annual fee (see rates and fees). For more information, check out our review of the Bilt Mastercard. Apply here: Bilt Mastercard Standout benefits: It's true that I have a lot of premium credit cards, but if you're looking to up your hotel game, the Hilton Aspire Card can be a great option. Beyond the hefty welcome bonus, it also unlocks a ton of perks — both when staying at Hilton properties and across other spending activities. For starters, you'll enjoy automatic top-tier Hilton Honors Diamond status, just by holding the card. This grants you complimentary upgrades as well as a daily food-and-beverage credit at eligible properties in the U.S. (or complimentary breakfast at international locations). This status normally requires 60 nights to achieve, so this is a remarkable shortcut. Related: 7 reasons to get the Hilton Amex Aspire card In addition, you get a free night certificate when you open the card and then every year after renewal, and this can be used at virtually any Hilton property worldwide (with just a few exceptions). In addition, you'll enjoy up to $400 in annual statement credits at Hilton resort properties — up to $200 from January to June and up to $200 from July to December. Last year, I used the certificate to book the Conrad Fort Lauderdale Beach when the room rates were over $800 per night — and I used the $200 credit for the second half of the year to cover most of a spa treatment for my wife (it was her birthday). Talk about rewarding! Finally, I love the up to $200 in statement credits for airline purchases each year, broken up as $50 each quarter. I've used this for taxes and fees on award tickets as well as inflight food and beverage purchases. New applicants can earn 175,000 points after spending $6,000 on purchases in your first six months of card membership. This card features an annual fee of $550. For more information, check out our review of the Hilton Aspire Card. There's no denying that there are a lot of credit card options from which to choose. However, there are a few important things to consider when trying to pick the one that's best for you. However, one of the great things about having so many cards at your disposal is that you're not locked into a long-term commitment. If you want to try a new card, you can earn the welcome bonus and utilize the perks for the first year. Then, if it's not worth keeping, you can cancel it. (Just don't do it before the first year is up.) First, it's critical to think about your preferred rewards currency. Do you want cash back or travel points? Are you interested in rewards in a specific airline or hotel loyalty program? Part of this may be geographical. After all, earning American miles if you're based in Atlanta may not be worthwhile, given Delta's hub. However, if you live in Charlotte or Philadelphia, American may be a much better option. Alternatively, consider earning transferable rewards on cards like the Sapphire Preferred, Amex Gold or Capital One Venture. These points or miles convert to a number of airline and hotel partners, allowing you to book premium flights or luxury hotels by leveraging program sweet spots. Most cards offer welcome bonuses to new applicants, and these are a great way to quickly boost your account balance. Cards sometimes offer limited-time, elevated offers, so if you time it right, you could take home a ton of points or miles that can go a long way toward your next trip. Before you commit to a new card, take stock of your everyday spending habits. Most cards offer extra rewards in select categories of purchases, so you should pick one that matches where you spend your money. Are you a prolific chef at home? Go for a card with a category bonus at grocery stores. Love dining out? Get one with a bonus at restaurants. Or, if your spending is all over the place, get a card that offers a solid earning rate on all purchases. Finally, consider whether the cost of the card is worth it. The most rewarding cards out there typically impose an annual fee, and while this confers many perks, not all of them may be useful to you. While the welcome bonus typically offers enough value in year one, it's a harder decision after that. Crunch the actual, real-world value you can get from the card to make sure you get at least enough to cover the annual fee. Related: The 7 best credit cards with annual fees under $100 We chose the best credit cards based on a range of factors, including earning rates, welcome offers, benefits and perks. To read more about how TPG evaluates and chooses cards to spotlight in our roundups, check out our methodology. It's no coincidence that the vast majority of the cards on this list earn transferable rewards (the only exceptions are the Delta SkyMiles Reserve and the Chase Freedom Flex, though the latter becomes transferable in my wallet when paired with the Sapphire Reserve). That's because this type of rewards offers immense flexibility to book incredibly valuable trips. For example, let's say you want to book a flight to London by leveraging your Amex Platinum. Your first option is through American Express Travel, which offers a value of 1 cent per point. Alternatively, you can transfer Amex points to Delta, though SkyMiles award rates tend to be sky high. However, there's another option: Transfer your Amex points to Virgin Atlantic Flying Club, which can offer incredibly low rates to Europe — including economy and business class. Whenever someone asks me to name the best credit card, I always say that it depends. There are so many cards that could work for the average traveler, so it's critical to take some time to analyze what you want out of a card and where you spend your money. And if you're still overwhelmed, you really can't go wrong with any of the cards on this list — especially if you want to dip your toes into maximizing your rewards for your next trip.

Title: Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. Reminds Investors in IRobot (IRBT) of the Class Action Lawsuit and Encourages Investors to Inquire About Their Rights

August 11, 2025 19:37 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. Litigation Attorneys Encourage Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in any of the above companies between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, Aug. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: China and the US clash at the UN over the Panama Canal, a focus of Trump’s attention

By EDITH M. LEDERER UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States and China clashed over the Panama Canal at the United Nations on Monday, with the U.S. warning that Beijing’s influence over the key waterway could threaten global trade and security and China calling U.S. accusations a pretext to take over the canal. The clash took place at a U.N. Security Council meeting where Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino stressed the neutrality of the canal and his country’s ownership of the waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Panama holds the council presidency this month, and Mulino was chairing a meeting on challenges to maritime security. Interpol Secretary General Valdecy Urquiza told members these include piracy, armed robbery, transnational crime and cyber criminals weaponizing artificial intelligence to attack ports where there is “minimal cyber security, maximum exposure.” U.S. President Donald Trump thrust Panama into the spotlight even before winning election last November by suggesting that his country should consider retaking control of the Panama Canal and accusing Panama of ceding influence to China. The U.S. built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Control of the waterway transferred to Panama in 1999 under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. China’s U.N. Ambassador Fu Cong emphasized to the council that “Panama has consistently and effectively managed the canal, making significant contributions to global shipping and trade.” “China has always respected the permanent neutrality of the canal and firmly supports Panama in safeguarding its sovereignty over the canal to ensure its openness and smooth operation,” he said. Acting U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea, who spoke afterward, went after China, expressing concern about its “outsized influence over the Panama Canal area, especially over critical infrastructure and port operations.” Alluding to its claims in the South China Sea, she said, “China’s expansive and unlawful maritime claims and aggressive actions demonstrate its threat to maritime security and commerce.” She said the U.S. rejects these claims and supports countries opposing them. “China’s influence in the canal area is not just a risk to Panama and the United States, but rather a potential threat to global trade and security,” Shea said. The Trump administration has pressured China to have the Hong Kong-based operator of ports at either end of the canal sell those interests to a U.S. consortium that includes BlackRock Inc. Panama has vehemently rejected a takeover of the canal, but in April, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited Panama and agreed with Mulino to step up security coordination. The agreement also gives U.S. troops access to strategic air and naval facilities in the Central American nation, which sparked large protests in Panama’s capital. China’s Fu asked for the floor to respond to Shea’s accusations after all council members spoke, this time lashing out at the Trump administration. “The United States’ fabrication of lies and groundless attacks against China are nothing but a pretext for seeking control of the canal,” he said. The Chinese envoy called the U.S. and its deployment of offensive weapons in the South China Sea area “the biggest disrupter of peace and stability” in the region, and he accused the administration of exacerbating risks to global maritime security. “China firmly opposes economic coercion and bullying practices and urges the United States to stop fabricating rumors, lies and creating trouble,” Fu said. Murillo then responded, saying he wanted to stress Panama’s sovereignty “in terms of the ownership of the canal” and the multilateral treaty governing its administration. He called the canal’s neutrality “the only and the best defense” to any specific or global threats.

Title: TMTG moves closer to launching spot Bitcoin ETF with amended S-1 filing

The prospective Truth Social Bitcoin ETF moves closer to reality as Trump Media files amendments, intensifying focus on its ambitious crypto vision. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) has filed its first amended registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, advancing plans to enter the fast-growing spot Bitcoin ETF market. The ETF, to be listed on NYSE Arca under the ticker B.T., will hold Bitcoin (BTC) directly and seek to track the flagship crypto’s market price. Crypto.com will act as the exclusive custodian, prime execution agent, and liquidity provider, while Yorkville America Digital will serve as the ETF’s sponsor. The ETF’s structure allocates 70% of its assets to Bitcoin, with 15% in U.S. Treasury securities and 15% in cash or cash equivalents, aiming to balance exposure to the crypto with traditional financial instruments. The launch remains subject to SEC approval of both the updated Form S-1 registration and a separate Form 19b-4 listing application. The company has not provided a specific launch date but indicated it expects the fund to go live before year-end. TMTG, parent of the Truth Social social platform, streaming service Truth+, and fintech brand Truth.Fi, said the ETF forms part of a broader Bitcoin-focused strategy. The strategy includes building a corporate Bitcoin treasury and expanding into digital asset products through its financial services division. The company has already committed substantial capital to Bitcoin acquisitions this year, positioning itself among the more aggressive corporate entrants into the sector. If approved, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF would enter a competitive landscape dominated by heavyweight issuers such as BlackRock, whose spot Bitcoin ETF has drawn billions in inflows since the first U.S. approvals in January and set multiple records. The ETFs have attracted a mix of institutional and retail investors seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin without the need for self-custody. The filing also highlights the political dimension of TMTG’s crypto ambitions. President Donald Trump, the company’s majority shareholder, has made digital assets a policy priority, pledging to roll back what he calls restrictive regulations and promote U.S. leadership in the crypto economy. A spot Bitcoin ETF tied to a political brand of Trump’s profile would be unprecedented in the market, potentially attracting a distinct investor base but also intensifying public and regulatory scrutiny. The timing of the filing reflects an environment where spot Bitcoin ETFs are gaining mainstream acceptance and competitive differentiation is becoming critical. While the SEC has approved multiple products this year, new entrants face the challenge of building liquidity and investor trust in a market already served by established issuers.

Title: REX Osprey Solana ETF posts zero net flows across majority of August sessions

The main reasons are likely lack of institutional interest and the complicated structure which the ETF is based on, analysts weigh in. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. REX Osprey Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF) recorded zero trading activity on four of six trading days through August 8, according to Farside Investors data. Trading under ticker SSK, the fund posted no flows on Aug. 1, Aug. 4, Aug. 5, and Aug. 7, with minimal $6.4 million in activity on Aug. 8 and $2.7 million outflows on Aug. 6. REX Osprey’s fund is the first US-listed Solana ETF to integrate native staking mechanisms. The product operates outside standard SEC-registered spot ETF frameworks, delivering SOL exposure through indirect vehicles rather than direct crypto holdings. CoinShares flow data showed Solana products attracted $874 million in year-to-date inflows, staying behind Ethereum (ETH) and XRP among major cap altcoins despite its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The trading pattern could reflect broader institutional hesitation toward Solana-focused investment products compared to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum alternatives. Nansen senior research analyst Jake Kennis attributed the disparity to institutional portfolio allocation strategies. He explained in a note: “ETH is seeing a lot of new activity as institutions were likely underweight ETH relative to BTC. Solana has been mostly in the backseat for this new wave of attention, but SOL ETFs would likely pick up if institutions are looking to also diversify away from BTC and ETH.” The REX Osprey fund’s design incorporates staking mechanisms and offshore ETF allocations that differentiate it from traditional spot cryptocurrency products. Stabolut founder and CEO Eneko Knörr identified these features as adoption obstacles rather than demand deficiencies. Knörr said: “SSK’s quiet tape looks more like a brand and distribution issue than a pure demand problem. Its design isn’t a simple ‘spot SOL in a wrapper’—the fund stakes SOL and can allocate a portion into other SOL ETFs/ETPs, many offshore, which adds complexity that some buyers shy away from.” The fund charges a 0.75% management fee, positioning it at the higher end of cryptocurrency ETF expense ratios. Traditional spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs from major issuers typically carry fees between 0.15% and 0.25%. Kennis, from Nansen, noted that the fee structure creates a cost-benefit analysis for institutional investors weighing direct cryptocurrency exposure against ETF convenience. He referenced Solana’s approximately 7% annual staking rewards: “The staking component seems like a major feature given the ‘passive’ yield being left on the table.” The absence of major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity in the Solana ETF space contributes to limited market penetration. REX Shares operates as a smaller ETF issuer without the distribution networks and brand recognition of Wall Street’s largest asset managers. Knörr argued: “Early trading will likely remain lumpy until bigger brands enter the space. Structure, complexity, and limited shelf space are holding it back—interest in Solana exposure itself doesn’t appear to be the issue.” As of Aug. 11, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still considering the approval of Solana ETFs under the more tax-friendly 1933 Act.

Title: Why The Trump Administration MAGA Stock Dreams For Fannie And Freddie Could Be A Windfall For Wall Street

BySergei Klebnikov BySergei Klebnikov, Forbes Staff. The Trump administration is teeing up what could be the biggest shakeup in U.S. housing finance since the 2008 crisis—a pair of IPOs that might value Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at a combined $500 billion. The plan, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and is still being finalized by the administration, would see the federal government sell between 5% and 15% of each company, potentially raising about $30 billion in what would be one of the largest stock offerings in American history. Yet behind the fanfare lies a precarious gamble on institutions still tethered to taxpayer support and whose profitability is largely cushioned by an implicit government guarantee. Senior administration officials have in recent days confirmed the plans are far along, though crucial structural decisions—such as whether to list the two separately or together—remain unresolved. President Trump himself has signaled his intention to proceed with the listings this year: “I am working on TAKING THESE AMAZING COMPANIES PUBLIC, but I want to be clear, the U.S. Government will keep its implicit GUARANTEES,” he wrote on social media last week. On Saturday, he posted an edited picture of himself ringing the opening bell at the NYSE for a hypothetical, combined entity called the Great American Mortgage Corporation trading under the ticker “MAGA.” The Treasury—which currently holds the bulk of both government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) equity—could release new shares, sell existing ones, or blend both strategies to create liquidity. Wall Street heavyweights such as JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Bank of America have reportedly been asked to advise on pricing and structure. The history of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is a cautionary tale. Fannie’s roots stretch back to 1938, Freddie’s to 1970; Both were designed to keep mortgage credit flowing by securitizing and guaranteeing home loans. Their business model—buying mortgages from lenders, bundling them into mortgage-backed securities and guaranteeing payment to investors—helped lower borrowing costs for generations of Americans. During the mid-2000s housing boom, both ramped up exposure to riskier loans and loosened underwriting standards, leaving them vulnerable when home prices crashed. During the housing bubble the top executives of these quasi-governmental agencies benefited from compensation packages in the tens of millions. By September 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) had placed them into conservatorship after a combined $187 billion Treasury rescue, wiping out most private shareholder value. In the years since, the GSEs have returned to profitability, paying dividends that exceeded the bailout amount. Yet they have remained under government control, their retained earnings capped for much of the past decade until capital buffers were gradually rebuilt. FHFA’s 2024 Annual Report to Congress shows that by year-end, Fannie Mae’s total equity had grown $17 billion to $94.7 billion, while Freddie Mac’s climbed 24.8% to $59.6 billion. In a brief published earlier this year by Jim Parrott of the Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, and Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, the two highlighted the importance of keeping the implicit federal guarantee post-IPO. “Critical to the rating agencies and the Fed is not that the GSEs posed little risk, but that they enjoyed the unlimited backing of the U.S. government,” they write, warning that without that support, funding costs could climb sharply—driving up mortgage rates by 0.6 to 0.9 percentage points as well as shrinking credit access. The pair go on to caution that ending conservatorship without a clear legislative or financial framework risks delivering “no value,” and could leave the system “less liquid and stable.” “We believe it’s essential for the government to retain the explicit government guarantee if they pursue privatization, which could take years to implement,” wrote Lawrence Gillum, chief fixed income Strategist for LPL Financial. “Removing the guarantee would disrupt both markets and make housing even less affordable.” A $30 billion stock sale by the Federal government would provide a one-time boost to Treasury’s coffers but it would only represent an estimated 1.6% slice of the current fiscal year’s projected $1.9 trillion deficit. After the sale it is likely that the Federal government would still own 85% to 95% of the government sponsored mortgage companies and thus benefit from any appreciation in its share price. The windfall would also extend beyond the public purse. Hedge fund billionaires such as Bill Ackman and John Paulson, who built large positions in the mortgage giants years ago betting on their return to the market, could reap outsized rewards if the IPOs hit their targets. Ackman, who has long advocated for the privatization of the two GSEs, owns roughly 10% of the common stock of both Fannie and Freddie through his fund, Pershing Square Capital Management. Ackman’s firm first invested in Fannie and Freddie common stock in late 2013, roughly five years after they were put under government conservatorship during the financial crisis. His cost basis for each averaged just over $2 per share. Today, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae currently trade at $9 per share and $11.50 per share, respectively. According to previous filings from his firm (Pershing Square stopped disclosing these specific holdings in regular filings several years ago), he owned 115.5 million shares of Fannie and 63.5 million shares of Freddie—that stake today would be worth roughly $1.8 billion. Wall Street underwriters also stand to collect millions in advisory fees. Banks like Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase were top originators for Freddie and Fannie last year, while institutions like BlackRock and PIMCO are significant holders of mortgage backed securities. If the Trump administration pulls it off, the planned Fannie and Freddie offerings could rank among the most ambitious privatizations in modern U.S. history. Still, trying to privatize much of the nation’s mortgage infrastructure during the worst housing affordability crisis in a generation will be no easy task, as critics have pointed out. The current administration will no doubt need to be more specific and methodical than they have been so far if they want to avoid losing investor confidence and causing a shock to the financial system.

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The case of the "missing shares" started in 2021, and has wound its way through several jurisdictions. A takeover could be next. PARIS — SMCP, the parent company of Sandro, Maje, Claudie Pierlot, and Fursac, has regained control of a 15.5 percent stake of its capital as a result of a ruling by the Singapore High Court, following a lengthy legal battle. The group said Monday after market close that the shares — previously transferred in 2021 to Dynamic Treasure Group, a trust registered in the British Virgin Islands — have officially been returned to European TopSoho, a Luxembourg-based holding entity and former majority shareholder of SMCP. The return of the shares follows a July 4 decision by the court in Singapore, where the shares were being held. Related Articles Financial SMCP Q2 Sales Up 3% With Full-price Strategy Boosting Growth Financial SMCP Secures Singapore Court Victory in Battle Over Disputed Share Transfer “The return of the shares clarifies SMCP’s shareholding situation,” the company said in a statement. “The group remains focused on executing its profitable growth strategy, leveraging the desirability of its brands, its operational agility, and ongoing efforts in cost management.” You May Also Like The 15.5 percent stake has been at the center of a years-long shareholder dispute dating back to the financial collapse of Chinese conglomerate Shandong Ruyi, which had acquired a majority stake in SMCP in 2016 through European TopSoho ahead of the group’s 2017 initial public offering. This is the latest twist of the “missing shares” case that began in 2021, when 15.5 percent of the share capital “disappeared” from Luxembourg and reappeared in the British Virgin Islands two-and-a-half months later. They reappeared in the accounts of Dynamic Treasure Group, also controlled by European TopSoho director Chenran Qiu, the daughter of Shandong Ruyi’s founder. European TopSoho had sold them to Dynamic Treasure Group for a symbolic one euro. In the interim, European TopSoho also issued a press release denying Qiu’s involvement in Dynamic Treasure Group, misleading the market. The Singapore court ruling followed a similar decision by the English High Court in July 2024, which canceled the sale of the shares to Dynamic Treasure Group. Jurisdiction moved to Singapore, where the shares were being held in local accounts. European TopSoho, which entered bankruptcy proceedings in February 2023, is now under the control of a court-appointed administrator in Luxembourg. The return of the 15.5 percent stake won’t immediately change control of SMCP but does bring greater transparency to investors. London-based GLAS currently acts as trustee for European TopSoho’s creditors, including BlackRock, Carlyle, Anchorage, Boussard and Gavaudan, who remain SMCP’s largest shareholders. Last year, GLAS revealed its intention to offload 37 percent of the group’s shares — a move that could trigger a mandatory takeover under French law if a single buyer snaps them up. In its second-quarter financial results released July 29, SMCP posted 3.3 percent organic sales growth to 304.5 million euros, as the group doubled down on full-price sales and tighter inventory controls. Chief executive officer Isabelle Guichot’s recovery strategy continues to focus on stabilizing the business following store closures in China, while expanding in new markets including India and the Philippines, and focusing investment on its core brands Sandro and Maje.

Title: Diamond Comics Was Losing $1.3 Million Dollars A Week This April Alone

Posted in: Comics, Current News | Tagged: Ad Populum, diamond Diamond Comic Distributors was burning through 1.3 million dollars a week back in April this year A transcript from the Diamond Comic Distributors chapter 11 bankruptcy court session held on the 30th of April has been unsealed. Checking the Bleeding Cool Diamond Bankruptcy Timeline, we discover that this is the day that the courts approved of the sale of Diamond Comic Distributors to the joint back-up bid of Universal and Ad Populum. But it was also the day after the bankruptcy auction winners Alliance Entertainment or AENT sued Diamond Comic Distributors Inc, the debtors in this case, for fraud, alleging the debtors withheld information about their Wizards of the Coast contract. WOTC withdrew from supplying Diamond after the auction, a contract worth tens of millions of dollars a year, and it was AENT's contention that Diamond knew this was coming and withheld the information from AENT, as it would have affected the bid price, something they estimated at around $13 million. Without Diamond agreeing to such a price reduction, AENT pulled out of their $85 million bid for Diamond. As a result, the backup – and originally preferred – bidders of Universal and Ad Populum were chosen, albeit for only $72.3 million, a $7.6 million cut for Universal and $5.5 million for Ad Populum on their auction bids, after renegotiation. Chief Judge David Rice presided over the proceedings. Attorney Mark Minuti of Saul Ewing, representing Diamond Comic Distributors, Inc., the debtors in the chapter 11 bankruptcy case, opened by providing context on the case's rapid deterioration. "A lot has been happening in the case, Your Honor, and unfortunately, most of what's happening has not been good." Detailing the supplier fallout, Robert Gorin, co-Chief Revenue Officer at Diamond, took to the witness stand, and was asked by the Judge if they considered opening the sale to the wider market again, as they did in the original auction. He replied, "Time is not our friend here. We are burning cash… about 1.2, 1.3 million a week." Now this was back in April, of course. But there is nothing to suggest this has gone down. In the Diamond financial filings for May 2025, the most recent such document that has been filed, if we exclude the comics and games business asset sales entries, the remaining loss appears to be approximately a $12 million loss for that month. Of this, the loss on sales alone, not counting payroll, rent, and other operating expenses, was reported as a $7.5 million loss. Diamond's professional fees and expenses, to Raymond James Financial, Getzler Henrich & Associates, and lead counsel Saul Ewing, LLP, were reported to be $1,182,225 for that month. Gorin told us "On April 17th we got an unexpected email from a vendor, an important vendor that said they were not going to renew their contract with the company." This is Wizards Of The Coasts of course, efforts to reverse this included a video conference, but "ultimately they came back the next day in writing and said they were not going to change their mind." Jason Teele of Sills Cummis & Gross, representing AENT, objected to the expedited hearing, citing less than twelve hours' notice and questioning a price reduction coincidence, saying "the purchase price under the new Sale Agreement has been reduced by an aggregate of approximately 13 or so million dollars, which is almost precisely the same amount that Raymond James, the Debtors investment bankers suggested to Alliance's investment bankers would be an appropriate reduction in the purchase price given the loss of the Debtor's largest vendor contract had the Debtors negotiated that issue with Alliance in good faith, which, of course, they did not. So it's very curious that a reduction in price of the same magnitude that was called for upon discovery of this material adverse change is exactly the reduction in purchase price offered to the backup bidder." He also wasn't happy that paperwork was being redacted. "It's concerning to Alliance, and I suggest it should be concerning to the Court, that the provision of the Universal Asset Purchase Agreement discussing material adverse changes and what can and can't be done in the event of a material adverse change is redacted… what do those redactions or unredacted version of that paragraph actually disclose? We don't know. I have theories, but those are just theories and speculation." As for those theories suggested by Teele, we can read between the lines. "There was no accounting for the fraud that we encountered as part of the closing process. That is the subject — one of the subjects of the Adversary Proceeding that I expect will be fully heard by the Court in due course. But I just want to point out that but for the discovery of that information, which had been concealed from at least Alliance, perhaps other bidders as well, we would have closed last Friday." It is worth knowing that Diamond owes AENT a significant sum as well, from the auction process. Teele added, "But I suggest that Alliance does have standing, not only as a prepetition Creditor holding a small dollar claim, but also as a postpetition Creditor to the extent of the $8.5 million deposit, which the Debtors have unreasonably refused to refund" Judge Rice asked Robert Gorin if Diamond had "ever given any thought to simply shutting down the business and liquidating the inventory or the other assets that were there?" Gorin replied, "We did, and we also had these conversations with the consultation parties as well, and our liquidation analysis shows it's significantly lower recovery to liquidate than to sell." And on why an extension in the DIP funding from JPMorgan Chase was necessary, "we need to keep running the company in the ordinary course, we need to be able to make payroll, we need to be able to pay our vendors and keep the airplane flying. As I keep telling everybody, we're trying to hold the airplane together while we're flying, and that is what we're trying to do. And we need the lender's help to do that." The DIP was extended but those vendors didn't seem to get paid. At least not yet. Gianfranco Finizio of Lowenstein Sandler, representing the Unsecured Creditors' Committee, supported the sales despite frustrations, saying, "We now find ourselves pivoting to the backup bidders. They've been, unfortunately, opportunistic. You've heard Mr. Minuti describe the value degradation in the bids. But we don't have a backup to the backup bidder. We don't have the luxury of time to go out and market these assets. The Committee thinks that we need to stop the bleed immediately, whether that's the bleed of finding a new buyer, the $1.2 million burn that Mr. Minuti referenced… These sales in this case should not be run for the sole benefit of JPM. You know, two weeks ago, we were in a very different scenario where we were in the money, and there was excess proceeds. But now, a lot has changed, and this sale cannot be just for the sole benefit of paying JPMorgan down and leaving administrative Creditors exposed" and adding "it's as clear as mud to us on what the post-sale Estate looks like". That would be JPMorgan Chase, the banks, represented by Jonathan Young of Troutman Pepper Locke who echoed support for the sale but noted the burn rate's impact: "The longer it takes to get to a monetization event, the greater the burn, the more my client has to consider lending, and the less distributable value for everyone." The US Trustee Gerard Vetter observed without opposition, citing "concerning allegations" but deferring on the sale. Judge Rice approved the motions, finding them a "sound exercise of the business judgment by the Debtors." He noted the "unusual course of events" but emphasised urgency: "That it's been a little bit difficult… is the reason why approving these matters today… is really necessary to protect the value of this Estate." It has been 31 weeks since Diamond entered Chapter 11. I refer the honourable members to the case of Jarndyce vs Jarndyce in Bleak House by Charles Dickens… You can use these Diamond tabs to keep up with the latest on Bleeding Cool.

The longstanding belief that a computer science degree from a top US university guarantees a high-paying job is increasingly being challenged. Despite booming enrollments, many graduates struggle to find work due to AI-driven automation, tech industry layoffs, and shifting employer priorities. Entry-level coding jobs are disappearing, while AI tools now dominate both programming and the hiring process. Experts emphasize that success no longer depends solely on degree or basic coding skills but requires deep expertise, problem-solving ability, and specialized knowledge in AI, system design, or physical sciences. Students are urged to adapt through learning, niche specialization, and alternative careers.

Time Published: 2025-08-11T18:14:28Z

Club: Blackrock/Leinster County: Wexford Age: 22 Position: Flanker Wafer had been an injury concern after knee surgery, but is thankfully included in the World Cup squad. She won the 2025 Six Nations Player of the Tournament, was part of the 2024 World Rugby Dream Team, and was player of the match in the victory over New Zealand at the WXV1 tournament last year. Following the World Cup, she’s set for a move to Harlequins. Club: Railway Union/Munster County: Tipperary Age: 30 Position: Winger Perhaps best known for her Sevens antics, having been part of the Ireland team at the Paris Olympics, Costigan (formerly Murphy Crowe) is the Irish record-holder for most tries and was a try-scorer against England in this year’s Six Nations. Club: Railway Union County: Westmeath Age: 26 Position: Outside centre Another Sevens recruit, McGann was unlucky to miss out on the Olympics due to injury. She came back to the 15s to score a hat-trick of tries against Italy in the Six Nations and touched down twice in the warm-up game against Canada. Club: Blackrock/Connacht County: Roscommon Age: 24 Position: Scrumhalf Two ACL injuries within nine months haven’t prevented Reilly from returning to full strength and earning a spot on the plane to England. The Roscommon native has been part of the Sevens system since 2021 and got her first 15s cap in 2022, amassing a further 16 since. Club: Old Belvedere/Leinster County: Offaly Age: 22 Position: Inside centre Named in the 2025 Six Nations Team of the Tournament, and player of the match in Ireland’s win over Italy, Dalton finished last season with a Women’s Player’s Player of the Year at the Rugby Player Ireland Awards. One to watch. Club: Blackrock/Connacht County: Galway Age: 23 Position: Winger Despite her youth, Parsons is already a stalwart of the team, making history in 2016 as the youngest player to play a senior game for Ireland at 16.

Now plays with Exeter since a move in 2022. Club: Blackrock/Leinster County: Laois Age: 27 Position: Lock Balancing her burgeoning rugby career with studying medicine, the Laois woman was part of the Leinster team that defeated Munster in the 2024 Interpros and was Player of the Match in Leinster’s victory over Ulster. Club: Blackrock/Munster County: Cork Age: 26 Position: Scrumhalf Lane made her Sevens debut in 2018, followed by her 15s debut in 2021. At the Paris Olympics, where Lane was the fifth most capped Irish player, she went viral when Erin King brought her safely to ground despite nearly tipping backwards over her team-mate’s head during a lift. Club: Blackrock/Munster County: Cork Age: 26 Position: Outhalf/centre A physiotherapist by trade, Breen has been a veteran of the 15s squad since her debut as a teenager in 2019 against France. She captained Ireland during their successful WXV1 campaign.

She’s scored nine tries over her 27 caps at international 15s level and also featured at the Paris Olympics. Club: Old Belvedere/Leinster County: Dublin Age: 28 Position: Second row A former Dublin footballer, Tuite was introduced to rugby through the Sevens set up. She first took up 15s in college where she studied physiotherapy. Despite being unlucky with injuries, she has amassed 17 caps with the senior team. Club: Trailfinders Women County: IQ/London Age: 29 Position: Back row Scouted by the IQ Programme while playing for Richmond in the Premiership, Moore has played for Ireland in both Sevens and 15s.

County: Dublin Club: Old Belvedere/Leinster Age: 29 Position: Prop The most capped player on the squad with 48, Djougang has been a constant for Ireland since her first cap in 2019. She’s scored 45 Six Nations points and was named Player of the Year at the 2025 Leinster Rugby awards. County: Dublin Club: Manawatu RFC/ Leinster Age: 27 Position: Scrumhalf Encouraged to take up rugby by her then teacher, former Ireland player Fiona Coghlan, Scuffil McCabe has played both Sevens and 15s.

Club: Galwegians/Connacht County: Galway Age: 32 Position: Outhalf Last year’s Connacht Player of the Year, Fowley earned her first international cap in November 2016 against England.

Scored 52 points in this year’s Celtic Challenge. Club: Old Belvedere/Leinster County: Kildare Age: 22 Position: Second row In her first international game, Campbell started against Australia in September 2024, lasting the full 80 minutes. Her first Six Nations start came in March against France. Previously played for Naas before moving to Old Belvedere. Club: Cooke RFC/Ulster County: Donegal Age: 21 Position: Prop McGrath has had a rapid rise to the senior international squad, having got into rugby when she was 14. Since then, she’s played under-18s for Ulster and Ireland, and captained the Clovers against Byrthon Thunder. Club: Gloucester Hartpury/Ulster County: Meath Age: 32 Position: Second row Former Meath footballer, Monaghan offers leadership and experience in this young side. In 2024, she co-captained the team for the Six Nations with Edel McMahon but was unlucky to miss out on this year’s campaign due to injury. Club: Railway Union/Munster County: Clare Age: 30 Position: Prop/second row McCarthy picked up rugby after Ireland’s Grand Slam in 2013, joining Shannon RFC before eventually persuading her twin Kate to do the same, later playing together for Railway Union. Got her first international cap in 2024 in a 36-10 victory over Australia in Belfast. Club: Railway Union/ Leinster County: Dublin Age: 29 Position: Back/outhalf Flood has played Sevens rugby for more than a decade having started in 2013. Another Paris Olympian, she returned to the 15s set-up for the Six Nations after the Celtic Challenge Cup, in which she was one of the leading carriers and kickers for the Wolfhounds. Club: Blackrock/Connacht County: Galway Age: 24 Position: Fullback Deeley was one of six Irish debutantes during the Japan Test Series in 2022. A college student at the time, she had a rugby scholarship from Trinity College Dublin and is a Geoscience graduate.

Title: On theCUBE Pod: OpenAI’s ecosystem play, Nvidia’s open-source question and the race for AI dominance
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/08/11/openai-ecosystem-play-nvidias-open-source-ai-dominance-thecubepod/
Time Published: 2025-08-11T18:01:50Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 14:01 EDT / AUGUST 11 2025 by Chad Wilson The OpenAI ecosystem is undergoing a rapid transformation, redefining how frontier artificial intelligence models are deployed, monetized and integrated into enterprise workflows. With moves that widen its partnerships beyond long-standing alliances, OpenAI Inc. is positioning itself for a new era of scale, developer adoption and competitive resilience. In this week’s episode of theCUBE Pod, John Furrier (pictured, left), executive analyst at theCUBE Research, and Dave Vellante (right), chief analyst at theCUBE Research, talk about how industry watchers are tracking a confluence of strategic shifts: horizontal expansion into multiple cloud environments, fresh licensing approaches through open weights and the unveiling of GPT-5 with improved coding capabilities. These developments OpenAI ecosystem come amid rising speculation about an IPO and a potential recalibration of the company’s relationship with Microsoft Corp. “This is a huge deal because it’s the open-source license. There’s a story hiding in plain sight that no one’s talking about,” Furrier said. “I think the signaling that I’m reading between the tea leaves is OpenAI is losing the relationship; there’s a breakup coming with Microsoft’s. Clearly decoupling going on.” OpenAI’s decision to launch on Amazon Web Services Inc., with models running from day one, marks a notable broadening of its cloud presence. This strategic alignment not only grants AWS a new AI asset in its portfolio but also gives OpenAI access to thousands of enterprise customers beyond Microsoft Azure. The company’s simultaneous move to make open-weight models available could further entice developers seeking to customize AI for their specific verticals, opening up the OpenAI ecosystem even more according to Vellante. “I was on the Nvidia analyst call. The big question is what’s OpenAI’s commitment to open source,” he said. “It’s not only open source, it’s open weights. To me, that’s the more interesting piece of this because if it’s open weights, then enterprises can customize it for their own needs, but it’s a GPT-3 class model. It’s now two generations behind the state-of-the-art because today GPT-5 came out.” The launch of GPT-5 underscores how quickly the competitive landscape is evolving. OpenAI’s latest model delivers notable improvements in reasoning, accuracy and code generation — areas critical to AI’s next adoption wave. Paired with a multicloud strategy, these product advances hint at an intentional decoupling from Microsoft in favor of a more balanced partner portfolio, Furrier explained. “OpenAI clearly is playing an ecosystem play,” he said. “If you look at the narratives … it is absolutely a go-to-market ecosystem move by OpenAI. they are clearly going horizontal in the execution. That is a direct counter to a relationship with Microsoft that is a decoupling hedge or intentional plan to expand the base.” Beyond the OpenAI ecosystem narrative, the discussion also touched on other significant developments shaping tech and business strategy. From policy-driven shifts in crypto markets to legacy chipmakers facing innovation pressure, theCUBE’s coverage continues to link macro trends with on-the-ground insight from key venues. At events such as Black Hat, AI security implications remain top of mind. Meanwhile, on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, conversations in the “NYSE Wired: Crypto Trailblazers” series are bringing together founders, investors and policymakers to discuss the future of digital assets — especially as the GENIUS Act introduces clearer regulations for stablecoins and institutional adoption accelerates, according to Furrier. “This is going to bring in Fidelity, it’s going to bring in all the top people,” he said. “You can now back stable coins with payments. All the deposit institutions, federal agencies, the regulatory antiquated system has been the bottleneck in crypto. GENIUS Act is one, the AI stuff that they’re doing, these are policy things that they’re grinding out and people don’t appreciate this.” Chip industry challenges were also spotlighted through analysis of Intel’s recent struggles and strategic opportunities. Calls from former Intel board members for structural and IP-related changes reflect a broader urgency for U.S. semiconductor competitiveness, particularly against ARM-based architectures and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd’s cost advantages, Vellante detailed. “The problem with their scenario … is Operation Warp Speed might work for vaccines, but it doesn’t work for silicon,” Vellante said. “The second, as I said, the cap table is too complicated. The third is it completely leaves TSM out of the picture. You take their cash and you take their commitment and you give them guaranteed supply over time. And the cap table is the U.S. government, U.S. taxpayers, TSM, maybe throw Intel a little bone and then the private equity.” Anshul Sadana, founder and CEO of Nexthop AI Andy Jassy, president and CEO of Amazon Matt Garman, CEO at AWS Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla George Gilbert, principal analyst at theCUBE Research Mike Speiser, managing director at Sutter Hill Ventures Reid Hoffman, partner at Greylock Partners Charlene Barshefsky, lawyer and former United States Trade Representative Scott Ferrall, American radio personality and host Jim Plummer, electrical engineer from Stanford University David B.

Title: 120 Million Square Feet: Store Closings In The United States Are On Pace To Set A New Record High In 2025

Editor Economy Michael Snyder, The Economic Collapse Blog If everything is going to be just fine, why are thousands of stores closing all over the country? So far this year, the total amount of retail space that has been permanently closed has surpassed 120 million square feet. We have never seen anything like this before. Store closings spiked during the early days of the pandemic, but in 2025 stores are being permanently shuttered at an even faster pace. In fact, during the first six months of this year 5,822 store closures were recorded… Store closures across the U.S. continue to rise, and remain on track to far significantly surpass both new openings and the figures seen in 2024. According to a new report from research and advisory firm Coresight Research, cited by CoStar News, 5,822 store closures were recorded as of June 27, compared to 3,496 closures announced during the same period of 2024. If stores continue to close at this rate, we will break the old record that was established during the pandemic by a wide margin. We are also being told that the total amount of retail space that has been permanently shuttered in 2025 has reached a staggering 120 million square feet… In June, store closings by Plano, Texas-based home goods seller At Home and Philadelphia-based pharmacy chain Rite Aid, which have both filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, “pushed the total amount of retail space to close in the U.S. this year to over 120 million square feet,” Coresight said. The real estate churn is happening “as cyclical impacts confront structural shifts,” according to one executive at the research firm. Wow. You may have noticed that there are an increasing number of abandoned buildings in your particular area. Sadly, this is just the beginning. Consumers are under more financial stress than we have ever seen, and that has resulted in a substantial decline in store traffic… Many of the retail store closures are a result of declining store traffic as more consumers respond to inflation by reducing spending. There also are more consumers turning to online shopping especially for apparel, accessories and household items. The winner is not merely Amazon but increased competition from Temu and Shein marketplaces and social commerce outlets like TikTok. Needless to say, more stores are being closed down with each passing day. After filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Claire’s announced that it will be closing 18 more stores… Claire’s, a mall-based teen accessories retailer, has identified several locations across the country it plans to close after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Claire’s U.S., which operates Claire’s and Icing stores, made the filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware on Wednesday. It’s the second time since 2018 the company has filed for bankruptcy. While the company says the majority of its retail stores will remain open while it “continues to explore all strategic alternatives,” Claire’s said it identified 18 stores ahead of the Aug. 6 bankruptcy filing it would close, filings show. And home goods retailer At Home just announced that it will be closing 6 more stores… The home goods retailer At Home is closing an additional six stores across the country, bringing its total closure tally to more than two dozen as it grapples with high debt and dwindling sales. The furniture and home decor retailer based in Coppell, Texas, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 16, pointing to “broader economic and retail-specific market pressures,” in court documents. The bankruptcy filing and store closures follow several other “big box” retailers that have also significantly downsized their brick-and-mortar footprints this year, including Big Lots, Joann Fabrics, Kohl’s, JCPenney, Macy’s, and Party City. The retailer intially announced 26 store closures in June, before paring that down to 24 when it decided to keep open two stores in New Jersey and Wisconsin. The company added another six stores to the list, according to a statement by retail firm Hilco Consumer-Retail on Aug. 1, bringing the current number of stores it will shutter in the coming months to 30. We see more stories like this every single day. So what is going to happen if our economic momentum continues to take us very rapidly in the wrong direction? Earlier today, we learned that the percentage of student loans entering serious delinquency is absolutely exploding… The total amount of outstanding student loan debt was $1.64 trillion in the second quarter of 2025 after rising by $7 billion in the quarter. Additionally, the share of student loan debt entering serious delinquency, considered 90 days or more late, jumped to 12.9% at the end of June, up from 8% in March and above pre-pandemic trends that were around 9-10% from 2012 into early 2020, when the moratorium initially took effect. The American people are drowning in debt, and I expect delinquency rates of all types to continue to rise in the months ahead. We are going to see more layoffs too, and the fact that continuing claims for unemployment benefits just hit their highest level since 2021 is not a good sign at all… Recurring applications for unemployment benefits surged to the highest since November 2021, adding to recent signs that the labor market is weakening. Continuing claims, a proxy for the number of people receiving benefits, rose by 38,000 to 1.97 million in the week ended July 26, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. On top of everything else, U.S. manufacturing activity is now in contraction territory… From March to July, U.S. manufacturing activity contracted, according to the Institute for Supply Management’s monthly survey. The Manufacturing PMI last registered at 48, below the 50 score that differentiates growth and decline. The effective average tariff rate on all imported goods now stands at around roughly 18% versus 2.3% last year, the highest levels since the 1930s. We are in so much trouble. After evaluating all of the latest economic numbers that have come in, Mark Zandi has come to the conclusion that the “economy is on the precipice of recession”… Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, on Monday wrote a post on X that the “economy is on the precipice of recession” – citing the weaker-than-expected jobs report released Friday and the inflation data from the previous day that showed consumer prices rose as indicating the economy’s precarious position. “Consumer spending has flatlined, construction and manufacturing are contracting, and employment is set to fall. And with inflation on the rise, it is tough for the Fed to come to the rescue,” he wrote. It is hard to argue with him. Of course what is eventually coming is going to be so much worse than just a “recession”. As conditions deteriorate, will store closings slow down or will they speed up? The answer to that question is obvious. If there are stores in your local area that you really enjoy, I would visit them now while you still can, because they might not be there next year.

Title: The new American workplace crisis: Return-to-office mandates lead to a working mom exodus

She was previously an editorial leader at Bankrate, The Points Guy, and Business Insider, and a reporter at Bloomberg News. Ashley is a graduate of Ohio University's Scripps School of Journalism. The historic surge in employment among working mothers seen during the pandemic has reversed sharply in 2025, as new data reveal tens of thousands of American women, especially those with young children, leaving the workforce. According to federal labor statistics analyzed by the Washington Post, the labor force participation rate for women ages 25 to 44 with children under 5 fell nearly three percentage points between January and June 2025, reaching its lowest level in over three years. Fortune’s analysis integrates these workforce shifts with a broader view of corporate America’s changing priorities. Our coverage finds: This pullback follows the widespread rollback of remote and flexible work policies that initially ushered many mothers back to the job market. Major corporations and the federal government have now instituted strict return-to-office mandates, requiring five-days-a-week in-person attendance. For many mothers, the loss of flexibility means a logistical and financial reckoning. JPMorgan Chase, AT&T, and Amazon, among others, ramped up their in-office requirements in 2025, with Fortune reporting that the share of Fortune 500 companies with full-time mandates nearly doubled since late 2024. Employers report difficulty replacing departed female talent, with overall productivity suffering as a result. Compounding these changes are rising childcare costs, closures of childcare centers due to lapsing federal aid, and a noticeable trend toward traditional gender roles. Social media movements like #tradwife encourage women to prioritize home and children, amplified by calls from political leaders for more parents to stay home. For many families facing unaffordable childcare, the decision is an economic necessity rather than a cultural choice. Black women and those with college degrees have been hit especially hard. The unemployment rate for Black women climbed to its highest in nearly four years; federal layoffs and the dismantling of diversity initiatives eliminated stable jobs that disproportionately supported minority women. Experts interviewed by both the Washington Post and Fortune warn that these trends, if left unchecked, will have “huge implications” for women’s lifetime earnings, career prospects, and retirement security. With breaks in employment history, women frequently return to lower-paying jobs and face diminished opportunities for advancement. Studies, including a 2024 University of Pittsburgh analysis, similarly show that aggressive return-to-office mandates have led to a loss of senior employees—many of them women—threatening productivity and competitiveness.

Microsoft reportedly preparing to boost in-office working When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft could be the latest tech giant to explore a stricter in-office working policy, with reports claiming the company is reportedly considering enacting a three-day office-working policy for most employees. Until now, workers have been able to spend around half of their time at home (or away from the office) despite rivals like Amazon enforcing stricter full-time office-working policies. A Microsoft spokesperson told Business Insider the company had been exploring changes to the policy, but no official alterations have been made yet. The report claims an official Microsoft announcement could come as soon as September 2025, with rollout of any changes arriving as soon as January 2026, although dates and indeed policies may vary depending on location. Reports of upcoming changes come after the company has made other changes to its workforce, including ongoing worker readjustments and an updated PIP framework to more quickly exit underperforming workers. In July 2025, Microsoft laid off around 9,000 of its workers, and two months earlier in May a further 6,000 workers lost their jobs. Company CFO Amy Hood told workers in an internal memo (see by Business Insider) that they should prepare for another year of "intensity."

"We're entering FY26 with clear priorities in security, quality, and AI transformation, building on our momentum and grounded in our mission and growth-mindset culture," she added. Although the company has undergone major layoffs in recent months, hiring efforts in other areas and a broader restructuring has seen minimal changes to actual overall headcount. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently said the layoffs had been "weighing heavily" on him, likening the ongoing transformation to that of the 1990s, when PCs and software became democratized, blaming the shifts on evolving customer needs. Microsoft told us that it is looking at refreshing its flexible working guidelines, as it has done many times before. The company has a page dedicated to its flexible work approach, which reads "No 'one size fits all'."

Title: A US senator from Colombia emerges as a Trump link for Latin America’s conservatives
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/08/11/senate-moreno-latin-america/
Time Published: 2025-08-11T16:38:35Z
Full Content:
By JOSHUA GOODMAN and JULIE CARR SMYTH MIAMI (AP) — When Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno visits Colombia this week as part of a three-nation tour of Latin America, it will be something of a homecoming. The Ohio senator, who defeated an incumbent last year with the help of Donald Trump’s endorsement and the highest political ad spending in U.S. Senate race history, was born in Bogota and has brothers who are heavyweights in politics and business there. Moreno has emerged as an interlocutor for conservatives in Latin America seeking to connect with the Trump administration. In an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the trip, he expressed deep concern about Colombia’s direction under left-wing President Gustavo Petro and suggested that U.S. sanctions, higher tariffs or other retaliatory action might be needed to steer it straight. The recent criminal conviction of former President Alvaro Uribe, a conservative icon, was an attempt to “silence” the man who saved Colombia from guerrilla violence, Moreno said. Meanwhile, record cocaine production has left the United States less secure — and Colombia vulnerable to being decertified by the White House for failing to cooperate in the war on drugs. “The purpose of the trip is to understand all the dynamics before any decision is made,” said Moreno, who will meet with both Petro and Uribe, as well as business leaders and local officials. “But there’s nothing that’s taken off the table at this point and there’s nothing that’s directly being contemplated.” Moreno, a luxury car dealer from Cleveland, defeated incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown last year and became Ohio’s senior senator on practically his first day in office after his close friend JD Vance resigned the Senate to become vice president. In Congress, Moreno has mimicked Trump’s rhetoric to attack top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer as a “miserable old man out of a Dickens novel,” called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and threatened to subpoena California officials over their response to anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. On Latin America, he’s been similarly outspoken, slamming Petro on social media as a “socialist dictator” and accusing Mexico of being on the path to becoming a “narco state.” Such comments barely register in blue-collar Ohio, but they’ve garnered attention in Latin America. That despite the fact Moreno hasn’t lived in the region for decades, speaks Spanish with a U.S. accent and doesn’t sit on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “He’s somebody to watch,” said Michael Shifter, the former president of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. “He’s one of the most loyal Trump supporters in the senate and given his background in Latin America he could be influential on policy.” Moreno, 58, starts his first congressional delegation to Latin America on Monday for two days of meetings in Mexico City with officials including President Claudia Sheinbaum. He’ll be accompanied by Terrance Cole, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, who is making his first overseas trip since being confirmed by the Senate last month to head the premier federal narcotics agency. Moreno, in the pre-trip interview, said that Sheinbaum has done more to combat the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. than her predecessor and mentor Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who he described as a “total disaster.” But he said more cooperation is needed, and he’d like to see Mexico allow the DEA to participate in judicial wiretaps like it has for decades in Colombia and allow it to bring back a plane used in bilateral investigations that López Obrador grounded. “The corruption becomes so pervasive, that if it’s left unchecked, it’s kind of like treating cancer,” said Moreno. “Mexico has to just come to the realization that it does not have the resources to completely wipe out the drug cartels. And it’s only going to be by asking the U.S. for help that we can actually accomplish that.” From Mexico, Moreno heads to Panama, where he’ll tour the Panama Canal with Trump’s new ambassador to the country, Kevin Marino Cabrera. In March, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate struck a deal that would’ve handed control of two ports on either end of the U.S.-built canal to American investment firm BlackRock Inc. The deal was heralded by Trump, who had threatened to take back the canal to curb Chinese influence. However, the deal has since drawn scrutiny from antitrust authorities in Beijing and last month the seller said it was seeking to add a strategic partner from mainland China — reportedly state-owned shipping company Cosco — to the deal. “Cosco you might as well say is the actual communist party,” said Moreno. “There’s no scenario in which Cosco can be part of the Panamanian ports.” On the final leg of the tour in Colombia, Moreno will be joined by another Colombian American senator: Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona. In contrast to Moreno, who was born into privilege and counts among his siblings a former ambassador to the U.S., Gallego and his three sisters were raised by an immigrant single mother on a secretary’s paycheck. Despite their different upbringings, the two have made common cause in seeking to uphold the tradition of bilateral U.S. support for Colombia, for decades Washington’s staunchest ally in the region. It’s a task made harder by deepening polarization in both countries. The recent sentencing of Uribe to 12 years of house arrest in a long-running witness tampering case has jolted the nation’s politics with nine months to go before decisive presidential elections. The former president is barred from running but remains a powerful leader, and Moreno said his absence from the campaign trail could alter the playing field. He also worries that surging cocaine production could once again lead to a “narcotization” of a bilateral relationship that should be about trade, investment and mutual prosperity. “We want Colombia to be strong, we want Colombia to be healthy, we want Colombia to be prosperous and secure, and I think the people of Colombia want the exact same thing,” he added. “So, the question is, how do we get there?” Smyth reported from Columbus, Ohio.

Title: Ethereum Bullish Fundamentals Clash With Short-Term Leverage Risks

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum reached multi-year highs, breaking decisively above the $4,300 level after several days of strong bullish momentum. This breakout marks Ethereum’s highest level since late 2021, fueled by growing institutional demand, ETF inflows, and expanding on-chain activity. However, fresh market data from CryptoQuant suggests that caution may be warranted in the short term. The all-exchange Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR) has climbed to 0.68, approaching historical highs and signaling excessive market-wide leverage. While Binance’s ELR sits lower at 0.52, indicating more measured positioning on the world’s largest exchange, higher relative leverage on other platforms points to elevated speculative activity elsewhere. Ethereum’s price is currently testing a critical resistance zone between $4,020 and $4,060—a historically pivotal area that has often determined whether a rally accelerates or faces a sharp pullback. Adding to the short-term risk profile, Binance netflows have spiked significantly above the all-exchange average, suggesting concentrated inflows that may lead to localized sell pressure, possibly linked to liquidations or arbitrage-driven trades. According to Crypto Onchain, a CryptoQuant analyst, Ethereum’s mid-term fundamentals remain strongly bullish despite short-term caution signals. Institutional demand is surging, with US Spot Ethereum ETFs recording a record $726.6 million in daily net inflows, driven by giants like BlackRock and Fidelity. This has pushed total ETF holdings above 5 million ETH (valued at approximately $20.3 billion), a milestone that underscores Ethereum’s growing role in institutional portfolios. Beyond ETFs, major players are increasing direct exposure. Ark Invest purchased 30,755 ETH worth $108.57 million, while Fundamental Global allocated $200 million to ETH as part of its treasury strategy. This wave of accumulation reflects deepening confidence in Ethereum’s long-term utility and value proposition. On-chain metrics also paint a bullish picture. Transaction volumes are hitting new highs, and staking participation continues to expand, locking up more ETH and reducing circulating supply. Regulatory clarity—such as the SEC closing investigations into liquid staking—has further strengthened structural demand for ETH. Upcoming network upgrades, including Pectra and Fusaka, are set to boost scalability and lower costs. This will enhance Ethereum’s appeal to both developers and enterprises. In the short term, high leverage, key resistance levels, and concentrated exchange inflows pose a risk of sharp volatility. However, the mid-term outlook remains intact, supported by sustained institutional inflows, robust network growth, and technological advancements. Even if near-term corrections occur, these factors should help cap downside pressure and maintain Ethereum’s broader bullish trajectory. Ethereum’s 4-hour chart shows a strong breakout above the key resistance at $3,860, which had capped price action in late July. Following this decisive move, ETH surged past the $4,300 level, marking its highest point since November 2021. This rally was supported by strong bullish momentum, as seen in the steep incline of the 50-period SMA (blue) and the price holding well above the 100-period (green) and 200-period (red) SMAs. Currently, ETH is consolidating just below its recent peak, around $4,240, signaling a potential pause before the next move. This consolidation at elevated levels, rather than a sharp retracement, suggests that bulls remain in control. The $3,860–$3,900 zone now acts as a critical support, and a retest could provide a healthy setup for continuation. Volume spikes during the breakout indicate strong buying interest, but the reduced volume in the latest candles suggests the market is waiting for fresh catalysts. A sustained move above $4,300 could open the door toward the $4,450–$4,500 zone, while a breakdown below $3,860 would weaken the bullish structure.

Despite years of promises from tech leaders about lucrative coding careers, recent computer science graduates are facing a challenging job market due to the rise of AI programming tools and widespread layoffs in the tech industry. Some are taking jobs at fast food restaurants while they plan their next move. The New York Times reports that the allure of high-paying tech jobs has driven a surge in computer science education over the past decade, with the number of undergraduates majoring in the field more than doubling since 2014. Tech executives have long touted coding skills as a golden ticket to economic success, promising six-figure starting salaries and generous perks to those who pursue computer science degrees. However, the reality for many recent graduates is far less rosy. The spread of AI programming tools that can rapidly generate code, combined with significant layoffs at major tech companies like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, has dimmed prospects for those seeking entry-level positions in the industry. Among college graduates aged 22 to 27, computer science and computer engineering majors are facing some of the highest unemployment rates at 6.1 percent and 7.5 percent respectively — more than double the rate for biology and art history graduates. As Breitbart News has previously reported, another factor impacting the hire of new grads at tech companies is the influx of H-1B visa workers from India and China even as the companies lay off American workers: According to data compiled by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, Microsoft has applied for 4,712 H-1B visas in the 2025 fiscal year alone. However, anecdotal evidence from former employees and industry insiders suggests that the actual number may be closer to 6,000, although this figure has not been independently verified. The use of H-1B visas by large corporations has long been a contentious issue, with critics arguing that they allow companies to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor. Supporters of the program, however, maintain that it enables businesses to attract top talent from around the world and remain competitive in a global marketplace. Microsoft’s history of H-1B visa applications aligns with this perspective, as the company filed 9,491 applications in the 2024 fiscal year, with nearly all of them being approved. In response to questions from the Times, more than 150 college students and recent graduates from state schools including the universities of Maryland, Texas and Washington, as well as private universities like Cornell and Stanford, shared their experiences trying to get a job. Some claim to have applied to hundreds, and in some cases thousands, of tech jobs at companies, nonprofits and government agencies. Graduates from prestigious universities and state schools alike report facing a grueling process of coding assessments, technical interviews, and ultimately, rejection. Many describe the job search experience as “demoralizing,” “disheartening,” and “soul-crushing,” with some feeling “gaslit” by the tech industry about their career prospects. Some recent grads have even resorted to taking fast food jobs to generate income as they continue to pursue a career aligned with their major. One respondent said Chipotle was the only company that actually replied to her application, while another was rejected by McDonald’s for lacking experience. The rise of AI coding assistants is a particular concern for the students, as these tools reduce the need for companies to hire junior software engineers. Entry-level positions are now the most likely to be automated, leaving new graduates struggling to find a foothold in the industry. Additionally, many universities are just beginning to train students on these cutting-edge AI tools, putting recent graduates at a disadvantage. Job seekers feel they are caught in an AI “doom loop,” using specialized tools to mass-apply to positions while companies deploy AI systems to automatically screen resumes and reject candidates. Even government tech jobs, once seen as a stable alternative, have become more difficult to secure due to cutbacks and hiring freezes. As the job market shifts, some graduates are pivoting to other areas of the tech industry, such as marketing and sales, or highlighting their uniquely human skills like creativity. Others remain determined to pursue software engineering roles, building personal projects to showcase their abilities to potential employers. Read more at the New York Times here.

Title: Ford to build EV pickup with a starting price of $30K in bid to catch China rivals

Ford plans to start rolling out its new family of affordable electric vehicles in 2027, including a midsize pickup truck with a target starting price of $30,000, the company said on Monday, as it aspires to the cost efficiency of Chinese rivals. The new midsize four-door pickup will be assembled at the automaker’s Louisville, Ky., plant. Ford is investing nearly $2 billion in the plant, which produces the Escape and Lincoln Corsair, retaining at least 2,200 jobs, it said in a statement. Chinese carmakers such as BYD have streamlined their supply chain and production system to produce EVs at a fraction of the cost of Western automakers. While these vehicles have yet to enter the US market, Ford CEO Jim Farley said they set a new standard that companies like Ford must match. “I can’t tell you with 100% certainty that this will all go just right,” Farley told a crowd at Ford’s Louisville assembly plant on Monday, noting that past efforts by US automakers to build affordable cars had fizzled. “It is a bet. There is risk.” Ford has been developing its affordable EVs through its so-called skunkworks team, filled with talent from EV rivals Tesla and Rivian. The California-based group, led by former Tesla executive Alan Clarke, has set itself so much apart from the larger Ford enterprise that Farley said even his badge could not get him into its building for some time. EVs sold for an average of about $47,000 in June, J.D. Power data showed. Many Chinese models sell for $10,000 to $25,000. Affordability is a top concern among EV shoppers, auto executives have said, and the global competition for delivering cheaper electric models is heating up. EV startup Slate, backed by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, is aiming for a starting price in the mid-$20,000s for its electric pickup. Tesla has teased a cheaper model, with production ramping up later this year. Rivian and Lucid are also planning to roll out lower-priced models for their lineups, although price points are in the $40,000s to $50,000s. Since rolling out plans earlier this decade to push hard into EVs, Ford has pulled back as the losses piled up. It has scaled back many of its EV goals, canceled an electric three-row SUV, and axed a program to develop a more advanced electrical architecture for future models. Ford last year announced it would start building its midsize truck from the skunkworks team in 2027. The automaker earlier this year estimated losing up to $5.5 billion on its EV and software division. It lost nearly $10 billion combined on those operations from 2023 to 2024. Cutting costs on battery-powered models has been one of the primary goals of Farley, who has said he expects this new family of EVs to be profitable within one year. Ford sells three EVs in the US: the Mustang Mach-E SUV, E-Transit van, and F-150 Lightning pickup. Sales of those vehicles fell 12% in the first half from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, interest in hybrids has surged, with sales up 27% over the same window. Ford recently pushed back production of its next-generation F-150 Lightning and E-Transit to 2028. The elimination of a $7,500 consumer tax credit, loosening regulations on emissions and reduced funding for charging infrastructure are expected to further dampen demand. All this makes it more important for automakers to pick their lanes, Farley has said. “The pure EV market in the US seems to us very clear: small vehicles used for commuting and around town,” Farley told analysts on an earnings call last month. By contrast, crosstown rival General Motors has electrified vehicles across its entire lineup, from the hulking Hummer to the smaller Equinox SUV. GM spent more time upfront building a ground-up platform as a base for its EV models. Meanwhile, Ford has reconfigured many of its popular gasoline-powered vehicles with batteries to get to market sooner, delaying the development and launch of a unified EV platform, details of which it unveiled on Monday. While being out front has exposed Ford to more EV demand fluctuations over the past two years, it has also learned more about the market, Farley has said. Ford is using lithium-iron-phosphate, or LFP batteries, for the forthcoming family of EVs. The batteries are produced in Marshall, Mich., using technology from Chinese EV-battery maker CATL that has helped to bring down the sticker price of electric cars. Advertisement

Title: Trump is calling Wall Street’s bluff on tariffs | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Wall Street traders embraced the term TACO — Trump always chickens out — earlier this year to describe President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again position on tariffs. Trump liked to impose hefty import taxes but would inevitably back off when markets plunged, analysts said. Now Trump is calling the market’s bluff. Yet another round of new tariffs went effect on Thursday, lifting the average tax on US imports to the highest level since the 1930s. Trump bet markets would absorb this latest news, adapt and move on — and so far he appears to have been right. Stocks still closed higher on the week, with the Nasdaq hitting a record high on Friday and the S&P 500 notching its best week in over one month. It’s a remarkable shift from early April, when the president’s “Liberation Day” tariffs caused stocks across the globe to plunge. But with economists saying tariff effects could take weeks or months to play out, it’s too soon to declare victory just yet. “He is succeeding in implementing major tariffs without shocking the stock market,” said Ethan Harris, former head of global economics at Bank of America. “It’s surprising, and you could call it an accomplishment if you’re in favor of tariffs.” Trump may be winning the hand, but Wall Street has lots of cards left. The game isn’t over. Investors in recent months have embraced the “TACO” trade. A better description would be, “Trump always tries again,” according to Harris. With the latest import taxes, Trump is pushing forward with an average tariff rate just slightly slower than what he tried to impose on April 2, according to the Budget Lab at Yale. While stocks are hovering near record highs, Harris said he expects tariffs will inflict “real damage” on the economy, and it remains to be seen if investors will stay complacent. The inclusion of carveouts has softened the blow of tariffs, according to Kurt Reiman, head of fixed income at UBS. That has helped temper investors’ concerns. Apple (AAPL), for example, is exempt from tariffs on some imports from India and tariffs on semiconductors because of its pledge to develop production in the United States. Apple stock last week soared 13% and had its best week since 2020. “The tariff wall being built by the administration also has many holes because of numerous product exemptions, carveouts and delayed implementation dates,” Reiman said. Enthusiasm about the AI boom in the United States is also driving market momentum and drawing attention away from tariffs. While investors have been concerned about trade, blowout earnings from big tech companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta (META) have helped buoy the market. In addition, trading partners have largely not retaliated, avoiding a global trade war that would have had worse outcomes for the US economy, according to David Doyle, head of economics at Macquarie. “What’s really struck me is how little Trump has had to chicken out from,” Robert Armstrong, the Financial Times columnist who coined the term “TACO,” told CNN’s Richard Quest in an August 1 interview. Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility index, spiked in early April above 50 points — a historic level not seen since the Covid pandemic or the 2008 financial crisis. The VIX in August just briefly breached 20 points — a level associated with slightly noticeable volatility — before retreating. Investors are maintaining faith in a “Trump put,” or the notion that if the markets do plummet, the president will refine his approach. The “Trump put” is different from chickening out, analysts say, as the president might back down just enough to satisfy markets before pushing forward again with his tariffs when he is able to. “He always tries again until the equity market punishes the policy,” Harris said. “That’s the old ‘Trump put’ idea, which is the way people used to talk about it, and is still the correct way to think about the trade war.” While Trump has implemented his tariffs, it might be too soon to call victory. Investors are awaiting data on inflation and the labor market in upcoming months to get a better sense of how tariffs are impacting the economy. “As an investor, you can talk yourself into not worrying about tariffs, but if you’re a company trying to make business plans, you can’t afford to ignore the tariffs,” Harris said. “The stock market and the economy are not the same thing.” Arun Sai, senior multi-asset strategist at Pictet Asset Management, said investors are taking two leaps of faith in believing in the resilience of the US economy and that “the stagflationary impulse of tariffs” — slower growth and stickier inflation — won’t be as bad as initially feared. Markets are a “little too complacent,” Sai said, and he will be watching the next two inflation reports ahead of the Federal Reserve’s September policy meeting for any sign of tariff-induced increases in prices. “By no means are we out of the woods,” Sai said. “ We are priced for nothing to go wrong, and yet we still have a very important inflection point ahead of us.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Advertisement August 11, 2025 | 7 min read Listen to article 4 min Barry Dudley of Green Square dissects the fledgling talks between S4 Capital and MSQ Partners, exploring strategic fit, the market forces driving the potential deal and what it could mean for Sir Martin Sorrell’s “new-age” marketing group after a turbulent few years. Sir Martin Sorrell founded S4 Capital in 2018 after leaving WPP S4 Capital, Sir Martin Sorrell’s ‘new-age’ digital marketing group, has confirmed that it is in very preliminary deal talks with MSQ Partners, the creative and technology agency network that is majority-owned by US private equity firm One Equity Partners (OEP). The potential deal – which S4 says would be structured as an acquisition of MSQ by S4 Capital rather than a takeover of S4 – comes after a bruising period for the group. S4’s share price has fallen more than 90% from its peak only a few years ago. The current market capitalization sits at around £140m, a fraction of the multibillion pound valuation it once enjoyed. I’ve heard rumors and seen reports of other interested parties in the past, including the likes of Stagwell, New Mountain Capital and Accenture. I suspect Sir Martin has had many conversations come at him, or indeed he has sought them. Probably even more are incoming right now. S4 Capital was founded in 2018 after Sorrell’s high-profile exit from WPP. Built on aggressive M&A, it focused on digital content production, programmatic advertising and data-driven marketing through acquisitions such as MediaMonks and MightyHive. Its client base reads like a tech-sector who’s-who: Alphabet, Amazon, Meta to name just a few. However, that narrow tech focus has been a double-edged sword. When the sector tightened budgets and many reallocated spend towards AI investments, S4’s revenues took a hit – compounded by accounting missteps, economic headwinds and rising interest rates. MSQ Partners, on the other hand, offers a broader spread of clients – more than 250, including Unilever, Haleon, Lego, P&G and Booking.com – across consumer goods, healthcare, financial services and B2B. It operates through a decentralized network of specialist agencies spanning advertising, PR, design, digital, and tech. Since being acquired by OEP in 2023, MSQ has invested in integrated, creative-plus-tech delivery models. We recently advised Precious Media, a connected commerce digital agency, on its sale to MSQ. So how could they fit: Complementary client bases – S4 is over-indexed to tech; MSQ brings balance through FMCG, healthcare, and finance. Capability cross-sell – MSQ’s creative brand-building could bolster S4’s digital execution; S4’s programmatic and data expertise could sharpen MSQ’s digital performance offering. Geographic scale – S4’s US and APAC strength could mesh with MSQ’s European roots, giving a broader footprint without heavy duplication. AI positioning – Both have leaned into AI narratives, but a combined group could pool their R&D resources. Advertisement The marketing services sector is undergoing its biggest structural shift since the holding-company era of the 80s and 90s. AI is reshaping creative workflows, media buying and data analytics. Clients are consolidating their agency rosters, looking for faster, integrated delivery. The network groups have been re-engineering their own businesses to face this new way of working, with WPP recently merging its media offer under one brand. All are focussed on, and investing in, AI to help them deliver across media, creative and processes. But these are big legacy firms… and big ships can find it notoriously difficult to change course quickly. This has created fertile ground for private equity–backed roll-ups and mergers of complementary mid-scale networks. We’ve seen a plethora of PE firms coming into the market and appetite isn’t abating. For OEP, combining MSQ with S4 could create another top-tier independent rival, not only to snap at the heels of the mega groups, but also some of the smaller challenger brands and the other PE-backed indies. It could also give MSQ more muscle in terms of its own future expansion, both geographically and in terms of capability infills it may need. Advertisement Will OEP take it off the stock market? I suspect it will, not least because it removes that historical peak – which was arguably a significant over-valuation – which will otherwise be a benchmark that continues to be referenced under the current listing. That said, maintaining the listing could open up other options in terms of financing future acquisitions. And where will Sir Martin end up if this goes through? His voting control and personal stake mean no deal happens without him seeing a clear path for himself. Wherever things go, he looks set for another defining chapter in his career. Or will he head for the beach, which is where I am right now… Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.

Title: BlackRock Addresses Burning XRP ETF Question: Is A Filing Coming Or Not?
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/blackrock-on-xrp-etf-question/
Time Published: 2025-08-11T12:00:21Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, has broken its silence on whether it intends to file for an XRP ETF. This follows months of speculation that the firm could soon file to offer this fund. A BlackRock spokesperson told The Block that they have no plans to file for an XRP ETF at this time. This ends speculations that it will join eight other asset managers who have already filed to offer this fund. The world’s largest asset manager already offers Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, and based on the statement, the firm plans to stick with only the two largest crypto assets. NovaDius Wealth President Nate Geraci was one of those who had speculated that BlackRock was going to file for an XRP ETF soon. Prior to the asset manager’s statement, Geraci opined that the firm was waiting for the Ripple SEC lawsuit to end before filing for an iShares XRP ETF. He made this prediction following Ripple and the SEC’s filing of a joint dismissal to end the XRP lawsuit. Geraci further remarked that it makes “zero” sense for BlackRock to ignore crypto assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. He added that if they do that, they are basically saying that BTC and ETH are the only crypto assets that will ever have value. Following BlackRock’s statement, the NovaDius Wealth president said that the firm’s decision not to file for an XRP ETF will be looked on as a mistake. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas also weighed in on BlackRock’s decision not to file for an XRP ETF. He asked Geraci if an XRP filing is enough or if he feels the world’s largest asset manager should also file for SOL, Tron ETFs. He further questioned where exactly the line should be drawn on how many crypto ETFs asset managers should offer. Nate Geraci believes that there will be significant demand for the XRP ETFs, which is one reason why he thinks BlackRock is making a mistake by not filing for one. He noted that futures-based XRP funds have taken in over $1 billion since their launch this year. He opined that this proves that there will be “real” demand for the spot funds. Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton is confident that BlackRock will still file for an XRP ETF. He said that he is willing to bet that this happens within a year. BlackRock’s failure to file for this ETF now and opt to do so later could prove costly since the pending applications could have the first-mover advantage. According to Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, there is a 95% chance that the SEC approves these funds this year. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $3.26, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Title: I'm Worried It Might Get Really Bad
URL: https://danielmiessler.com/blog/im-worried-it-might-get-bad
Time Published: 2025-08-11T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
I'm starting to worry things might get very bad, very soon. Not like in a year or two, but maybe in a few months. As in spontaneous recession type of thing. In the US mostly, but perhaps globally. It sounds irrational to me as well as I think it or type it. But I can't shake the feeling, so I want to try to write it all down to see how rational it looks on paper. In no real order, here are the various things I'm stressing about. These are people who've been making over $100-200K in tech or tech-adjacent for over a decade. And they can't find work. I mean they can barely get interviews. And when I say a ton, I mean multiple dozen that I either know or I'm one degree separated from. And again, these are not low-skill people. They're legit professionals that have never in their life had trouble finding or maintaining work. Google has said this. Amazon. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff explicitly stated the company won't hire any new software engineers in 2025, citing AI-driven productivity gains. We don't even really have to believe them, because we're seeing tons of actual layoffs at the same time. Microsoft laid off 15,000+ employees in 2025, about 7% of its workforce, explicitly tied to AI investments Intel cut 15,000 jobs, Tesla laid off 14,000, and Cisco cut 10,000 in 2024 It actually goes much further back, and it's no-doubt multi-causal. We had the pandemic. We had over-hiring. We've heard all the arguments for what it could be. Tech layoffs by year: 549 companies laid off more than 150,000 employees in 2024, and we're already at 69,672 layoffs in 2025 as of July 31st. The tech unemployment rate sits at 3.4%, but that doesn't capture the full picture of experienced professionals unable to find work. Hundreds or thousands of companies, and billions of dollars, are being spent on replacing human workers. Some don't think this is possible, but they think we need to invent some super smart model that's better than anything we've ever seen. We don't need that. What we need is scaffolding and piping that connects the dots and brings the right context together in the right way to solve problem x or y. This is not as difficult as it seems, and I already have a ton of the precursors of this working, and I'm just one person. Now imagine billions of dollars and tens of thousands of people working on it. Salesforce says AI bots now do 50% of the company's work. They're pushing what they call a "digital workforce" where AI agents handle customer service, sales, and even coding tasks. Microsoft reports that 30% of software coding work is already done by AI. These aren't future promises - this is happening right now. And the prize they're chasing is worth the cost, because it means saving millions upon millions in hiring costs, payroll, health insurance, and all manner of employee-related complications in every business everywhere. Getting rid of human work forces is a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity for the companies that get part of that pie. And they're spending on the R&D accordingly. There's a frequent counter-argument to the AI taking human jobs that goes something like this: Yeah, AI might be able to do the job at a basic level, but humans are dynamic and creative! We can use our innovation and brilliance to do things way better than AI! This is, of course, true. For some workers. Some of the time. But—by definition—most workers are not exceptional. Most workers, and most work days, are just drudgery. Answering emails. Writing up quarterly plans. Reviewing metrics. Building applications that do something with data. A very large number of people dread Monday, and that's not because they show up Monday morning and bring all their creativity and brilliance. It's because it's clocking in and clocking out on a job they'd rather not be doing. These are prime targets for AI replacement. And they are not the fringe. This isn't the bottom 5% of the workforce. This is the bottom 60-80%! In other words, my read is that the replacement of jobs by AI isn't coming for the bottom few percent. It's coming for all but the top few percent. Not all at once, of course, that will take years, but I think it's already started. Another thing I wonder about is I see how expensive everything is and I know what the average salary / working wage is. I can't help but wonder, how the hell are restaurants so full? How is it that people are still going to the movies, eating out, and buying stuff at all the different shops? I'm concerned the answer might be that many are just putting everything on credit cards. And the data points in that direction. We Americans now have $1.21 trillion in total credit card debt as of Q4 2024, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That's up 57% from the pandemic low of $770 billion in early 2021. But what hits even harder is the average per household. The average American household now carries $10,668 in credit card debt, with average interest rates at 22.25% as of Q2 2025. That's over $2,300 per year just in interest payments. What's even more concerning is that approximately 9.1% of credit card balances have transitioned into delinquency over the last year. People are maxing out their cards and then struggling to make even minimum payments. Nearly half (46%) of American households are carrying credit card debt, and for many, it's becoming unsustainable. So yes, the restaurants are full and the shops are busy, but it's increasingly being funded by high-interest debt that people can't actually afford. Then we have the macro situation. I make decent money and every single day I'm like: How the fuck did I just pay $20 for a burger and a Diet Coke? And it's just everything. On a given day I might use a few different services, eat out a couple of times, and suddenly I've spent $100 when that would have been like $40 or $50 dollars a few years ago. Putting me aside, I look around at everyone around me and I'm like, how in the hell is anyone affording this? And every indication points to prices going even higher as a result of the tariffs. Economists predict tariffs will raise consumer prices by 2.3% in the short-run, equivalent to an average $3,800 loss per household. Morgan Stanley expects inflation to hit 2.5% in 2025, up from their previous forecast. Goldman Sachs projects core inflation could reach 3%. I just don't know how much more we can take before something snaps. And this is what I'm actually concerned about. It's not one of these things. Or two of them. Or ten. It's the fact that many of them are happening at the same time. It's the fact that they can affect and magnify each other and become something much bigger. These are the types of scenarios I'm worried about. Like I said, I don't think any one of these would be that bad. And I generally understand that it's hard to cause a recession just all of a sudden. Everything takes time, and there are natural balances to big movements in economic health. The problem is several of these are either likely or are already in progress. And that doesn't even include all the smaller compounding factors above. I think there are many things happening right now—or that could happen soon—that could combine to create a narrative of panic in a population that's just barely holding on. I just don't know what the country does if some significant percentage of our 100 million knowledge workers get laid off because of AI, which causes them to stop spending in the stores, canceling their services, which causes businesses to fail, which causes people to put even more on credit cards, which they can't pay back, which means people can't pay rent and mortgages, which might be someone else's income, etc... It's a cascade. I'm especially worried about the trigger being an extraordinary spike in knowledge worker unemployment in the next 2-18 months, which triggers evictions, worker Visa cancellations, foreclosures, a general blaming/targeting/fear of AI, which closes businesses, gets more people laid off, causes governments to overreact with legislation, etc. All of which culminates in a general nationwide panic. Again, not directly. The economy is quite resilient. I'm saying that these things can combine and multiply each other during a particular news cycle, or particular set of financial results, or job numbers, or whatever—which gets people talking on social media that turns into a narrative. Which will then cause a panic. And I think that leads to calls for one or more of the following: I'm not overly confident / worried that this will happen. It's just a really bad feeling. Maybe like 60%. Using the CIA levels for predictions, I'd put this one at: I hate not having a solution when I present problems, but I've talked about Human 3.0 and everything I recommend for becoming resilient / antifragile in a million other posts. I honestly think this is a bit beyond those if it happens and it's as big as I think it could be. You can't be too resilient (without a farm/bunker) if the basic society / economy is broken for a bit. My best advice right now is honestly—not trying to scare people—just to look around and appreciate what we/you have right now. Because if this happens, right now are the good ol' days. Let's hope I'm wrong, and that this pressure gets released some other way. Thanks to Sasa Zdjelar for talking through this with me. AIL 2 - Daniel wrote the post.

Is water in Sweden really 25 times more valuable than water in Mauritania? Is water in Sweden really 25 times more valuable than water in Mauritania? By Andrew A. King, Ken Pucker & Jesse Colman Aug. 11, 2025 Impact accounting is the heir apparent to ESG (environmental, social, governance) accounting and investing. Where ESG investing emphasizes risks to the firm, impact accounting measures how corporate actions help or harm people and the planet. Its advocates predict impact accounting will engender a more transparent, responsible, and sustainable capitalism. Sir Ronald Cohen (a financier and leading advocate of impact accounting) and Professor George Serafeim (head of Harvard’s Impact Weighted Accounts Initiative) claim it will “redefine success, so that its measure is not just money, but the positive impact we make during our lives.” Impact accounting has attracted influential advocates. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva describes it as “a blueprint for a hope-filled future,” while former SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee contends it could “ensure that those who want to make an impact will make an impact where it matters most.” Leading corporations have begun adopting impact accounting frameworks: BlackRock, Target, and Eisai have pilot-tested methodologies developed at Harvard University, while Kering—the parent company of Gucci—has created its own proprietary system for dollarizing environmental impact. But impact accounting has a dark side that makes its use dangerous. In a previous SSIR article, “Heroic Accounting,” we reviewed the potential for miscalculation and misuse of impact accounting measures. We also highlighted concerns about the feasibility and the perils of centralized, subjective pricing of externalities. There is another important problem we overlooked in that review: Impact accounting has an equity problem, because practical means for calculating impacts discriminate against poor people. This flaw is challenging to correct because it emanates from impact accounting’s core premise: that social and environmental effects can and should be priced and compared in global monetary terms. One recent example illustrates this defect in particularly stark terms. Are you enjoying this article? Read more like this, plus SSIR's full archive of content, when you subscribe. Evidence of the discriminatory tendencies inherent in impact accounting appears in a recent report by the International Foundation for Valuing Impacts (IFVI)—an organization co-founded by Sir Ronald Cohen and Tracy Palandjian (Co-founder and CEO of Social Finance). The report estimates the social cost of consuming fresh water—a resource of growing global concern—for each country. Strikingly, the IFVI assigns the lowest social cost to Mauritania, a desert nation identified by the World Resources Institute (WRI) as facing an “extremely high” risk of future water scarcity. According to the IFVI, consuming a cubic meter of groundwater in Mauritania causes only $0.13 in social harm. In contrast, Sweden—rated by the WRI as having a "low" water risk—is estimated to suffer $3.23 in social harm per cubic meter of groundwater consumed, nearly 25 times the estimate for Mauritania. These counterintuitive estimates are part of a general trend. The IFVI estimates a low cost of water consumption for other water-scarce nations, including Somalia ($0.27/m³) and South Sudan ($0.53/m³), but calculates a much higher social cost in some countries with abundant water resources. Even rain-soaked Ireland is assigned a higher social cost of water consumption ($0.74 /m3) than Mauritania, Somalia, or South Sudan. Why does the IFVI assess Mauritania, Somalia, and South Sudan as places where consuming fresh water causes minimal social harm? The answer appears to lie in their poverty. In these nations, water is primarily used to produce basic goods for local consumption, which are then sold at low prices. The IFVI’s methodology assumes that low prices reflect low social value, and consequently, it concludes that little harm is caused by sacrificing this production to divert water to other uses. By contrast, in wealthy countries like Sweden and Ireland, water is often used to produce higher-priced goods, including luxury items destined for global markets. The higher market prices of these goods are interpreted by the IFVI as indicators of higher social value, leading to greater estimated harm from water consumption. As shown in Figure 1, all countries assigned low social costs for water use by the IFVI are among the world’s poorest, while rich countries—even those with abundant water resources, such as Sweden, Ireland, and Canada—are assigned significantly higher costs. The IFVI's discriminatory estimates are not caused by a bug or error; they are an inevitable consequence of impact accounting's reason for being—the monetization of social impacts expressed in terms of a global unit of exchange. Monetization makes risky assumptions about the relationship between social value and its monetary expression—price. As scholars Garry Jacobs and Ivo Šlaus (2010) warned, "The temptation to measure all value in terms of price plays havoc with commonsense, reason, and human values." In the case of impact accounting, this temptation results in systematic bias against poor people. In Mauritania, consuming water displaces activities such as subsistence agriculture, which the IFVI methodology interprets as causing minimal social harm, even though these activities are essential for survival. Conversely, in Sweden, water extraction displaces high-priced uses like decorative landscaping and is thus mistakenly assigned higher social value despite its lower importance. As a result, impact accounting risks reinforcing global inequalities under the guise of objectivity. Sir Ronald Cohen argues “We have to be able to measure a company's performance in delivering impacts as well as profits.” But how should impact be measured? In financial accounting, price serves as a valid proxy: Managers aim to minimize the prices paid to suppliers and maximize the prices received from customers. Profit, then, reflects how effectively a firm achieves these goals. The same logic does not hold when measuring impact. Market prices do not reliably capture social and environmental outcomes and relying on price as a stand-in for value can lead to severe distortions. Consider a manager overseeing identical facilities in Sweden and Mauritania who must decide where to invest to reduce the social impact of lost work. The manager’s employees require proficiency in mathematics—and thus earn wages comparable to local math teachers: approximately $57,600 per year in Sweden and $5,000 in Mauritania. Following the IFVI’s approach, the social value of lost work is calculated as the product of wage and time, and by this logic, losing a Swedish worker imposes more than ten times the social harm of losing a Mauritanian one. Consequently, to reduce the firm’s measured impact the manager should invest much more money to reduce lost work in Sweden than in Mauritania. But this conclusion is irrational. Higher wages in Sweden reflect the country’s robust institutions and strong economy, not a greater intrinsic value of worker labor. In contrast, Mauritania’s low wages result in large part from weak governance and systemic corruption, which suppresses economic opportunity and distorts labor markets. A 2023 report estimates that at least 3 percent of Mauritanians are paid nothing at all: They are enslaved. By the IFVI’s method, their work provides no social value! The connection between good government and economic development is well established in the economics literature. “Inclusive political institutions that distribute power broadly in society and are accompanied by inclusive economic institutions create the incentives and opportunities that make a nation prosperous,” write Nobel Laureates Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson in their 2012 book, Why Nations Fail. “Institutions that lack inclusivity—where political and economic power are concentrated—tend to reproduce themselves, creating a vicious circle of deprivation and underdevelopment.” Accordingly, it is not a lack of social impact that causes a Mauritanian worker to receive a salary one-tenth the size of his Swedish counterpart; it is a consequence of his working in Mauritania. Proponents of impact accounting shrug their shoulders at such concerns and respond that any accounting of social costs, even if done inaccurately, is better than no accounting at all. For example, Sir Ronald Cohen writes, “Until now, the prevailing view has been that impact cannot be measured reliably enough to be truly useful, however, in John Maynard Keynes's words, ‘It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.’” Unfortunately, inaccurate information can be worse than no information at all. Impact information that directs harm to the poor and dispossessed will cause a decline in social welfare, not an increase, because income has a declining marginal influence on welfare. Depriving $1000 in income to a person in Mauritania, where the average income is $2200, may cause them to have trouble surviving. Deprive that same amount to a person in Sweden, where the average income is 22 times higher, and they may not even notice. If inaccurate information about impacts causes increased harm to poor people, social welfare will decrease. More information will not be better than no information at all. It might seem that the problem outlined above could be solved by adjusting observed prices or by using other methods to calculate impact. But such solutions are extraordinarily difficult to implement. For example, to compare the Mauritanian and Swedish teachers accurately, one would have to calculate the Mauritanian’s wage if the country were well governed and the economy booming. This requires constructing an economic model of the national economy and then simulating how it would function under better governance. Such calculations remain at the frontier of economic theory. Even the most advanced models reduce complex economies to simplified, stick-figure representations of activity. They also require extensive data and research to calibrate and are often opaque in their assumptions and outputs. Ongoing debates surrounding models of the social cost of carbon illustrate just how contested and fragile these estimates can be. Accurately determining the "true" price of every resource in every country is, in practice, impossible. What about simply weighting impacts in poor countries to match those in wealthy ones? In principle, this could work—but how should the weights be determined? One alternative is to use purchasing power parity (PPP)—a method of determining the buying power in local currencies for a basket of goods. It is thought to better capture cost-of-living differences than exchange rates. However, switching to PPP does not fully solve the problem. For example, it still leaves us with the conclusion that Swedish workers provide three times the social value of their Mauritanian counterparts, even if employed in the same job. The creators of the PPP system—the International Comparison Program—caution against using it to compare prices at the unit or industry level across countries because the appropriate valuation factor should vary by product and context. But calculating such variable factors would require building and validating comprehensive models of each national economy, and as with the previous approach, it would be prohibitively difficult to implement such a system. Limiting the scope of use for impact accounting seems to be the best option. For example, impact accounting might allow for comparisons of the impacts within the same governing institution, such as the effects of extracting water in different parts of the same U.S. state. Alternatively, impact accounting could concentrate on genuinely global effects—those that transcend national boundaries—such as the environmental impact of corporate greenhouse gas emissions or global carbon sinks, such as forests and oceanic phytoplankton. We hope our arguments will lead to significant changes in how impact is measured, but that is beyond our control. We expect the proponents of impact accounting to continue to promote it as the heir apparent to ESG. If they are successful, managers and investors may soon confront impact accounting measures. Some guidance in their use is in order: 1. Beware of claims to accuracy. Impact accounting measures present as precise and interpretable dollar values, but this is an illusion. They rest on layers and layers of approximations and assumptions. Understanding those layers is crucial. 2. Avoid cross-country comparisons. Using impact accounts to compare firms across borders—especially between rich and poor nations—risks serious misrepresentation. Impact measures are likely to discount harm to poor people. 3. Check against common sense. If impact accounting tells you water consumption is less harmful where water is scarce, ask why. Check against first principles. Scarcity should increase value, not reduce it. 4. Recognize that impact accounting may be just the latest idea for an easy fix to social and environmental problems. Over the past 40 years, many solutions have been proposed for leveraging the power of business to advance sustainability. All have come and gone, all but one: strengthened institutions. 5. Strengthen institutions. As Acemoglu and Johnston have shown, social outcomes are better where institutions are stronger. We don’t need Nobel Laureates to tell us, we know that from experience. Controlling institutions have made our air and water cleaner, our cars safer, our resources better protected, and our living standard higher. Such institutions are constantly under attack, yet they remain the best way to improve our planet. Impact accounting will likely come and go, but the effect of our institutions will remain. So, strengthen them, be it a social club, local government, national system, or international organization. Doing that will have a real impact.

Title: 5 Job Titles That Will Disappear By 2030
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwells/2025/08/11/5-job-titles-that-will-disappear-by-2030/

ByRachel Wells ByRachel Wells, Contributor. By 2030, an alarming 50% of entry-level jobs could be eliminated due to AI gains, Anthropic CEO warned in May this year. And in my exclusive interview a couple weeks ago with Oliver Yonchev, investor and co-founder of Flight Agencies (alongside Steven Bartlett), he revealed: “The entry-level layer of jobs is going to disappear." What’s taking their place? The clock is ticking. Back in 2023, Goldman Sachs predicted that nearly one-fifth of all work tasks globally would be taken over by AI, with two-thirds of U.S. jobs exposed in some way or another to partial automation. Today, that figure shows no signs of decline. We now have: So the critical question is, Is your job at risk from AI? Artificial intelligence developments are accelerating at such a rapid rate that it’s hard to tell precisely what roles will be negatively impacted in the future. However, we can use estimates and reports from McKinsey & Company, the World Economic Forum, and Coursera to guide us and to make it easier to predict what job titles are most likely to disappear in the next few years. To know if your role is in danger of elimination, ask yourself the below questions and run this test: If your answer is yes to questions one, three, and four, and especially six, your role is likely at high risk of being taken over by AI at some point now or in the near future. If you answer yes to one or more of the other questions, you’re in a good position--even if your organization is preparing to implement and roll out AI, because your strategic role could be an integral factor in getting them to that position. The online learning giant Coursera released a list of five core job categories that are exposed to AI. These are: Many of these, especially in manufacturing, retail, and admin, shouldn’t really come as a surprise, because we started seeing innovation and automation in these fields for quite a number of years now (i.e., robots in production lines, self-service checkouts, chatbots used for customer service, etc.). Still, the effects can be painful, especially if you’ve worked most of your working life in these very fields. So what should you do if you discover that your job is not AI-proof? 1. First, identify roles within your industry that leverage your existing knowledge and experience, but allow you to pivot to AI-enabled functions. For example, if you work in sales, focus on relationship-building at a strategic level, for example, B2B sales and nurturing large customer accounts as a customer success manager, or account executive for a SaaS company, while using AI tools to support each part of the sales cycle. This utilizes human-centric and decision-making skills. (At this point, no one trusts AI to fully conduct the entire sales process, especially when companies are making major enterprise purchases as part of their agreed budgets, so you’re pretty safe here.) 2. Re-invent yourself for low-risk roles. The top low-risk roles include: 3. Focus on upskilling with the necessary AI skills. Learn about the most in-demand, high-paying AI skills here in my recent article, 17 AI Skills To Put On Your Resume In 2025. 4. Re-brand your career assets, especially your resume and LinkedIn profile, to highlight your AI skills, any AI certificates or courses completed, and adaptability. Don’t wait for the very role you’re in to crumble before you decide to make a move. Be proactive, identify your vulnerabilities and skills gap, and spend time each week spotting trends in your field, upskilling, and taking small steps to pivot so you’re ready for the change.

Stock futures are edging higher ahead of key inflation data due later this week; Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reportedly agreed to pay a portion of their revenues to the U.S. government in exchange for chip export licenses; Intel (INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan is set to visit the White House after President Trump called for his resignation; and Bitcoin is rising near record levels, leading cryptocurrency-related stocks higher. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are pointing higher after the major market indexes posted gains last week, and ahead of inflation data and tech earnings due later this week. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.3% in the premarket after the blue chip index added 1.6% last week. Nasdaq futures are up 0.2% after the the tech-heavy index closed at a record high to finish last week. S&P 500 futures are little changed to higher in premarket trading. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note and oil futures are little changed. Gold futures are slightly lower after surging last week. Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are expected to give the U.S. government a 15% share of revenues from sales of certain chips sold in China in exchange for export licenses, the Financial Times reported. AMD said in its recent earnings report that restrictions on its China chip sales resulted in an $800 million hit. Nvidia is set to report its quarterly earnings later this month. AMD shares are about 2% lower in premarket trading, while Nvidia shares are down close to 1%. Intel (INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan is set to visit the White House after Trump called for his resignation last week, The Wall Street Journal reported. Tan could use the visit to address concerns about his personal and professional background, while also communicating the importance of Intel’s manufacturing capabilities, the report said. Shares of Intel are up 2% in premarket trading. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is surging near all-time highs, rising more than 2.5% to trade above $121,100. Bitcoin’s record high was $123,218 set on July 14, when it jumped after the U.S. enacted legislation beneficial to the cryptocurrency industry. Shares of Bitcoin treasury company Strategy (MSTR) are up by more than 3% in premarket trading, while crypto brokerage Coinbase (COIN) and mining firms Mara Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) are also higher. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world’s largest lithium producer, are jumping more than 10% in premarket trading as Chinese battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (CATL) suspends production at a major lithium mine. Bloomberg News reported that the stoppage could last three months and is due to a permitting issue. Lithium is used to make electric vehicle batteries, among other industrial uses. Chile-based Sociedad Quimica y Minera, or SQM (SQM), is seeing its shares rise by more than 8%. The mining delays come after another Chinese lithium miner suspended production in July.

Business Crypto exchange Bullish is targeting a valuation of up to $4.82 billion after upsizing its initial public offering on Monday, underscoring sustained investor interest in digital assets. Venture capitalist Peter Thiel-backed Bullish's raise, still well below its $9-billion valuation target in a failed 2021 blank-check merger, showcases the expanding role that crypto companies are playing in the momentum built by the IPO markets. "In many cases the initial price range is set well below a company's last private valuation or below what the company had originally hoped for," said Kat Liu, vice president at IPO research firm IPOX. The crypto sector's recent climb to a $4-trillion market value has boosted public market sentiment.

Title: Is the A.I. Boom Turning Into an A.I. Bubble?

When Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chipmaker Nvidia, met with Donald Trump in the White House last week, he had reason to be cheerful. Most of Nvidia’s chips, which are widely used to train generative artificial-intelligence models, are manufactured in Asia. Earlier this year, it pledged to increase production in the United States, and on Wednesday Trump announced that chip companies that promise to build products in the United States would be exempt from some hefty new tariffs on semiconductors that his Administration is preparing to impose. The next day, Nvidia’s stock hit a new all-time high, and its market capitalization reached $4.4 trillion, making it the world’s most valuable company, ahead of Microsoft, which is also heavily involved in A.I. Welcome to the A.I. boom, or should I say the A.I. bubble? It has been more than a quarter of a century since the bursting of the great dot-com bubble, during which hundreds of unprofitable internet startups issued stock on the Nasdaq, and the share prices of many tech companies rose into the stratosphere. In March and April of 2000, tech stocks plummeted; subsequently many, but by no means all, of the internet startups went out of business. There has been some discussion on Wall Street in the past few months about whether the current surge in tech is following a similar trajectory. In a research paper entitled “25 Years On; Lessons from the Bursting of the Technology Bubble,” which was published in March, a team of investment analysts from Goldman Sachs argued that it wasn’t: “While enthusiasm for technology stocks has risen sharply in recent years, this has not represented a bubble because the price appreciation has been justified by strong profit fundamentals.” The analysts pointed to the earnings power of the so-called Magnificent Seven companies: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Between the first quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of this year, Nvidia’s revenues quintupled, and its after-tax profits rose more than tenfold. The Goldman paper also provided a salutary history lesson. Between 1995 and 2000, it pointed out, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose fivefold, and at the peak of the market a widely used valuation measure for the stocks that trade on it—the price-to-earnings ratio, or “P/E”—topped a hundred and fifty, a level not seen before or since then. By comparison, the five-year period from March, 2020, to March, 2025, had been relatively tame. It’s true, the Nasdaq had roughly doubled, and the P/E ratio had gone up considerably; but it hadn’t got anywhere near three figures. Having written extensively on the dot-com boom and bust, I found some of Goldman’s analysis persuasive. Many people have either forgotten, or are too young to remember, the extremes reached during the dot-com years. In the logic of speculative hysterias—from the seventeenth-century “tulipmania” in Holland to the rise of Pets.com—greed, FOMO, and the greater-fool theory of investing eventually combine to banish caution, common sense, and financial gravity. Back in March, there was plenty of FOMO and trend-following on Wall Street, but it hadn’t reached the levels of the late nineties. Five months on, however, echoes of the dot-com era are getting louder. Consider Palantir Technologies, whose A.I. software is used by the Pentagon, the C.I.A., and ICE, not to mention by many commercial companies. A couple of days before Huang visited the White House, Palantir released a positive earnings report. By the end of the week, according to the Yahoo Finance database, the market was valuing the company at more than six hundred times its earnings from the past twelve months, and at about a hundred and thirty times its sales in that same time span. Even during the late nineties, figures like these would have raised eyebrows. Eye-popping I.P.O.s, another feature of the dot-com era, are also making a comeback. At the end of July, Figma, a firm that makes software used by internet developers, and which has added A.I. features to its suite of products, issued stock on the New York Stock Exchange at thirty-three dollars a share. When trading started, the price jumped to eighty-five. It closed the day at $115.50—a two-hundred-and-fifty-per-cent gain on the offering price. Watching this market action, I was reminded of August 9, 1995, when Netscape, which made the Netscape Navigator web browser, went public. Its stock was priced at twenty-eight dollars, rose to seventy-five, and closed at $58.25. In percentage terms, this leap was smaller than the first-day rise in Figma’s stock, but it’s often described as the beginning of the dot-com bubble. It should be noted that, since Figma’s I.P.O., its stock has fallen back to below eighty dollars. This could be interpreted as a sign of sanity prevailing, but, given that the shares are still trading at more than double the offering price, other privately owned A.I. companies will be encouraged to enter the stock market. Renaissance Capital, a research firm that specializes in I.P.O.s, lists eight prominent candidates: OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Databricks, SymphonyAI, Waymo, Scale AI, and Perplexity. Almost all of these companies are unicorns: they have been valued at more than a billion dollars in fund-raising deals with venture capitalists and other early investors. But, across the country, according to the research firm Tracxn, there are about seven thousand smaller and lesser-known A.I. companies, more than a thousand of which have already received Series A funding from external backers to finance their operations. The ready availability of early-stage funding means that a necessary condition for a dot-com-style bubble is in place. So are three more: excitement among investors about a pathbreaking technology—generative A.I. clearly has the potential to impact great swaths of the economy; a Wall Street production line staffed by investment bankers eager to earn fees for organizing I.P.O.s; and accommodative policy. Last month, the Trump Administration announced an “AI Action Plan,” which aims to remove barriers to the deployment of the new technology and to deter individual states from introducing “burdensome” regulatory A.I. laws. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, appears to be preparing to cut interest rates next month, which could give another boost to the markets. There are, however, some important differences between now and the nineties, one of which is that the online economy is no longer a vast open plain on which enterprising individuals can propose to build castles to the sky. It is a redoubt of monopoly capitalism, in which Big Tech dominates the horizon. During the dot-com era, or its early stages, anyway, small startups could reasonably hope to exploit first-mover advantage, gain early traction, and create durable business franchises. In the A.I. economy, it seems possible that many of the rewards will go to top firms that can afford to build and maintain large A.I. models and can use their market power and financial might to ward off, or buy out, potential competitors. A vigorous antitrust policy could perhaps prevent this from happening, but, as the Wall Street Journal reported last week, the Administration’s pledge to pursue such a policy is now under threat from lobbyists and power brokers with close ties to the President. If investors decide that monopolies are the future of the A.I.-driven economy, the outcome in the stock market could well mean further gains for existing industry giants rather than a broad-based bubble. All of this is uncertain, of course. The A.I. boom is still in the stage of building out infrastructure—training large language models, building data centers, and so on. A.I. applications are just beginning to diffuse throughout the economy, and nobody knows for sure just how transformative, and profitable, the technology will be. In this environment, many investors are following the time-honored gold-rush strategy of buying the shovel-makers and big mine owners. But history teaches us that even this strategy is far from risk-free. In an interesting analysis that was posted on the financial-news platform Seeking Alpha, an analyst identified as KCI Research compared Nvidia to Cisco Systems, one of the firms whose stock went parabolic in 1998-99. Just as Nvidia’s G.P.U.s (graphics-processing units) are now widely regarded as must-have components of A.I. infrastructure, Cisco’s routers and other network equipment were viewed as essential components of the internet build-out; for a time, demand for them seemed virtually unlimited. Like Nvidia, Cisco was an innovative and highly profitable company. But, in April of 2000, its stock dropped by almost forty per cent, and a year later it had fallen by about eighty per cent. A quarter of a century on, it still hasn’t recovered the high it hit in early 2000, although, lately, it has come close. The Nvidia-Cisco comparison was a useful reminder of a dictum from the pioneering stock analyst Benjamin Graham, who was a mentor to Warren Buffett: in the short run, the stock market is a voting machine, but in the long run it is a weighing machine that weighs the cash flows that companies generate. Ironically, the Nvidia-Cisco analogy also inadvertently demonstrated how long the short run can last for, and how dangerous it can be to predict its end date. The analysis was posted in February of last year. Since then, Nvidia’s stock price has risen by another hundred and fifty per cent. ♦

Title: Three Numbers That Prove Arista Is An Elite Tech Stock In Disguise

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Arista Networks Inc. (NYSE: ANET) does not manufacture GPUs. It does not develop AI models. Additionally, it seldom attracts attention like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) or Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Nonetheless, Arista has quietly emerged as one of the most impactful technology firms in the market. Strong Q2 results and elevated guidance propelled the stock to all-time highs, climbing 20% in the last five days compared to a 1.7% increase for the S&P 500. Three significant figures illustrate why Arista ranks among the most profitable and resilient players in the industry. Seeking upside with less volatility than individual stocks? The Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having surpassed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its launch. Separately, check out What’s Happening With Joby Stock? Arista achieved a 40.3% net margin in Q2—higher than Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), or Microsoft. It also sells hardware. The catalyst is Arista’s cloud-native EOS (Extensible Operating System), which transforms conventional networking hardware into a software-defined platform. This leads to high margins and stable, recurring demand from hyperscalers such as Meta and Microsoft (accounting for over 40% of revenue). Over half of Arista’s revenue is converted into cash. Its 54% operating cash flow margin ranks among the top 5% of S&P 500 firms—including most SaaS companies. This cash supports innovation, growth, and a balance sheet that is already among the strongest in the tech industry. Having $8.1 billion in cash (56% of assets) and no debt allows Arista to invest during downturns, protect its market standing, and expand globally without needing external financing. This strength has been tested: Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks performed during and after the last six market crashes. Arista is valued at 23.5x sales, 50.7x earnings, and 46.2x free cash flow—significantly higher than the S&P 500 averages. On paper, it appears more like a SaaS company than a conventional networking entity. The distinction lies in execution. With established demand from major cloud providers, software-like margins, and an expanding role in AI data centers, Arista is enhancing its position in a rapidly growing market. Arista is not widely acknowledged outside of technology circles, but its profitability, strong balance sheet, and role in AI infrastructure render it a pivotal player in the sector. The stock is not inexpensive, and hazards persist, yet its performance has consistently justified its valuation. For investors seeking opportunities beyond chips and AI models, Arista provides access to the infrastructure that supports AI’s expansion—and the market is beginning to recognize this. That being said, investing in a single stock carries risks. You might consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stock benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to yield strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered a responsive approach to maximizing profitable market conditions while mitigating losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

This isn’t a company in trouble. Quite the opposite: Microsoft just reported a quarterly net income of $27.2 billion, and its stock price has soared past $500 per share. So, why is it laying off thousands? The answer is chilling and profoundly important: Microsoft’s layoffs are not a sign of distress—they are a strategic reallocation of resources in response to a fundamental shift in how work gets done in the artificial intelligence (AI) era. These cuts are the canary in the coal mine—an early but unmistakable signal that the world of work, especially knowledge work, is about to be dramatically reshaped by AI. The implications are as important for tech leaders as they are for educators, entrepreneurs and policymakers. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella described the layoffs as a difficult but necessary part of aligning the company’s workforce with its strategic priorities. Those priorities are now unmistakably centred on AI. Also Read: Layoff riddle: Why are companies getting worse at letting employees go? So far, Microsoft has invested over $80 billion in building its AI infrastructure. Tools like GitHub Copilot are now writing as much as 30% of its code. In other words, AI is already replacing work previously done by humans—starting with highly-skilled engineers. The jobs cuts, however, swept through gaming studios, legal teams, sales departments and even marketing. Several promising creative projects, such as the long-anticipated reboot of Perfect Dark, were quietly cancelled. Some affected studios were unionized, a sign that even organized workforces are not immune. This is not a temporary cost-cutting exercise. It is a strategic reshaping of the workforce. The new mantra inside Microsoft—“Intensity, clarity, and bold execution"—isn’t just motivational. It reflects a shift toward a leaner, faster and increasingly automated workforce. Microsoft’s central position in enterprise software and cloud infrastructure gives it an unmatched view of business sentiment and technology trends. When Microsoft cuts jobs, it often foreshadows broader shifts in the economy. In this case, the warning is stark: AI is not just a tool to augment jobs—it is replacing them outright. Also Read: AI didn’t take the job. It changed what the job is. Amazon, Google, Meta, Salesforce and many others have also made deep cuts, some citing AI directly. Even traditionally ‘safe’ white-collar roles are increasingly vulnerable. A recent report from Microsoft Research listed programmers, mathematicians, customer service agents, translators, researchers, writers, legal assistants and salespeople among the first in line for disruption. This challenges a popular myth—that only routine or low-end jobs are at risk. AI excels at generating code, writing and summarizing documents, and analysing large data-sets. And it is improving rapidly. Many tech CEOs like to downplay the coming tsunami with soothing ideas such as “AI won’t replace you—a person using AI will" and “every technology destroys some jobs but creates many others and AI is no different." These are simplistic and self-serving. Be very clear: in the medium and short terms, which are what matter for most of us, AI will likely have a devastating impact on a lot of white-collar jobs and wages. For countries like India, this poses both risks and transformative opportunities. On one hand, millions of our white-collar jobs in information technology (IT) services, business process outsourcing (BPO) and content creation are at risk. These sectors have been engines of upward mobility and economic growth. If we are not proactive, AI could erode much of this progress. On the other hand, AI has the potential to unlock new solutions in education, healthcare, agriculture and public services. It can dramatically increase productivity, personalize services and bridge gaps in human capacity. But only if we invest in the right infrastructure, skills and safety nets. Also Read: Devina Mehra: Yes, AI is coming for our jobs; it’s the old story of new tech How the AI revolution plays out isn’t a given; it will be shaped by the choices that we make as CEOs , policymakers and leaders. As a tech and development leader, I believe we need a radically new playbook to navigate this transformation. Re-imagine education and skilling: We must move beyond traditional degree-based learning and embrace lifelong, flexible and tech-enabled skill development. Foundational digital literacy, data fluency and adaptability must be priorities. Support mass entrepreneurship: If formal employment is shrinking due to automation, we must create the conditions for millions to become self-employed or run micro-enterprises. In the 21st century, entrepreneurship is not a career choice—it is a life skill. Governments and the private sector should invest in promoting entrepreneurship, small businesses and strengthening local entrepreneurship ecosystems. Build an inclusive AI strategy: AI should not be designed only for the rich. India must lead the world in AI applications that serve small farmers, frontline health workers, teachers, small business owners and informal workers, ensuring that the revolution lifts the many, not just the few. Foster humane corporate cultures: The way layoffs are being handled—often without notice or severance—risks breaking trust in organizations. Companies must find a more responsible and compassionate approach to workforce transition. Culture, after all, is a competitive advantage. Create public policy for resilience: Governments must track labour market shifts in real time and build social safety nets that are fit for the AI era, whether that means unemployment insurance, portable benefits or incentives for reskilling. Also Read: Siddharth Pai: Don’t be naive, Agentic AI won’t eliminate agency costs When coal miners took canaries into their mines, it wasn’t because they didn’t expect danger. It was to act quickly when signs appeared. Microsoft’s layoffs are that sign. They tell us that AI is not something for the distant future. It’s already here, and is changing how work takes place, who gets employed and what skills matter. We simply cannot afford to sleepwalk into this future. We must act now—with clarity, courage and care. This is not just a tech issue. It is a social, economic and moral challenge that will define our generation. Let’s not waste the warning. Let’s build a future where AI empowers and uplifts, rather than excludes and displaces.

Title: The end of the mega-employer

Time Published: 2025-08-11T08:09:01Z

In June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had a blunt message for his 350,000 corporate employees: There were going to be fewer of them in the near future, thanks to the "efficiency gains" he expected from AI. The proclamation generated big headlines and an uproar from staff. But it struck me as merely honest. He was acknowledging something that pretty much every CEO who sits atop a large white-collar workforce is quietly hoping to achieve sooner or later. After all, Jassy hasn't been the only executive to hint at a future of lower headcount. The head of JPMorgan's consumer and community business predicted in May that AI will reduce the number of employees in its operations division by 10%. That same month, the CEO of Klarna said that the company's investments in AI has already driven the company's headcount to shrink by 40%. And the CEO of Ford — a company that employs tens of thousands of white-collar professionals — declared that AI will wipe out "literally half" of all white-collar jobs. Meanwhile, Kian Katanforoosh, the CEO and founder of the software startup Workera, tells me that he never wants to have much more than the 80 or so employees he has today, no matter how successful his business ends up becoming. "I truly believe we can go super super far without growing more," he says. "I'm an engineer. I don't want to have to manage so many people if I don't need to." It's not like CEOs ever enjoyed shelling out for the salaries or navigating the personnel headaches that come with the sprawling bureaucracies they employ. But for more than a century, armies of office workers were a necessary cost of doing business. To grow from tiny upstarts into titans of industry, companies needed an ever-multiplying number of HR reps, accountants, marketers, engineers, analysts, and project managers. In recent months, that 100-year-trend is starting to come undone. Everywhere you look, AI appears to be helping leaner teams take on work that used to require more people. And executives are talking about their large workforces — once their greatest competitive advantage — as if they're an unfortunate holdover from a bygone, bloated era. If today's corporate giants shrink their ranks, and if tomorrow's giants never need to bulk up in the first place, we may well be witnessing the end of a defining feature of corporate America: the mega-employer. That could give rise to a whole new generation of nimble companies that innovate faster — but also leave workers navigating a world of diminished career paths and fewer jobs. Before the Industrial Revolution, most Americans worked for themselves as farmers or craftsmen. And those who didn't worked for very small operations — say, a few journeymen training under a master shoemaker. The resulting economy was a patchwork of all these tiny businesses. That started to change with the advent of capital-intensive industries like textile manufacturing, which required organizing larger groups of people under a single employer. Then came railroads in the late 19th century. With projects that took many years to realize and stretched over thousands of miles, vast numbers of workers needed to be on the same page. "If you mess it up, there's a big explosion," says Louis Hyman, a political economy historian at Johns Hopkins. "You needed to really coordinate your mechanisms and make sure that people are doing things exactly the same way." As mass production developed, Hyman says, many of the most consequential innovations during this time weren't so much technical breakthroughs: They were social inventions to coordinate the labor of all the people it took to get the most out of the new machines. The assembly line broke down complicated work into simple, repeatable, standardized tasks; scientific management emphasized the importance of monitoring, measuring, and optimizing everyone's performance; and the M-form corporate structure created a blueprint to manage sprawling bureaucracies through a clear chain of command. In the 1930s, about a tenth of the labor force worked for businesses that employed at least 10,000 people. By the end of World War II, that share had surged to about a third. By the 1970s, some of that bigger-is-better ideology started to change. A new management philosophy set in, normalizing layoffs that took aim at bloat. And as robots automated many blue-collar jobs, IBM mainframes and word processors eliminated a whole set of white-collar clerical roles as well. Still, there was plenty of work that technology couldn't automate, which meant that companies needed large teams of college-educated professionals to keep them going. Even the most tech-forward companies saw their people — especially their coders — as mission-critical to their success. "Hiring great people — especially engineers — is one of the biggest challenges that any technology company has," Mark Zuckerberg lamented in 2013. "Our country doesn't produce the volume of engineers that the companies would want to hire." Tech giants often hired more than they needed to make sure they had a steady supply of talent, and to attract and retain the best of the best, they treated their employees like gods. If you were to pinpoint one moment the gods turned mortal, it would probably be November 9, 2022 — the day Meta laid off more than 11,000 employees. From there, virtually every tech company followed suit, with employers across other industries close behind. At first, the cuts were chalked up to overhiring in the pandemic. But two and a half years later, the layoffs haven't stopped and hiring is still down. More and more, AI appears to be driving those austerity measures. In an industry that once hoarded talent like gold, the shift is striking. CEOs no longer seem to view the bulk of their workforce as indispensable, and they say as much: A common refrain among tech leaders from Mark Zuckerberg to Elon Musk to Dara Khosrowshahi now is some version of "If you don't like it here, you should leave." Companies like Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Salesforce had reliably increased their headcounts year after year. Now, according to the workforce analytics provider Live Data, all of them employ fewer people than they did at their 2022 peak. J. Scott Hamilton, Live Data's CEO, says this is probably just the beginning. To gauge how much deeper the cuts could go, his team recently analyzed the detailed responsibilities of most roles at Microsoft to estimate the share of tasks that could, in theory, be done by AI. Their conclusion: If Microsoft were to offload all of those automatable tasks to AI, it would eliminate 36% of the work currently done by employees. That would mean the company could lay off some 80,000 employees. On the one hand, that's an aggressive scenario: Companies are rarely able to overhaul their workflows to take full advantage of a new automation technology's capabilities. If they do, that transition takes a very long time. And besides, some work is simply too high-stakes to entrust to error-prone AI — even if it's technically possible. On the other, the estimate may prove conservative: Live Data's predictions assume that AI will remain at 2025-level capabilities. Given how much better the leading large language models have become over the last two years, the best tools will almost certainly be able to handle more than what they can today. "The optimists are saying that the good companies will simply redeploy the assets elsewhere now that they can be more efficient," Hamilton says. "But I think an equal argument can be made that they'll just say, 'We're going to do the same amount with fewer people.'" If that sounds like a far-off hypothetical future, consider what's already happening today at startups. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says he's making bets with his friends on when we'll get the first "one-person billion-dollar company." And Arthur Kaneko, a general partner at Coreline Ventures, tells me he's noticed that early-stage founders are raising their initial rounds of funding with fewer employees than they would have had in the past — among the AI-fluent founders, perhaps with less than half. "The way companies are being built is just fundamentally changing right now because of AI," Kaneko says. "Through the use of AI coding, AI marketing, AI sales, people are able to do a lot more work with way fewer people." And he thinks these startups will stay lean as they scale into successful businesses. "They just won't hire the people that Meta and Microsoft had to hire to get to where they are," he says. "I do think per-company headcount will permanently be depressed in startups." There are reasons to be hopeful about a new era of smaller employers. If AI makes it cheaper and easier to launch companies, we'll probably see more of them — and that would be great for the long-term health of the economy in all kinds of ways. New businesses tend to employ people with less experience and fewer credentials who get passed up by the bigger companies. They're more willing to try new things, which drives innovation. And they create more competition for the established giants, which is good for consumers. Smaller companies may also be good for the workers inside them. There's a lot that people hate about working at big organizations: the constant turf wars, the endless layers of approval, the meetings before the meetings, the sense that you're just one tiny inconsequential cog in a giant machine. Smaller bureaucracies would minimize that, which is one reason why people often feel more motivated in leaner workplaces. According to Gallup, employees at small companies report the highest engagement, with scores dropping below the national average once organizations hit 500 employees. On the same stage where Altman made his one-person unicorn prediction, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian raved about the benefits of this possibility. "CEOs and founders are going to be so excited to get up and go to work with much smaller, much more performant, much more culturally strong teams," he said. But a world of shrunken employers could also rob workers of something essential: the long-term career paths that big companies used to offer. With so many roles under one roof, big companies made it possible for workers to try new things, move up, and build careers. Smaller firms don't offer the same range of opportunities, which means people will likely need to switch companies a lot more in the future. Smaller firms are also less likely to invest in on-the-job training — a shift that would hit early-career professionals hard, just as their roles face the greatest risk from AI. The big question is what this all means for college-educated workers. If enough startups emerge, they might create new jobs to offset the ones disappearing from big companies. But that would require an unprecedented boom in entrepreneurship — one enormous enough to make up for the retrenchment of the giants. In 2022, 29% of the American workforce worked for an organization that employed at least 10,000 people. Meanwhile, the country's education system is churning out ever more college grads, who studied hard with the expectation of a stable future in white-collar work. If big companies hire less, and small companies also hire less, where will they all go? The usual reassurance is that AI, like every disruptive technology before it, will eventually create more jobs than it destroys. That glosses over an important detail, according to Carl Benedikt Frey, an economist at Oxford. In the early stages of the Industrial Revolution, most innovations simply made existing work faster and cheaper — like the loom, which automated the work of skilled weavers but still produced more or less the same fabric. That made a handful of industrialists very rich, but for the average worker, wages barely budged for the first 80 or so years of industrialization. It was only later — with inventions like electricity and the automobile that gave rise to entirely novel industries — that economic growth surged and better, high-paying jobs emerged. Had that second wave never arrived, we'd remember the Industrial Revolution very differently. "Most productivity gains over the long run," Frey says, "come from doing new and previously inconceivable things." Right now, corporate America seems stuck in that first phase. So many executives are laser-focused on using AI to do the same work with fewer people, rather than applying it to problems we couldn't solve before — the kind of breakthroughs that would open up new lines of business and generate more demand for labor, not less. "A real risk is that we're getting leaner organizations, but they're not really creating that much new," Frey says. "That would be a bleak future, and I do worry we're moving in that direction."

Title: OpenAI to give employees ‘special’ million-dollar bonuses amid AI talent wars
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-employees-special-million-dollar-bonuses-ai-talent-wars-10182286/

OpenAI has announced a ‘special one-time award’ to its AI researchers and engineers across several departments, including applied engineering, scaling, and safety. The bonuses were announced a day before the Microsoft-backed AI startup unveiled GPT-5, its latest and most advanced large language model (LLM). More than 1,000 OpenAI employees are eligible for the bonus, according to a report by The Verge. The ChatGPT-maker is currently valued at $300 billion. While the exact bonus amounts are not known, it will likely depend on the role and seniority of qualified employees, with the highest million-dollar payouts reportedly going to OpenAI’s prized AI researchers, who already draw salaries worth millions of dollars every year. The engineers, on the other hand, will reportedly receive bonuses amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars on average, the report said. However, these bonuses are not likely to be paid out at once. Instead, it will be disbursed over the next two years with qualified workers having the option to receive the money in OpenAI stock, cash, or both. “As we mentioned a few weeks ago, we have been looking at comp for our technical teams given the movement in the market,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was quoted as saying by The Verge. “We very much intend to keep increasing comp as we keep doing better and better as a company. But we wanted to be transparent about this one since it’s a new thing for us,” Altman added. This is reportedly the first time that OpenAI has offered bonuses to such a large number of employees, about one-third of the company’s full workforce. The move comes against the backdrop of a rapidly intensifying war for AI talent. Several companies have poached OpenAI researchers with lucrative offers, and Meta has led the charge. Since the one-time special bonus does not apply to all employees, OpenAI risks losing more workers, who may feel overlooked, to other companies. Mark Chen, OpenAI’s research officer, has previously likened Meta’s aggressive poaching spree to a home invasion. Shengjia Zhao, one of the creators of ChatGPT, was recently named as the chief scientist of Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). Besides Meta, Elon Musk’s xAI has also reportedly been making aggressive offers to lure away OpenAI’s top talent. Thinking Machines, an AI rival lab started by ex-OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, also comprises several of OpenAI’s technical staff. Meanwhile, OpenAI also reportedly plans to allow current and former employees to cash out with millions by selling their vested stock to investors. However, Altman has reportedly said that employees might be able to sell at a much higher share price than the current $274 per share at a higher valuation of $500 billion, according to a report by Bloomberg.

The answer has little to do with technology and everything to do with fear. Corporate leaders are quietly waiting to see who will be the first to pull the trigger. My discussions about Generative AI reveal a stark generational divide. Most people under 35 are convinced that AI is a reality, not a gimmick, and that the displacement of human workers is an urgent, present-day issue. For many over 35, the assessment is more cautious; they believe the replacement will happen, but not for another five or ten years. The problem is that the second group is several steps behind. The AI revolution isn’t being held back because the technology isn’t ready. It’s being held back for political reasons. CEOs are nervously looking at each other, waiting for someone else to make the first move and announce that they are eliminating a significant number of jobs because AI can do the work faster and cheaper. They are tiptoeing around what they already know. And they are telegraphing their intentions subliminally. Take Palantir’s CEO, Alex Karp. During an interview with CNBC in August, he said: âWeâre planning to grow our revenue â¦ while decreasing our number of people.â Karp then continued: âThis is a crazy, efficient revolution. The goal is to get 10x revenue and have 3,600 people. We have now 4,100.â The subtext is clear: Palantir already considers 500 of its employees to be a surplus that AI could replace. It could increase its revenue by 10x while reducing its workforce by almost 12.2%. Look at Amazon. The company has more than one million robots (Hercules, Pegasus, and Proteus, its fully autonomous robot) in its facilities and believes that AI will help increase its robot mobility by 10%. The number of its robots is nearly equivalent to the 1.546 million people (full-time and part-time) that the company employs globally. CEO Andy Jassy has already warned his workforce of what’s to come. âWe will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,â Jassy told employees in a memo last June. âItâs hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce.â CEOs are waiting for political cover that isn’t coming. None of them want to become the poster child for the revolution that killed human jobs in America. They don’t want to become the target of politicians, knowing that on this issue, the attacks will come from both the populist left and the populist right. The problem is that politicians are just as unprepared as the over-35s. They seem to believe this is a problem for the next administration, a challenge for a few years down the road. They are wrong. The problem is here now. The questions are urgent: what will the displaced workers do? What safety nets need to be built? What happens to the healthcare of millions who are still a long way from retirement? These are questions politicians have not yet addressed, likely because they don’t have the answers. So, for now, the CEOs are buying them time. Instead of mass firings, a quieter trend has emerged: hiring freezes. Increasingly, managers are being forced to justify why a human is needed for a role that an AI could potentially perform. This is already devastating the job market for young people. According to Handshake, a career platform for Gen Z employees, job listings for entry-level corporate roles have declined 15% over the past year. And for those who still think the great displacement is far away, the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported a few days ago that AI is already one of the top five factors contributing to job losses this year. Companies have announced over 806,000 private-sector job cuts since January, the highest number for that period since 2020. The tech industry is leading the charge. The machine is in motion. It’s not that AI can’t replace us, especially in knowledge jobs. It’s that your boss doesn’t yet have the courage to tell you they’re firing you for a robot. They don’t want to be the villain. Theyâre waiting for one of their peers to be crucified before they enter the stage. But for how long? CEOChatGPTlayoffsPolitics Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: Number Of Million-Dollar, One-Person Businesses Keeps Growing
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/elainepofeldt/2025/08/10/number-of-million-dollar-one-person-businesses-keeps-growing/

ByElaine Pofeldt ByElaine Pofeldt, Senior Contributor. Sara Connell set a big goal for herself four years ago—to break $1 million in annual revenue at her business the Thought Leader Academy. A former advertising executive, she found that workplace stress was taking a toll, contributing to depression and an eating disorder. After spotting the the memoir, Holy Hunger, written by eating disorder survivor Margaret Bullitt-Jonas, in an airport bookstore. Reading it gave Connell inspiration to leave her job and heal. “Even if I end up on the street, I’m not going to do this anymore,” she told herself. That decision, back in 2000, paid off. Connell has broken the million-dollar mark at the Thought Leader Academy, based in Chicago, for the past four years. The Thought Leader Academy helps its clients build a platform in their industries by helping them develop their writing and speaking platforms with the help of writing coaches, mastermind sessions and group mentorship programs; it also holds live events such as the upcoming three-day conference in New York City. Called Women STARTING MOVEMENTS, it is for coaches, writers and visionaries who want to build seven-figure businesses while rallying others around their mission. Along the way, Connell, who holds a master of fine arts in writing from Northwestern University, has written seven books, the latest of which is The Download, where she guides thought leaders in using neuroscience techniques to tap their biggest ideas, and built a YouTube channel, Thought Leader Media, with more than 100,000 subscribers. Connell is part of a trend that keeps accelerating: the growth of million-dollar, one person businesses. The number of nonemployer businesses breaking $1 million grew to 117,060 in 2023, up from 116,803 in 2022, according to statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau. The number in 2022 more than doubled from 2021, when it was 57,822. Nonemployer businesses, as defined by the U.S. government, don’t run payroll. They are typically run by solopreneurs but sometimes by partnerships. Although they are staffed by the owners, these businesses do include contributions from other people. They get things done through hiring contractors, outsourcing to services such as Fulfilled by Amazon, automation and increasingly, AI. There are many factors contributing to the trend. A growing number of Americans are taking control of their careers at a time corporate life is increasingly harsh, a white-collar job shortage lingers, and fears of AI loom. They are building newly optimistic futures for themselves in self-employment as an alternative. Some are starting side hustles that blossom; others, like Connell, are leaping into full-time businesses that leverage the skills, knowledge and relationships they’ve been building all along, whether in their existing careers or other parts of their lives. Still others are pushed by layoffs to pursue long-dormant business ideas. To be sure, million-dollar, one-person businesses are still outliers when it comes to their revenue. There are 30,427,808 nonemployer businesses in the U.S., and the average revenue is $57,611. That is less than the U.S. average wage of $67,920, as tracked by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, some of the businesses the Census Bureau tracks are part-time side hustles—not full-time pursuits that parallel full-time jobs. And million-dollar, one-person businesses are likely to continue multiplying, and learning from each other, as more people see they are a way to bypass a trend that keeps many from starting businesses: lack of access to capital. While building a startup often requires someone to have connections to private investors known as angels or venture capitalists, most one-person businesses are funded by the owners using scrappy, capital-efficient methods. If they scale up, it is usually through bootstrapping, or self-funding through cash-flow. Where the growth in million-dollar, one-person businesses is So how do you find your million-dollar opportunity? It helps to choose the right category of business in the first place--one where it’s possible for a solopreneur to get to $1 million. The largest group of million-dollar, one-person businesses is in retail niches, such as ecommerce, with $16,141 businesses at $1-2.49 million and 4,216 at $2.5 million to $4.99, the Census data shows. Closely following are professional services, with 16,654 businesses at $1 million to $2.49 million and 2,503 at $2.5 million to $4.99 million. Another hot category is wholesale, with 11,383 businesses at $1-2.49 million and 1,684 at $2.5-$4.99 million. It is also helpful to keep an eye on the categories that have had a significant growth trajectory in recent years. I have been writing about this trend since 2012, when it started taking off, and some categories have had more signficant increases than others since then. If you’re looking for an idea that will replace a traditional career, you’ll also want to keep an eye on sustainability. Some industries see cyclical booms. Examples are construction, an industry that currently has strong growth prospects, according to Deloitte, and mining, driven in part by the use of lithium in electric-car batteries. These types of industries are ideal if you like to jump quickly on economic trends when they’re hot but also accept there may be slow cycles, too. Other niches, such as professional services, have slowly and steadily offered opportunities to break $1 million in the past decade. Despite all of the warnings from business gurus not to “trade time for dollars,” some non-employer professional services firms in fields such as accounting are consistently breaking $1 million in revenue by offering valuable services to clients who keep coming back. Despite all of the ads on social media promising a way to make “passive income,” building a sustainable million-dollar, one-person business is often a multi-year effort with lots of experimentation. After leaving her advertising job, for instance, Connell took on freelance and part-time work while getting her coaching certification and starting a coaching practice in 2004. However, she says she struggled for years to earn a consistent income as a coach. “It was very difficult to put together a profitable business,” she says. Her breakthrough came when she had broken six-figure revenue as a coach in approximately 2016 and began shifting her focus--with the help of her own coaches-- from bringing in revenue to building her profits and cashflow. She also focused on her mindset, working on healing her own past trauma, using techniques such as tapping. “I have noticed a huge connection between trauma and earning, particularly for women,” she says. “I kept smacking up against an invisible ceiling until I did that work. That was the inflection point, that took us to a million dollars consistently and kept us growing." Introducing the Thought Leader Academy helped her bring the business to the $200,000 mark and beyond. This was one of her first significant shifts from offering one-on-one coaching to her clients to an academy model, focused on teaching clients in group settings. One particularly popular offering has been bootcamps, such as the Bestselling Book Bootcamp, designed to help clients determine what they will write and outline their books. On the recommendation of one of her coaches, she gave each bootcamp a theme, such as “writing a transformational book. She rolls out downloadable content that supports the bootcamps over the eight weeks beforehand to build community around the ideas. “We did eight weeks of sharing about ‘What’s the difference? Why might one want to focus on transformation versus information?’" she explains. “It created interest and curiosity and also differentiated this bootcamp from another one.” Public speaking helps her attract her ideal customers. “We went to $1 million with no ads, no social media,” she says. Today, her YouTube channel also helps attracts like-minded clients. She surveys her ideal customers before rolling out new offerings to make sure there is interest in purchasing them before fully developing an idea. Connell initially did most of the work of the business herself, but realized that to scale her revenue and profits, she needed to build a virtual team to support her. Today, she relies on six service providers: contracted writing coaches and vendors such as graphic designers, a virtual assistant and an automation contractor to extend what she can do individually. “We have wonderful people I consider part of my team, but they’re not a team from an employee standpoint,” she says. As for the future, Connell plans to keep growing the business, with an eye toward bringing clients a fresh take on what’s happening in the market. “It really lights me up to think about what’s happening in the world, and what’s happening in the marketplace, and to help someone figure out their book’s focus and how it will be positioned,” she says. Meanwhile, she’s on the front lines of defining what it means to run a million-dollar, one-person business, a phenomenon that it likely to evolve considerably as artificial intelligence (AI) makes it easier than ever before for solopreneurs to get more done with fewer resources and to combine their own intelligence with that of machines. “I want to be part of this age of AI,” she says.

Title: ROSEN, RECOGNIZED INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages Novo Nordisk A/S Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action - NVO

August 10, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Aug. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announces the filing of a class action lawsuit on behalf of purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Second Quarter Earnings Season: Waiting For NVIDIA
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/08/10/second-quarter-earnings-season-waiting-for-nvidia/

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Following the second busiest week, the second-quarter earnings season begins to slow down this week, with just 6 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Deere (DE) and Applied Materials (AMAT). According to FactSet, 81% of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings above consensus estimates, with 90% of companies having already reported results. Companies reporting and combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 11.8% year-over-year, well above the 4.9% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the expected earnings growth rate for calendar year 2025 is 10.3%, and for 2026, the expectation is 13.3%. Following the better earnings results, the S&P 500 came within a hair of an all-time high last week, while the Magnificent 7 reached a new peak. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed primarily due to Apple and Tesla. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 were the group to watch this earnings season, and they did not disappoint aside from Tesla (TSLA). Furthermore, the artificial intelligence (AI) related companies reinforced the positive narrative surrounding the technology. With earnings season nearing completion, all eyes now shift to NVIDIA (NVDA), which is scheduled to report on August 27. Positive earnings surprises from the healthcare and communication services sectors were the most significant contributors to the improved earnings picture last week. Better-than-expected earnings from Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), Amgen (AMGN), and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) were the most essential contributors, according to FactSet. Following better-than-expected data last week, sales growth of 6.3% is ahead of the 4.2% year-over-year expectation at the end of the quarter. Better sales results in the financials and healthcare sectors were the most significant drivers of the improvement in expected revenue growth last week, according to FactSet. Earnings season slows to a crawl beginning this week. While the individual reports are crucial for that stock, none are going to change the overall color of the season at this point. Friday’s retail sales numbers will be an essential check on the US consumer. The soft monthly jobs report with massive downward revisions to start the month was worrisome for the health of the economy. Since the consumer drives the US economy, retail sales will be closely watched to see if the labor market is spilling over to spending. Consumer inflation (CPI) on Tuesday will be notable as the odds of a September short-term interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) have risen to 90% following the weaker-than-expected jobs report. Year-over-year CPI is expected to increase to 2.8% from 2.7%, but the data will be watched for signs that the Fed needs to delay any cuts to fight inflation. There is still one more monthly jobs report before the Fed’s September meeting, and barring an abnormally large inflation surge, the labor market will be the primary driver behind any rate cuts or lack thereof. In addition, markets have now fully priced in at least two rate cuts of 25 basis points (0.25%) in 2025. Newsflow about the administration’s trade negotiations and new tariff announcements will remain a market mover. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) releases its 13F filing after the close on Thursday. Warren Buffett continues to be a net seller of stocks, but this report provides the details. An analysis of Berkshire’s quarterly earnings is here. The increase in worries about the economy in the wake of a shockingly poor jobs report eased this week, with the betting odds of recession falling to the lows of the year. The falling odds of recession and another week of better-than-expected earnings sent stocks to near record highs.

Chairman and CEO Abel Avellan said, "Our revolutionary satellites and proprietary ASICs were designed with S-Band capabilities in mind. With these new spectrum priority rights, we will be in a position to bring services in S-Band to targeted markets around the world." He added that, combined with the company's existing global 3GPP spectrum holdings and planned L-Band strategy in the U.S. and Canada, the rights would allow expansion of subscriber capacity, enabling most countries to access the full AST SpaceMobile network with speeds targeted at up to 120 Mbps. The agreement, signed August 5, 2025, covers rights to MSS frequencies from 1980-2010 MHz and 2170-2200 MHz for use in low Earth orbit. These bands will be deployed globally subject to regulatory approval, complementing AST SpaceMobile's core cellular spectrum approach. The $64.5 million deal will be paid in cash or stock at the company's discretion, with $26 million due at closing and $38.5 million deferred, partly tied to performance milestones. Closing is expected in the second half of 2025, pending customary conditions. UBS Securities LLC is serving as financial advisor, with McGuireWoods LLP providing legal counsel.

If you’ve benefited from my podcast, newsletter, books, or anything at all, please grab a copy or two! It only costs $10-12 and can provide hours upon hours of fun. It takes minutes to learn and 10 minutes to play. Under the hood, it’s also designed to be a good workout for your brain.

This is another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show. I’m Tim Ferriss and I’m sitting with a friend of mine who I brought to my podcast with a secret agenda that has ended up two years later with a very, very not-so-secret-for-long outcome that we’re going to talk about, Elan Lee. Elan Lee: Thanks. Tim Ferriss: Nice to see you again. Elan Lee: It’s nice to see you too. That was a secret agenda. That was a two-year-in-the-making secret agenda. Tim Ferriss: Two years in the making. So what we’re going to do in this conversation, and I just hijacked his bio because I’ve had too much caffeine, so I’m going to let him do the self-intro in a second. But we’re going to give you a peek behind the curtain, under the hood, open the kimono, choose your metaphor. We’re going to talk about the creative process, the development process, thinking about distribution, retail, all of these things which I have not heard discussed anywhere else in depth. Elan Lee: You buried the lead. All of that stuff of — Tim Ferriss: Of a game that we created that from the very beginning was something I’ve wanted to do my whole life, which is create a game. I was raised, protected in some ways by Dungeons & Dragons as a kid. It was my refuge from bullying and also just the straight boredom of most of my schooling at the time. And that immersive experience, the ability to get lost in a world of imagination and fun and laughter and emotion was so incredibly important. It was so formative for me that the seed was planted really early. And I think you know this because I probably sent you a photograph of this at one point. I still have all of my modules. I have The Player’s Handbook, First Edition, Dungeon Master’s Guide, all of the dice, everything from when I was a kid. I’ve kept it to this day. Elan Lee: I love this, I love this. But hold on. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: If you’re not going to say it, I’m going to say it. Tim Ferriss made a game. Tim Ferriss: I did. Elan Lee: That’s amazing. Tim Ferriss: It took me 47 years, but here we are. So the game, I’ll just show it to camera for people who want a visual who are not watching this. If you’re listening, you can go to tim.blog/coyote. So I’m giving a bit of what you might call foreshadowing in the biz. But this is the game. It is a card game. It’s called Coyote. That name did not come easily. We went through about 537 different names and lots of testing and we’ll talk about some of that. But this is the game and it’s effectively, I’d like to hear your pitch because we have slightly different approaches, but I would say it is rock-paper-scissors on steroids. So there are God knows how many, maybe 20 different gestures, something like that, 66 total cards. And you can play cooperatively where you’re all trying to beat the game together or competitively where you can sabotage individual players, throw curveballs of all different types, and that relates to the name Coyote, if you think about the trickster mythology associated with Coyote. Elan Lee: Yeah Tim Ferriss: We never got to your bio. Who the hell are you? Elan Lee: Oh, that’s the least interesting part of this whole thing. Tim Ferriss: No, I know, but it puts it in perspective and just explain the company a bit, the scope of it, et cetera Elan Lee: I love talking about games, I hate talking about myself. So I will try. Tim Ferriss: That’s why it takes someone like me to force you to do it. Elan Lee: Yeah. Okay, here we go. My name is Elan Lee. I am the co-creator and CEO of Exploding Kittens. I believe we’re the number one independent game studio in the world, something like that. I don’t know. We’ve sold a whole bunch of games. We’ve sold 60 million games at this point and been running that company for 10 years now. And before that I was the chief design officer at the Xbox and before that I worked at a pet store. Tim Ferriss: And for people who want the full journey, including the sort of magical tinderbox that was Kickstarter way back in the day, how this whole adventure started 10 plus years ago, listen to the first conversation that I did with Elan. I had wanted to make a game and quickly realized that an RPG, something like Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game, was going to be too complicated for me and my friends as adults to play. It would be too hard for me to recruit my friends where you have, let’s just say, a full day, then you have dinner, maybe you have a few drinks, and then you have an hour before people split. There’s no way I’m going to get someone to build, for instance, a chaotic good gray elf, which was my orientation, and work from there. It’s just not going to happen. And meanwhile, about maybe it was a year or two years before I invited you on the podcast, I found this game Poetry for Neanderthals and holy shit, had so much fun with that with my friends. I thought, “Okay, I think I want to tilt my game dreams,” which at that point had no real direction, “towards something more casual.” But in the meantime, I’d also been listening to all sorts of podcasts and so on that we’ll get to. But you’ve explained your background. Elan Lee: Well, hold on. So what you just described is exactly why I started Exploding Kittens, because I also — okay, a little bit different. Unlike you, I, when I encounter those crazy two and four and six-hour games, I am immediately turned off. I can’t focus for that long. I can’t understand the rules. If it takes longer than five minutes to explain a game, I am gone. I have no ability to play that game. And so the whole reason I started this company, and I think the whole reason that you made the pivot from giant role-playing games to being interested in the creation of casual fast-party games is this golden rule of two minutes to learn, 15 minutes to play because nothing’s at stake there, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: You’re going to learn it. You’re either going to love the game or you’re going to hate it, but whatever, you committed five minutes total to that thing. And I love the games where after the five-minute commitment, you’re still going to play for two hours. But they’re going to be in these little five-minute sessions over and over and over again. And it sounds like that’s the experience you had, which makes me so happy because that means mission accomplished. That’s exactly what I wanted to build. Tim Ferriss: And we’re going to talk about different rules or tenets that you have because what I want to do in this conversation, we’re definitely going to talk about the process of building this game because I am really, really happy with it and really proud. Elan Lee: It’s so good. You should be. It’s so good. Tim Ferriss: And we’ll have a lot to talk about. But the motivation also of basically showing the cards, I’m going to use so many mixed metaphors here, is to teach people game design and explain why this has possessed such a toehold in my mind for so long. Elan Lee: Yeah. Well, you went through a journey and I’m excited looking at that journey through your eyes of, “I don’t even know what I want to build, but I know I want to build a fun experience that I would enjoy, that my friends would enjoy,” all the way through to this thing is at every Walmart and Target in North America. That journey is incredible and you got to see it for the first time. You absolutely drank from the firehose here. This was fun for me because I had to walk you through this, right? You’ve never sold a game before. So walking through the process of how you make a game and how you sell a game, it doesn’t work the way people think. So retailers have a buyer per category. So if anybody wants to sell something to a retailer, you want something in Target or Walmart or Amazon or Barnes & Noble. The way it works is you have to convince the buyer for your category to take your thing, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: They have limited shelf space. It’s very precious real estate. So you have to convince them that your thing is better than anybody else’s thing. And twice a year they have these things called line reviews.The buyers have to buy games for next year, right? They need to put stuff on the shelf. There’s only a certain number of meetings they can physically have in a period of time because it’s usually one or two or maybe three people. So they take as many meetings as they can. It’s usually a dozen, maybe two dozen. And in those meetings — Tim Ferriss: In your case, with different game manufacturers, different studios. Elan Lee: Exactly. So they’ll take a meeting with Hasbro and they’ll take a meeting with Mattel and all the big guys. And in those meetings, 20, 30, 50 games are pitched to them in every single one of those meetings. And then they’ll make a decision on which ones they’re going to purchase and stock for the next year. So that’s line review. The tricky parts for line review is one, you got to do a great job, but even before that, you got to get that meeting, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: They only have time for a certain number of meetings. So you have to put yourself in a position where you can get in that room. Tim Ferriss: All right, so we’re going to talk strategy and tactics for line review in a minute because, and take this as a compliment, you are one of the best in-person salespeople I’ve ever seen. Elan Lee: That could also be an insult, but I’ll take it, I’ll take it. Tim Ferriss: No, it’s not an insult. No, no, it’s not an insult. Everybody’s in sales, whether they like to admit it or not, whether you’re selling ideas, you’re selling a position, a perspective, if you want to call it deal making. This is what I used to say in my class, my guest lecture that I taught for 10 years, once or twice a year in high-tech entrepreneurship. I would start off by saying, “Who here wants to be in sales?” No hands would go up and I would say, “Well, I’ve got some good news and I’ve got some bad news. Bad news is you’re all in sales. And let me explain why. If you want to call it deal making, fine, you’re going to have to negotiate. You don’t get what you deserve. You get what you negotiate.” Elan Lee: That’s well said. Tim Ferriss: “And you get what you can present in a very persuasive way.” I was like, “The good news is you can learn it.” Elan Lee: Awesome. Tim Ferriss: This is a coachable, learnable skill, which I completely still believe. There’s some people who may have a little bit of extraversion, charismatic reality, distortion, field advantage, but you can become excellent even if you start with zero raw materials. Okay, so the journey, wanted to make a game my whole life, but it was this vague, “Maybe someday. God, wouldn’t it be nice?” Elan Lee: Let me just poke at that for a second. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, sure. Elan Lee: Why? Tim Ferriss: The why is I wanted to imbue someone else’s experience with the magic I felt playing D&D. Elan Lee: Well said. Tim Ferriss: That’s it. Or much easier games, right? It’s such a simple game. I used to play Sorry and Monopoly. And as a young kid, I just thought Sorry was the most hilarious thing when you could look someone in the eyes and go, “Sorry,” and knock their stuff off the board. I didn’t always respond well when it happened to me. It doesn’t have to be the incredibly immersive, complex game that D&D is, although I still think that is just like Gary Gygax and the team way back in the day, holy cow. Also, by the way, for people who don’t know, Gen Con, huge convention, started out around Lake Geneva and was, I believe, created by the TSR guys way back in the day. Elan Lee: I believe that’s right. Yeah. Yeah, Gen Con from Lake Geneva and then was the Generals Convention, and now is nothing. Now Gen Con doesn’t stand for anything because it’s in Indianapolis. But anyway, sorry. It was an aside. Tim Ferriss: It’s an aside. So that was the kind of impetus behind wanting to make a game, but it didn’t have any form. And then I suppose it was maybe two and a half, three years ago, I was like, “Okay, I’d like to actually take a deeper dive here.” Because there are lots of things we have on our, say, list of New Year’s resolutions. For instance, for a long time I had “Develop the side splits like Jean-Claude Van Damme.” Never happened, but it was there every fucking year and it just got punted. I was like, “Well, didn’t do it. Okay, this year is the year.” But there was no plan, there were no deadlines, there were no constraints, which is the power of constraints, which we’ll probably talk about. Elan Lee: Absolutely, yes. Tim Ferriss: It is so critical. It’s not just critical. It is additive to have constraints, which seems like a contradiction, but it’s not. Well, we’ll, I’m sure, get to that. So I started looking at different options and the catalyst for this actually was something way back in the day, some of you will remember called The Legend of CØCKPUNCH, and that was an NFT project — remember those? Which raised two million bucks for fundamental science and mechanistic studies basically related to mental health. So all the proceeds from that, if you want to look it up, it’s easy to find Legend of CØCKPUNCH. But all the proceeds went to a nonprofit foundation, which then funds mental health, therapeutic research and things related to that. But in the process of doing that, I got to, with very low stakes because I think it’s helpful when possible, especially if you’re an intrepid beginner wading into unfamiliar creative waters, make the stakes super, super low, right? And even before this podcast, it’s like, “Okay, this is a very unusual conversation where it’s like, “Look, we’re not doing this live. If we really don’t like it, we can scrap the whole thing.” So reduce, reduce, reduce the pressure and the stakes until you can get started, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: With writing, I got the advice long ago, two crappy pages per day. That’s it. Elan Lee: Love it. Tim Ferriss: And then you actually put pen to paper. Elan Lee: Yeah, the overlaps are enormous with games. But, yeah, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. Super related. Also the iterative process. All right, so using The Legend of CØCKPUNCH as this pretext, basically I started writing fiction and so I wrote these very, very, it turned out to be very involved, very viable fantasy histories and pieces, tying all of these greater houses together and then having these protagonists, the father and then the son, who’s Tyrolean, and yada, yada, yada, yada. And I still think there might be something there, but in the process of creating that, I thought to myself, “This would actually make a fantastic game. And it wouldn’t have to be as complicated as D&D, but you would have allies, you would have age old amenities, would have different strengths, certain strengths that cancel out other strengths, weaknesses that can be taken advantage of.” And that led me to start listening to a podcast called Think Like a Game Designer with Justin Gary, which is outstanding. I recommend people check it out. And a lot of the focus there, not entirely, but a lot of the focus there was on trading card games, alternately called collectible card games, I guess. Wizards of the Coast who created Magic: The Gathering, patented and trademarked one of them. So they seem to be used interchangeably. But Justin, also former high-level competitive Magic: The Gathering player, has a lot of knowledge around that world. He’s developed some incredibly successful games in that genre where you’re building a deck, you’re buying certain cards or decks with the hopes of getting certain cards and assembling your toolkit basically. And that was initially where my mind went in terms of game concept. But I realized a few things really quickly. I was a D&D guy, which predated Magic: The Gathering. My brother was a Magic: The Gathering guy. But I’ve never really played Magic. And when I began to delve into it, I was like, “You know what? I would like to think of this as D&D light, but this is incredibly nuanced.” Right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: To be good at this — Elan Lee: Oh, for sure, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — it is incredibly nuanced. And also if you’re against someone who is really experienced or just has their mind wired for it, you are going to be obliterated. Elan Lee: Absolutely right. Tim Ferriss: And that’s what happened to me playing a friend of mine, kudos to Mike, just got slayed. And God bless Mike, he’s like a number of my friends who just kind of want to watch you die slowly in this agonizing ill-fated gameplay where you’re kind of whimpering along until they put you out of your misery. Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah, you play a card, he said, “Isn’t this cute? You think you’ve got it. Watch this.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which is just not really my thing. So I thought to myself, okay, looking at some of the casual games I really like, there is an opportunity, and this will come back later, for the underdog or the person who is behind to win. So there’s an element, it is skill-based, but there’s an element of chance and this is going to come back. So then Poetry for Neanderthals, I don’t know how I found it initially, frankly. I think I probably went into a game shop and I was like, “Hey,” and this relates to why, as an adult, I want to spend less time in front of screens and ultimately if I look back and do this thing every year called a past year review, people can find it online, you can read all about it and do it yourself. You don’t have to buy anything, past year review. Where I look at the peak positive and negative emotional experiences of the past year, I go through my whole calendar. Sometimes I’ll go through my photos, sometimes I’ll go through my text messages or my sent folder in the inbox. And lo and behold, and this is not a revelation for some people, but the activities did not matter as much as the people. So then the question is, how do I create different contexts for interacting with, let’s just say, my 10 or 15 closest friends? Some of that is doing things outside in the wilderness that are active and so on. But that’s a heavy lift, that’s a heavier lift than — Elan Lee: A high barrier of entry. Tim Ferriss: — playing a casual game, right? So it’s like if I’m here in Austin, where we are right now, and my friends or a bunch of my friends come in for South by Southwest and I manage to get them together for one night, what can we play that will get us off of our goddamn phones and deepen our relationship and create memories that we can hold onto that will stick around? That’s it. That’s it, right? Elan Lee: So good. Tim Ferriss: And then we had our conversation and that’s kind of when everything, I guess, kicked off. Just a couple of things maybe that we should mention also. After our conversation when, I think, very shyly I must have reached out to you at some point shortly thereafter, and I was kind of like, “Hey, guy, not sure if this would be interesting, but maybe kind of sort, do you want to talk about maybe making a game together or something?” Elan Lee: I remember this exact conversation. It’s like asking me out on a first date. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, yeah, like scratching my head looking at the ground. And that’s how the whole thing got kicked off. And I want to mention something related to that, which was for the last probably three years, my New Year’s resolutions have been very — they’re very broad, but they’re pretty specific. So I had two. One is doing more delegation, which is figure it out delegation. So what that means is rather than doing what I’m hardwired to do with my OCD and perfectionism, which is, “Here, go do this thing. Let me give you a 20-page installation manual explaining exactly what to do,” versus, “Here’s roughly what I want done. Just figure it out and get it done. I don’t want to make any decisions, So don’t come back to me with 12 options. Just make the best you can.” And I’ll expect Reid Hoffman also, LinkedIn has mentioned this sort of a 10 percent footfall rate, like 10 percent of the time something’s going to go sideways and that’s fine in the interest of reducing decision fatigue and making things faster. So one was more figure it out delegation and number two was sprints with creatives. And for me what that meant as someone who has operated as a lone wolf, which by the way is a contradiction in terms, but who has been a solo operator for most of my creative projects, I was like, “You know what? It just isn’t that fun anymore to do it solo.” And it’s also antithetical to some of the creative projects I want to pursue like a game. I mean, there are some amazing solo game designers. Not to say there aren’t, but I was like, “You know what? I want to try to be more social in my creativity and collaborate with creatives and do sprints.” Now, sometimes those sprints turn into longer things, but those have been sort of my two guiding lights for the last few years, which is what then gave me the ability to build up the courage. It sounds so ridiculous to say, but to actually reach out to you and be like, “Hey, do you want to actually just bat around the possibility of something?” Elan Lee: So from my perspective, that conversation, I got very excited to work with you on something, one, because it turns out you’re just a lovely human being and so much fun to hang out with. Tim Ferriss: Thank you. Elan Lee: But two, I asked you that very fundamental question. You said, “Hey, do you want to build a game?” And I said, “Why do you want to build a game?” And your answer was almost identical to what you just related. You talked about your past experiences, you talked about childhood memories of games, you talked about what you like and what you don’t like. And what became very clear to me was there’s something special going on here. Tim wants to treat his friends and his audience to something extraordinary. And we get approached all the time by people who want to make games, big celebrities and singers and actors, all of them want to make a game. And whenever I ask them the question “Why?” the answer is invariably, “Because my agent told me to,” or, “Because I think I can make money,” or really very superficial. Often they’re not game players at all. They have no connection to the experience of game design. And when I spoke to you, none of that was present. Instead it was, “This is a very personal thing to me, and ultimately I want to give a gift.” And that’s when my brain started lighting up. It’s like, “Oh, this is going to be fun. He’s in this for all the reasons I’m in this and that means we can make something very special together.” And I think we have. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, we definitely have. And another question that is sometimes a little tricky to apply, but that has been in my mind for a while, since Seth Godin, very well-known author, thinker, just incredibly sage and awesome human being. He reframed for me, which is the reframing of the question, “What would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail?” Right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: That’s a good question. Like what would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail? All right, that’s freeing. But the way he tweaks that is he said, “What would you do if you knew you would fail?” In other words, like, what would you do for which the process alone would make it worth it? And for me, because I mean, we became fast friends very quickly, and I was like, “Okay, that’s rare for me as an adult, number one.” And I’ve been banging this around in my own little head for so long. Even if this ends up not making the cut for whatever reason, this seems worth it to me, right? Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Because coming back to the people over activities also, I was like, “Love hanging out with Elan and connecting. I am going to learn a lot.” And at the very worst, I learn a lot and we’ve deepened our relationship. And that stuff just snowballs over time. It transcends a single project. So even if this had not manifested, it would’ve been worth it and that’s how I try to pick my projects these days. Elan Lee: So when we first started down this path together, I remember I came out, we sort of visited each other back and forth a few times. And I remember every time I would pack a suitcase full of games and we would sit with some of your friends and we’d play games all night long and you’d say, “I like this one. I don’t like this one. I like this part.” But ultimately, we weren’t making any progress. We were just learning vocabulary, essentially. And I would go home and my wife would be like, “How’d it go? What did you learn? Are you going to make a game together?” And I’d be like, “I don’t know. No, we just hung out and had fun.” And she’d be like, “Wasn’t that a huge disappointment? You traveled 2,000 miles to go see him?” I’m like, “No, it was just fun. Nah, I’m not disappointed at all. We’ll just do it again next month and we’ll see how it goes.” And we did that five or six times. And I remember walking away from each one just thinking, same thing, “If this goes nowhere, I’m having so much fun.” That’s so rare. Tim Ferriss: It is rare. And if you can orient your life or professional life, and look, I’m not saying this is possible for everyone, but it’s to some extent more possible than people realize. You might not be able to run out and invite Elan on your podcast and then awkwardly approach him like a sheepish 12-year-old boy to ask him on a date. But taking the lens of picking projects based on creating or deepening relationships and learning/developing skills, if you just do that over time, it is almost inevitable that you will win, whatever winning means to you. Elan Lee: Yeah, value the process, yeah. Tim Ferriss: So let’s talk a little bit about the origin story. Now, I’ll throw out a couple of things here and we’re going to talk about the game development, and then we’re also going to talk about how to sell this thing. How does that work? Elan Lee: And it’s worth saying, designing a game, I remember you asked me this early on. You started out from the, “Hey, let’s design a game,” and then we’re basically done. And I remember really forcing myself to think through this process because I wanted to explain it to you. “No, that’s half of it. The other half is selling the game. And just as much work goes into that. And if you’re not willing to do it or if you have no mechanism by which you can do it, might as well not design the game because one without the other, useless.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. So it depends on the scale you’re going after, right? If you want to make something for your friends, you can do that. Elan Lee: Sure, Yeah, okay. Fair enough. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But in this particular case, I mean — Elan Lee: You wanted to make something cool and share it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I wanted to share. I wanted to share it. So that kind of dictated parts of the process that we needed to weigh really heavily. So the game development process, I mean, we started off looking at the possibilities of modifying existing games, right? So looking at, say, Poetry for Neanderthals — Elan Lee: Poetry, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — with an alternate set of rules or a different deck plus A, B, or C. We looked at prototype games that you alluded to earlier, bringing the suitcase, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So we did that all over the country. Elan Lee: Yeah, I showed up, I remember. So I have this notebook of game ideas three, 400 in there, and I add more every month. And I remember I picked my favorites, like five or six of them, and I would show up with just the jankiest prototypes. Like, “Here’s something I scribbled on a few cards.” I took some dice and I rubbed out the little nubs on the dice and hand wrote something on all the die faces. “Instead, let’s try playing this weird game.” And you were very patient and you had a lot of vision, thankfully, to look at these just horrible, very hastily created prototypes and say, not, “This is no fun, let’s move on.” But you would always say, “Oh, I like this. I like the — that moment where we had a conversation about what you were going to do next. I like that part. I didn’t like the rest of it, but I like that part.” And that astute sense of notes, really thoughtful and forward moving notes was ultimately what guided our conversation. Because then the next time, I don’t have to pick from 400 games to bring. Now I know, “Okay, this cooperative thing, he liked that conversation aspect. There’s only six games I’ve got like that. Let me bring those six and we’ll refine it even farther.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, totally. So we can talk about the Toronto trip. The Toronto project. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: That is where things started to gel. Because we’d had a number of these meetings around the country where we would do a one to three day sprint of testing, take all these notes and we’d done a few of these and we’ve both got a lot going on and your wife would ask you how it went and you’re like, “Well, I’m not really sure. I think we had fun, but no game as of yet.” And so we scheduled time. I was going to fly to Toronto to do a sprint. You were going to bring in an expert game designer, sort of game mechanic specialist — Elan Lee: Ken Gruhl, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — Ken. And it was like, “Okay, this is the trip. If we make it happen, great. If not, we’re just going to call spade a spade.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: We were circling around this thing but not really getting it done. Elan Lee: It was like meeting number eight or nine at that point. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah, we tried a lot. And it was during that trip that the very primitive sort of germ of an idea started to resonate, which ended up being Coyote. And I remember a few things, and thank God also for Ken’s apparent photographic memory with the way things transpired, but we’re walking around all over the place in Toronto, the three of us, just spitballing. Then it starts to rain and we seek shelter. We failed twice, I think, with various coffee shops. Elan Lee: Yeah, can’t get in. Tim Ferriss: No room, no seats, whatever it might be. End up sitting in this weird kind of multipurpose building. And I remember where we were sitting and we played, I guess in English it’s Hanabi. Elan Lee: Hanabi. Tim Ferriss: Hanabi, which is Hanabi in Japanese, which is fireworks. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And hana’s flower. Bi in this case is fire. So it’s like flower fire. That’s Hanabi. Elan Lee: For everybody out there, if you haven’t played Hanabi, go try this game. It is very special. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So we played that game, kind of killing time, giving it a shot, because you guys had mentioned it. And I was like, “Okay, this is a very elegant game.” And from that, liked the cooperative aspect. So when people think game, I think most folks are more familiar, maybe exclusively familiar, with the sort of winner-takes-all or team-versus-team competitive type of game. But I really enjoyed, and I’d seen this in other ways in different capacities, but the cooperative option and the cooperative aspect of this. So that then gets stuck in the mind and the rain clears up. We go for a walk by the water. And I remember we were sort of — well, I’ll own it, I was kind of stalled. I’ll be the kind of hair plugging the drain in the bathtub. Because I was trying to search my mind for game examples. But I was thinking tabletop games because that was the canvas we were painting upon. And we’re walking, we’re walking. We’ve had quite a bit of caffeine by this point and it was either you or Ken, I think it was you, who asked, “Well, just broadly speaking, any kind of game, what games have you really enjoyed?” And that’s where Rock, Paper, Scissors came up, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Rochambeau. And I just — as dumb as it might sound, and I said this at the time, I was like, “I love Rock, Paper, Scissors.” Especially when you play over an extended period of time with friends, maybe there’s some alcohol involved or not, you don’t need to have it involved. But you start to pick up tells, you start to pick up patterns, and it’s actually very, very fun. Elan Lee: So it’s important to note, the moment you bring up Rock, Paper, Scissors in any game design discussion, that’s usually the end of the conversation, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Because there’s nothing to that game. There’s three tools, deploy a tool, determine a winner, you’re done. It is only when you say, “Let’s acknowledge Rock, Paper, Scissors is no fun unless you play multiple times.” Because now we’ve made a very important transition. We’re not playing the game anymore, we’re playing each other. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Right? Because I know what you did last time. You think I’m going to throw scissors again. And now we’re playing each other. Yes, rock, paper, scissors are the tools by which we’re playing each other, but suddenly we’re playing a very different game and it starts — it cannot start in round one. It starts in round two and it moves forward from there. And once we started having that discussion, things started to get really interesting. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, things got interesting. And do you want to show the prototype deck? Elan Lee: Yeah, I’ll show. Tim Ferriss: And part of the reason I want to show this prototype deck, and we’ll describe it for people who aren’t watching, is quick and dirty is the fucking way to go. And I will just make another recommendation for Stephen Key. So Stephen Key has a book called the One Simple Idea, which is about licensing and creating inventions. He’s got a number of books now. But Stephen has made a gajillion dollars creating games for all the biggies that you can possibly think of. And he uses construction paper and glue you would find in a second grade class and a handful of markers. Elan Lee: Love it. This is already my — Tim Ferriss: And this is by and large, that is how he creates these amazing — now, when I say — they can be games, they can be toys. He’s pretty broad spectrum. But it might be a new way to play basketball, shooting dirty laundry into a hamper, right? Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: Something like that. And he prototypes these things incredibly quickly. And for him, for what he does, that is enough. He is able to put together a pitch, he’s able to sell it and he’s able to develop these amazing passive income streams with these annuities that just come in — Elan Lee: So good. Tim Ferriss: — from all these different places. But that relates to what we’re looking at. Elan Lee: Okay. I love that we have not even described what Coyote is yet. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. Elan Lee: But that’s okay because it’s more fun I think, to walk — I think the value of this conversation is to actually talk through the creative process and talk through — I think a lot of people want to make games, this is how you do it. And we went through this two-year journey and we arrived at a very happy outcome. So I’m excited to talk about, “Well, let me show you the very ugly, very first deck we ever built.” So we had this conversation about Rock, Paper, Scissors, and I knew there was something there because we were talking about players playing — my fundamental premise behind all game design is games should not be entertaining. Games should make the players entertaining. And suddenly, when you said, “Rock, Paper, Scissors over time,” I was like, “Oh, that’s perfect.” But three tools, rock, paper and scissors, not a very robust tool set. We can’t really play a game that way. So I ran home and started scribbling on cards. These are just blank cards. I took Sharpies, I buy these by the thousands on Amazon. So I had a ton of these and we just started scribbling. And so we made a card that says rock, and we made a card that says paper, and we made a card that says scissors. And we thought, “What if we’re all on the same team? But what if these cards here are not tools to fight with each other? What if these are a challenge that we have to all solve together?” And so we started just putting down a bunch of things, rock, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper. And we’re like, “All right, we’ll sit around the table and we’ll all just do this pattern. Everyone do scissors. Now everyone do paper. Now everyone do rock.” Tim Ferriss: And we’d been talking about these different variations and ideas on the walk and then we ended up back at your dining room table — Elan Lee: Yeah, that’s right. Tim Ferriss: — with tons — Elan Lee: Seriously scribbling. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, scribbling and modifying cards as we went. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly. So now the modifiers are really the most interesting thing. Because the game that I’m describing right now is useless. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: We can all do scissors and then all do paper. Who cares, right? There’s nothing here. But now we have a baseline. We’re all going to do this thing. Cool, easy. And then we started doing these modifiers, all players do all blue cards. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: So we start scribbling rock, paper, scissors in different colors, and then we’ve got this modifier. So now everyone’s going to — sorry, I’m going to do scissors, but then we’re all going to do paper and then back to you just doing rock, and things like that. And so then it was like, “Okay, well, skip a player after every red card. Okay, shout every blue card,” right? Then we just started writing all these crazy modifiers. I’m just putting all these cards all over the table because the challenge got more and more interesting. And then it was like, “Okay, so something interesting is possible here. Now what if instead of just splashing cards all over the paper, what if we were responsible for this? What if one at a time everyone had to add a new card to the table to make this challenge harder and harder and harder?” And that’s when we started talking about the vocabulary of this game. What are these cards? What makes this thing harder? Rock and paper and scissors very quickly got eliminated from the game because they’re so boring. So we started talking about, “Well, okay, what if you’re making a peace sign?” And then you came up with, “Well, what if you pose a ballerina on a card? And what if you slap the shoulder or the person next to you on a card? And what if you have to — ” I remember one of our earliest notes was, “Eliminate all shouting cards,” because that was no fun at all. Tim Ferriss: We tested that. And then that got all old real quick. Elan Lee: Right, exactly. Tim Ferriss: And also as we’re play testing, right? As we’re inventing mechanics and testing different things. So we play for a few rounds being like, “Okay, that was okay, but what do you guys think of this?” “Okay, we like this aspect.” “Great, let’s make four more of those cards of different colors.” And then we played again. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And then we played again. And then we’d iterate and we played again. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: And we ended up with, I mean, spreadsheets full of different cards. And this is all still now in cooperative mode at that point. Elan Lee: All in cooperative mode. Tim Ferriss: And — Elan Lee: But over the next week, I would say we designed 80 percent of the game. We were at this stalled-at-one-percent mode for months. And then in a matter of days, 80 percent done. Because we found this every time we played some version of this, the immediate answer when we were done playing was, “Let’s go again.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So is that the litmus test for you? Elan Lee: For sure. Tim Ferriss: I mean in terms of the indicators that something is worth further development, right? Elan Lee: Yeah,. Tim Ferriss: Because you have 400 in your notebook and so you’re not going to develop all of those. What are some of the — could be a water feel that you have, but what are some of the indicators where you’re like, “Oh, okay.” Elan Lee: So there’s two things to talk about here. Certainly “Let’s play again” is a great one, but to set your mind in a place where you’re willing to say, “Imagine this, but tweaked, but something a little different.” There’s this principle I love called the zero effect. Zero effect. Tim Ferriss: Zero effect? Elan Lee: Yeah, zero effect. It’s from a movie, I think, in the late ’80s, early ’90s, somewhere around there called Zero Effect. And there’s this one scene where they explain what the zero effect is. And it is as follows, if you’ve lost your car keys and you’re looking for your car keys, here you are in your living room, you’re looking for car keys, the chances of you finding your car keys are very low because there’s so many things in this room that are not your car keys. So your chances of finding that one thing very, very low. If instead you are trying to find anything, your chances of success are suddenly at a hundred percent. You will find something, as long as you don’t care what it is that you found. That’s my favorite premise for brainstorming and for early testing. Don’t lock in your head, “I’m looking for this particular thing. I must find X. I must find X.” Because the chances that you’re going to find that thing are almost non-existent. But if you can keep your brain open and say, “I’m just looking for something. I don’t care what it is, something, anything, and I’ll tweak it later, I’ll play with it later. I’ll find some way to consider this thing I found my car keys.” As long as you’re willing to make that leap, brainstorming becomes a pleasure. Tim Ferriss: And does that take the form of, “What if, blah?” “What if we blah?” “What if this card did blah?” Elan Lee: Precisely. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Is it a series of what ifs? Elan Lee: And you’re not scared for all of those to fail, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Because you can come up with those all day long. And that’s what we did, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: Over the next few days, that process, “What if, blah. Let’s try it. What if, blah, let’s try it. What if, whatever, let’s try it.” And as long as the answer is always, “Let’s try it,” you will a hundred percent find what you’re looking for. Tim Ferriss: All right, so let’s make some recommendations for people listening or watching. What books or resources would you recommend for people who are interested in game development? Now, I want to reiterate also, whether you think you’re playing games or not, you’re already playing games in life. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So for me, this is a way of putting on a table what we’ve already implicitly agreed to in our own lives in ways that we generally don’t realize, which is we’re all playing games. Now what does that mean? That means that beyond Maslow’s basic rungs on the ladder, shelter, warmth, food, et cetera, at some point, particularly as adults, maybe it’s before you go to school, maybe it’s when you’re in college, but you have decided to play or you have just ended up drafting into a game with certain rules, certain conditions for winning or losing certain ranking mechanisms. And step number one is figuring out what games you’re playing. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So I would suggest that learning about building games helps you to put on x-ray vision glasses, where you start to see the world is comprised of tons of games. Elan Lee: Yeah, it’s so true. And you start to dive deeper into game theory. What is the prisoner’s dilemma? What is a zero sum game? If you can start to identify those very fundamental game design concepts in the real world, you can jump to the end of a conversation so much faster. You can avoid so many missteps because everything follows, within reason, everything follows game design principles because this practice, this art form has been so well studied and so well researched and so well documented that you get to take advantage of all of that. And I love that. I use that for my relationships. I use that as playing with my kids. I use that at work all the time. It’s just there’s these fundamental principles of game design. And I’ll talk about a book I’d love that illustrates them. But, yeah, they can be applied to anything. You’re right, you’re playing a game all the time. And the first step is to be aware that you are playing a game. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: All right, so I’ve got two books. Tim Ferriss: Let’s hear it. Elan Lee: One is, let’s see, A Theory of Fun by Raph Koster. Raph Koster? Raph Koster? R-A-P-H, Raph. It’ll outline all these fundamentals. It is the first game design book I ever read. It is the one I go back to and refer to the most often. It’s just got everything and the author is brilliant and go read that book. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: The second one is going to be a little controversial. Tim Ferriss: Memoirs of a Geisha? Elan Lee: It’s called Don’t Shoot the Dog. Tim Ferriss: Oh, this is an exceptional book. Elan Lee: Exceptional book. It is by Karen Pryor. Tim Ferriss: It is not explicitly about game design, at all. Elan Lee: It is not at all about game design. But here’s the thing, this book, the fundamental premise of this book is you are trying to teach a companion, a dog, to behave in a certain way. And the answer to how best to do that is not to, when things go wrong at least, not to blame the dog, is to fundamentally change the way you operate and the way you convey information and the way you look at the world in order to better relate to your dog and to the way that the dog understands and sees the world. It is the best game design principle I have ever encountered in my life. And true, it has nothing to do with game design, but when you’re designing a game, you’re designing it for a target, for someone who isn’t you and you’re not even going to be in the room when they encounter it. And to have in your brain from the very first step, “Every problem that comes up is my problem, not theirs. Every responsibility is my responsibility, not theirs.” And if you can get that in your head and design games that way, those are the games I have found that are the most successful. Tim Ferriss: This is Don’t Shoot the Dog, terrible title, but it is the fundamental starting point that I recommend to anyone who’s interested in dog training. And Karen Pryor is one of the popularizers of clicker training as a way of shaping behavior. I believe she had experience with marine mammals, which by the way, you can’t whack on the butt with a newspaper to punish them, so in other words, negative reinforcement. So how do you do it? You use positive reinforcement. You use clickers or whistles or different tools. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And I believe the back of the book, people will be able to fact-check this, but it basically says whether you want to get your dog to heel, your cat to stop laying on the kitchen table, or your mother-in-law to stop nagging you, the principles are all the same. And at the end of it, like you said, is this radical ownership of “It may not be your fault, but it is your responsibility.” Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: And in a lot of cases, certainly with game design and instructions and so on, it is actually your fault. If people are confused, it is your fault. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no, but it’s the best way. Before I started Exploding Kittens, I designed games for friends and I just had the hardest time. When I wasn’t in the room, people were not enjoying those games. And it was only once I read that book that I realized the fault is absolutely mine. Because I’m trying to get them to have as much fun as I want them to have and the fact that they’re not, I keep blaming them. And that’s so wrong. Tim Ferriss: So what did you do? How did you fix that? Elan Lee: There’s basically two parts. One starts with design. One says the game has to be so simple that it is almost self-correcting. And I have to strip out all complication, I have to remove all nuance. Any time I’m thinking of the rules and I say, “Okay, if this happens, then this happens, except if — ” The moment I say “except,” I’ve gone down a wrong path. I need to get rid of all of that stuff. That was the first part. And then the second part is in writing the actual instructions and figuring out how — if I’m sitting in the room, you’re going to get this game because I’m going to explain it and I’m going to be enthusiastic. And when you ask a question, I’m going to answer the question. And when you get confused, I’m going to clarify it. I can a hundred percent do that. But a piece of paper trying to do that same thing, I have to write it as if I’m in the room and I have to anticipate those questions and I have to cut them off before they come up and I have to correct behavior because I know exactly where you’re going to go off course and fix it in the instructions. And that kind of one-two punch changed my game design from like 10 percent of the people get this to 95 percent of the people get this. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, one aspect — I mean there’s so many aspects, but one aspect of this that I enjoyed was related to the instructions. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And so number one, you make it really clear in the instructions, which we both poured over ad nauseum. But reading is the worst way to learn a game. Go watch this video, QR code. So that’s number one. But if you’re going to put it into text — and I think I’m pretty good at this, but I was very impressed with your ability to identify anything that could be misunderstood or that wasn’t yet defined or that could be taken with another more broader connotation that would steer people off course. And the number of edits in that Google Doc. Elan Lee: I mean, it’s got to be in the hundreds, right? Tim Ferriss: From all of us, hundreds and hundreds of edits. Elan Lee: So the most important skill is you will write better instructions, you will convey information to people better if you can clear your mind. If you can approach any set of instructions from the perspective of the things I know I do not yet know, and the words that come out of my mouth have to not only fill my brain with the required knowledge — Tim Ferriss: I see basically beginner’s mind, right? Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Putting yourself in the place of someone who has never seen this before. Elan Lee: Exactly. And it’s so hard to do because you have this information in your head. It must be there, otherwise you’re not going to be able to explain the thing. But to back all the way up and say, “I’m just going to split my brain in two. There’s this one reading script and I know the information I have to get out, but the other half is the recipient of that script and it knows nothing.” If you can do that — and it’s so hard, it takes so much practice. If you can do that, you’re going to not only be able to design good games and write good instructions, but you’re also going to be able to just converse more effectively just out in the world in general. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. All right. You mentioned I think it was two minutes to learn, 15 minutes to play. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: What other golden or guiding tenets do you have for yourself when you’re doing game design within Exploding Kittens? Elan Lee: Oh, good question. If a component does not need to be in the game, remove it from the game. Tim Ferriss: Right. So an example of that would be we had these chits or little chips, like poker chips. Elan Lee: Like bingo chips. Tim Ferriss: Like bingo chips that we were using for lives or strikes, and turns out you don’t need that. You can use — Elan Lee: Yeah, because you’ve got a whole thing of cards right here, just use those. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You can use cards by flipping them over and using the back of the card. Elan Lee: Exactly. That’s a perfect example. Right? We have this thing where we’re like, “Hey, you know what would be fun is if everybody had a big hand of cards and we’re going to play cards and you make decisions.” I’m like, “I get that.” Most games you play, you have a hand of cards and you’re going to play a card and you’re making a decision. That’s awesome. But you know what? That’s a private moment and you reveal a card. Every game you’ve ever played. When you play UNO, you’ve got a hand of cards, you’re making a decision, you play a card, you’ve revealed what card you just played. And I remember thinking, “Is there a simpler version of that?” And it turns out there is. And the simpler version in Coyote is take some cards, put them all face up on the table, and then decide which one you’re going to pick. That’s very similar to having a deck of cards, but now it’s public. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it’s public. Elan Lee: Right? Tim Ferriss: And also when the competitive version was brought in, which is the way that I like to play, the way I would suggest people play, but you can warm up with cooperative or if you have somebody in your life or in your family who just cannot lose without creating a huge pain in the ass, then the cooperative mode is really fun. But the competitive mode then allows the group decision on which card to play potentially, although ultimately that’s individual. That has implications for cooperative when it’s public. But also for competitive. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: There are a number of tweaks made to this, but I mentioned earlier, sabotaging. So we had competitive, but different minds are wired for different games. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And so, God forbid, what happens to you is what happened to one of my employees who was play testing this, where one of the people in the group was a mathematician who also is high-level chess player if I remember correctly. Elan Lee: Oh, no. Tim Ferriss: And he just smoked everyone because he had the mind for it. Elan Lee: Yeah, of course. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So what do you do for that? Well, we ended up — and this took a lot of play testing to ultimately land on this. And I want to ask you about play testing, particularly if it’s kind of hands off the wheel and you have people playing the game without you. Elan Lee: Yeah, terrifying Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Realized — and this comes back to the underdog being able to win, not getting my ass smoked in Magic over and over again by someone who’s just got better hardwiring for it. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: And that’s where the attack cards came from. Right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So there are these attack cards in the deck, which to the simplification side, you can play in cooperative mode to modify a card. I don’t want to get too in the weeds. Elan Lee: Well, I want to give you more credit for this because I don’t think you’re taking enough credit. All right, let me phrase this a different way. So the basic premise of the game is we have a whole bunch of activities on the table, right? Ballerina, peace sign, whatever it is, thumbs up, thumbs down, smile, frown. Tim Ferriss: Lean and make a fart noise. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly, lean and make a fart noise. So we’ve got all these things that we’re all going to do. And then on top of that — Tim Ferriss: It’s a fan favorite. Elan Lee: That’s right. That’s such a good card. On top of that, we have all these modifier cards and they modify — you have to skip a player after this one, ignore this card, do this one twice. Tim Ferriss: Those are generally the Coyote cards. Elan Lee: The Coyote cards. And you had this great idea, you said, “Because some players are naturally gifted at this game, far more so than others, and because some players are going to naturally fall behind and they need a way to sabotage the first place.” If you’re in last place, you need a way to sabotage the first place player. If you’ve ever played Mario Kart, you know this feeling very well. And you said, “What if we took some of these modifiers, every time — all players have to do all the blue cards with one hand instead of two.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: But what if instead of all the blue — Tim Ferriss: Or Tyrannosaurus arms. Elan Lee: Or Tyrannosaurus arms, you have to do all your movements with Tyrannosaurus arms. What if instead of playing that on all blue cards on the table, what if you just put that, slide it right in front of another player and now only they have to do it? For every single one of their turns. You’ve put a curse on them. The last place player has attacked the first place player. And I remember thinking, “Tim, you’re like a natural game designer.” That’s such a nice moment and it’s such an easy modification. And of course my answer was, “I don’t know, let’s try it.” And then we tried it and it was glorious. And I love moments like that for two reasons. One is because you had learned at that point to speak like a game designer. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: Instead of saying, “I think we just need to sabotage people,” instead you said, “Some people are really good at this game. We have to address that. Some people are naturally bad at this game. We need to give them a tool.” And those terms, speaking in that language, armed with that vocabulary, suddenly the answer to you became so clear, like, “Here’s how we solve those problems.” That’s great. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: I guarantee you would not have been capable of that when we started this process. Tim Ferriss: No way. Yeah, no, I wouldn’t have had the — sometimes artists talk about the visual library, just the exposure to different types of artwork, different forms, different silhouettes, different structures so that they can pull from that visual library to inform whatever they’re trying to build or solve for. And it’s the same with game design, same with everything. You need to build your ABCs so you can convey what you’re trying to say in terms that are solvable, if that makes any sense. Elan Lee: Yeah. Totally. You’re a quick study too. Tim Ferriss: Helped getting the books that you recommended. All right, so I’m not going to dox my friend in question. But as long-term listeners will know, I was, in a former life, a neuroscience major and then, in the last 10 years, have funded a lot of science. I always have just had this hankering and this dream of being involved in neuroscience; it continues to this day. And in the process of building this game — and this is not how I necessarily sell it, because this is going to sound terrible, but through many experiments with different companies and so on, I’ve concluded that even though generally Americans, I’ll throw it on Americans, I’m American, say they want to be smarter, they will typically not pay for something that is designed to make them smarter unless it’s a magic pill, and then sometimes the answer is yes. But what I was hoping to also do with this game is to create something that would — and this has not been proven, there’s no randomized controlled study examining this, although that might change at some point. — is to design something that would help those players who are not good at this, or the people who are in the middle of the bell curve or the people who are good to get better. And for people who are interested in looking at some — they’re not perfect analogs, but they’re similar. People can check out the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, WCST. It’s a neurophysiological test used to assess cognitive flexibility in executive functions, particularly the ability to shift cognitive sets and learn from feedback. All right, so participants must sort cards based on an initially unknown rule, which changes after a certain number of correct sorts. Now this is not a perfect parallel because that does not, in and of itself, make for a fun game. Right? Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: So fun number one, lots of probably rank ordered like one, two, three, four, five. But could I also Trojan horse in — Elan Lee: Yeah, love it. Tim Ferriss: — cognitive training. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And I think the answer — this is from a lay perspective, and obviously I’m biased because I’m involved in every step, I’m making this thing, but I think it does the trick. And what people will notice is, and you know this too, the game starts off so easy. Elan Lee: There’s nothing to it. Tim Ferriss: And people are like, “There’s nothing to it.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And then once a modifier or two comes out, people are like, “Oh, oh, wait a second, this is getting really tricky.” And if, for instance, I’ve had lifelong insomnia, you want to sleep better, play this game before you go to bed. And by the end you will feel like you just did a workout, a full brain workout for your cognition. Elan Lee: You know what I love about that part? I learned to play the drums years and years ago, and I remember I would learn these new patterns and it was like your right hand has to do this and your left hand has to do this, and your right leg has to do this and your — and I remember thinking, “No way, no way. I can’t do that.” And you work at it and you work at it and you work at it and suddenly it starts to click, just a little bit. Like, “Oh, my right hand did the right thing.” And it’s like you can feel new neurons coming to life. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: Your brain is doing something that five minutes ago you could not do. This is the first game I’ve ever played that does that exact same thing. And I remember the first time I felt that way in a very early play test, my eyes got all wide and I was like, “There is something magical going on here. I know I’m psyching myself out, but I feel new things happening in my brain because five minutes ago I could not do this pattern and now I can. We can go all the way around the table and you can add a new card and I will still be able to do this pattern that I couldn’t do just five minutes ago.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, totally. And what’s cool as well is you get to see just how specialized certain minds are and where you might have an Achilles heel. So for instance, and this is true for some folks, we have the modifiers ranked by difficulty just so you can — because ultimately with Coyote, you’re in charge of how hard you make the game. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. That’s right. That’s right. Tim Ferriss: You are in full charge of how easy, moderate, or difficult you make it. And we didn’t even talk about how this game is designed to make you a game designer. We’ll talk about that with the blank cards. But this is a sort of creativity unlock as much as a game. That’s the intention behind it, which is part of the reason that I’m really excited to see what the hell it does when it’s released into the wild, which effectively is now. Elan Lee: That’s going to — Tim Ferriss: Now the specialization piece, I’ll just speak to that. So for instance, for me, skipping turns, skipping players, it is a blind spot. It is an Achilles heel for me. That’s true for quite a few folks. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But for other people, for instance, if we’re going around the table, most people would be familiar with “We Will Rock You.” Elan Lee: “We Will Rock You,” yeah. Tim Ferriss: So it’s like boom, boom, boom, boom. So the way you play the game is you go around is you go “Boom, boom,” and you can hit the table with your hands. You can do it with closed fists. You could probably clap it if you want, but it’s boom, boom. And then one person does the move. Like let’s take the ballet, we’re going to do a pirouette. You have to do the motion and you have to say the motion. So then these two things can be split or confused later. We want to get — Elan Lee: We’ll get to that later. Tim Ferriss: — too deep into that. And then it’s boom, boom, next person, boom, boom, next person. And it goes around. And then it just gets more and more complicated. So I remember when we were first experimenting with the modifier that said, okay, it’s now three bumps instead of two. So it’s boom, boom, boom. And then the move. And there were, I remember, I’m not going to call them out, but there’s one person who just could not do it. Elan Lee: I know. I was one of those people. My brain would start melting out of my ears at that point. I don’t know why though. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. It’s weird. It’s weird. So they’re very specific. You’ll find each person will have a super strength and a super weakness, and you’ll figure it out by playing this game. And just from a game design perspective also, I’d love to hear you talk about finding the sweet spot. I mean, we could talk about Bushnell’s law of Atari fame, the game, I’m paraphrasing here, but a good game is easy to learn and difficult to master. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But how do you, in the course of play testing, working with prototypes find the sweet spot of difficulty? Because with this game, well, through making this game, I’ve just really come to appreciate how hard it is to create a game where people experience that sweet spot. Because if you were to take Coyote and make it too easy, what a simple game to make. Elan Lee: Sure. Tim Ferriss: Right? Elan Lee: Oh, yeah. Tim Ferriss: If you wanted to make it basically impossible and not fun to play, also very easy. But to find that sweet spot on the graph is incredibly challenging. Elan Lee: Yeah. So the way I think about this is when you first encounter any game, the first thought that has to go into your brain is, “I can do that.” You hear it described, and you have to think, “I can do that.” And then you have to try the game and that has to be reinforced. The game has to say, “Yep, you can do that.” And you have to feel like, “Okay, I thought I could do it. I can do it. This is great.” But that’s only going to last a few seconds. The next thought that has to go into your brain is, “I understand the path to mastery. I understand how to get better at this.” And then the next thought is, “And I can do that too.” So you have to see the moment a modifier card comes out, or the moment any complication happens in your favorite game, it has to stop you dead in your tracks. It has to be like, “Ooh, the thing I just did to start the game and was really good at, I thought I could do it. I could do it. That’s not going to work here. I have to rethink my strategy, or I have to get better at something else.” And then those two follow-up thoughts have to show up in quick succession: “I know what I have to do and I can do that too.” And that’s really the art to me of that ramping up of game design. And you have to keep hitting that “I think I can do that”; “Yes, you can. Now you can’t anymore, but you know what you have to do and you can do that too.” And then that’s going to get blocked. And you think, “Okay, now what? Now I know what I have to do and I can do that too.” And you have to just keep hitting those two things. And it’s rinse and repeat over and over and over again. And if you can hit that, you are just holding somebody’s hand from the beginning of the game to the end of the game. And they’re going to get great at it, they’re going to achieve that sense of mastery over time. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, and if you, listening or watching, have any game that you consider simple that you enjoy, rest assured there was an absurd, absurd amount of development and testing and revising that went into it. And just to give you an example, this is by all outward appearance a very simple game. And the three to eight players you could probably play with more, 10 minutes, says age is 10 plus. I’ve seen people playing with their kids who are much younger and it’s actually hilarious and super fun. There are so many levers you can pull here. You have the action cards, which are these cute little salamander cards with the different motions and gestures and so on. You’ve got just the sheer number of cards. How many variants do you have? How many total cards do you have? How many Coyote versus attack cards? When you have a fully shuffled deck, what does that actually look like? There’s so many different variables that you have to think through. Elan Lee: Yeah. And we even set up, one of my favorite things is we’re starting to see people compete now. So we set up this page of, here are table configurations. Here’s an array of cards in exactly this order with exactly these modifiers. This one’s hard, this one’s impossible. This one is going to kill you. And we’ve started to see, the game is barely available so far, but we started to see some people try to tackle those challenges. Tim Ferriss: Oh, fun. Okay. I didn’t even know that. Elan Lee: It’s incredible. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, so where this came from also is in The 4-Hour Chef a million years ago, came out in 2012, which was actually a book about accelerated learning, confusingly. But putting that aside, there were a few recipes in that book. I think one was called Dragon Force Chaconne or something like that, which was named after this video game track that people found impossible to play on guitar. And then there was something, a La Ancienne, which was this just ludicrously complex French dish that involved fish. And I was like, okay, look, if you’ve done everything up to this point and you want to take a quantum leap forward and try something that is considered effectively impossible by most people, here you go. And so that’s what we created on this particular page. Elan Lee: I will just say, having tested all of the challenges on that page, I can do exactly one of them. The last two are so hard. Tim Ferriss: They really are. Elan Lee: And we’ve already seen someone, a table of six people succeed — Tim Ferriss: Oh, wow. Okay — Elan Lee: — at the middle one. They’ve already done it. Tim Ferriss: That’s nuts. Elan Lee: Yeah. I’ve never seen anyone do the crazy hard one. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: But it’s coming. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So people can check it out. And there may or may not be a bunch of excitement around that. So I will just say there may be incentives later to be good at this game. I will leave it at that for now. So I tell you what, we’re going to come back to some of the blank cards and we’ll talk about those features. But let’s talk about a bit more of the process of making any game. We could talk about Coyote specifically of course, because you have a process for this. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: How many games per year do you guys put out on average? Elan Lee: So it’s funny, I actually built this out as a graph. So our first year we did one, our second year we did two. Our third year we did two again. Last year we did 14. This year we’ll do 23, I think. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Elan Lee: Yeah, it’s a lot. But we’ve built this, it’s really fun, we’ve built this incredibly robust pipeline from design all the way through to testing and then sales and then marketing. And I feel obligated to just keep that pipeline full because it’s such a beautiful thing we built. So we do a lot of games. Tim Ferriss: All right, let’s get some info that we wouldn’t normally have any access to. Elan Lee: All right. Tim Ferriss: If you do an 80/20 analysis, it’s not going to be exactly 80/20, but you get where I’m going, on your best-selling games, what’s on the leaderboard? What are the top X number of games? Five, three, four, whatever the number. Elan Lee: Well, up until last year, number one, the top-selling game in the world amongst all games was Exploding Kittens. Tim Ferriss: That’s nuts, man. Elan Lee: It’s nuts. Tim Ferriss: Congratulations. Elan Lee: It makes no sense, but I’ll tell you something I’m even more proud of. It’s now number two. Number one is a game called Hurry Up Chicken Butt. Hurry Up Chicken Butt is a game I designed with my four-year-old daughter, and she did most of the design. And it is outselling Exploding Kittens. It is selling one game every four seconds. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Elan Lee: Yeah, it’s nuts. And it was designed by a four-year-old. Tim Ferriss: Okay, so we’ve got a Hurry Up Chicken Butt, Exploding Kittens. Elan Lee: Yeah. The next few spots in the global sales are constantly shifting. Everybody’s fighting for those, but we always have — our entries into that list, which are constantly shifting, Poetry for Neanderthals is usually number three. Throw Throw Burrito is usually either number five or six, and the rest are just totally random. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Okay, got it. So what has made Hurry Up Chicken Butt a success? Elan Lee: Yeah. So remember what I said, if you have the best design game in the world — Tim Ferriss: And by the way, when we spoke I think two years ago — Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: — you were just beginning to talk about this. I don’t think it had launched at that point. Elan Lee: No, it hadn’t. Yeah. Yeah. It has been an absolute rocket ship. Tim Ferriss: What are the magic ingredients? Why has it worked? Because not all games do that. Elan Lee: Yeah. No, they don’t. Tim Ferriss: And you’ve had now, with the number of games that EK, Exploding Kittens, has developed, you’ve had a chance to see a lot of different ideas come through the doors and go out the doors. Elan Lee: Yeah. Some games last a season, some games last a decade. So when I was designing games — okay, so Hurry Up Chicken Butt in particular, I wrote a list of the things I wanted that game to accomplish. And my daughter had all these ideas, “Here’s what I want to do, and you’re going to do this and you’re going to run up and jump up and down and blah.” But I had a list of things that I needed to know were in this game in order for me as a parent to buy it for my kid. And they were as follows. The game has to be as much fun for me to play as it is for my daughter. That’s a hard one. Tim Ferriss: That’s hard. Elan Lee: That killed most designs that we came up with. Number two, my daughter has to be able to beat me at this game, even though I’m not letting her win. Holy crap is that a hard one. Tim Ferriss: Yep. Elan Lee: Number three, the game cannot have any losers. It can have a winner, but it cannot have any losers. Those three were my guiding lights. It was like, I need to check off these three check boxes for this game to be good. And we worked on a hundred million designs. She’s great. She’ll just be like, “Oh, you don’t like this one? Here’s another one. You don’t like that one? Here’s another one.” And she just kept firing them off. And we finally got to this game that hit all three of those. That, as I said earlier, is only half the battle. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, that’s the necessary, but not sufficient — Elan Lee: Exactly. So now we have a game that I’m in love with, that we play every single night that she can beat me at regularly. And I am trying my absolute hardest to beat her. And this four-year-old is kicking my ass at this game. Love that. Love it. And I’m having a blast. Tim Ferriss: So this is my first time hearing about these criteria. Just for people listening, this is all new to me. Elan Lee: When my daughter got old enough to start playing games right around when she turned four, we went out and bought all these games and I just hated them. They were so boring and I hated playing. And so we just designed our own. We just made them better. And it was important for me to have that list. ‘Cause unless I know what success looks like, I’ll just stay in brainstorming mode forever. So I made that list, finally hit it, and then we entered into part two. And here my daughter has very little to do with it. Here’s where I sit down with the marketing and sales team and I was like, “What the hell are we going to call this thing?” And we went through a thousand different names. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I know the feeling. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, we did that. But once I had 10 names that I really liked, we sat down with my daughter and all her friends and I would just read them off. And there was no contest. I got to Hurry Up Chicken Butt and they’re like just laughing hysterically, jumping up and down. They didn’t even want to hear the rest of the names. I was like, okay. Sold. So that was a really nice step forward. It was like, I know I’ve got a game that’s just fire for kids. They’re just so excited about this. And the next thing was, all right, well what do we make this box look like? And I was like, I know it has to be — the game itself involves a character and a die shaker and some sound effects. It’s got all this stuff packed into this character, this chicken. And I was like, I can’t just hide that. I have to put that in a box where you can see it. And that was really hard. The difference between box design for an iPhone and a game is an iPhone will spend a hundred dollars on that box with the materials and making it beautiful. And when you open your iPhone, you take the box and you throw it away. In a game, you’ve got about 40 cents to spend on the box and it has to last forever. It sucks. The equation is totally backwards, but I needed a thing that displayed the chicken and told you it made noise and lets you shake around the die and still hold its structure as a box so that you could remove this thing, play with it, and then reinsert it into the box in a way that isn’t going to mess with the integrity of the box — its structural integrity. So that was really hard, but we finally solved that. And then — Tim Ferriss: Did you do that before or after you started testing the waters with retailers? Elan Lee: After. Tim Ferriss: After? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. I don’t want to hijack, but whenever it makes sense, I would love to know how, at what point you start testing the waters with Elan Lee: Well, we do this backwards. And when we started, you have to do it the opposite way. You have to walk into those sales pitches and you have to say, “Here’s the final product. Look how beautiful it is. You don’t have to trust us that this is going to sell. You can look at this thing and know that it’s going to sell.” For this game, luckily, because we have a really good track record, we walked in with no box. All I walked in with was a rough idea, a name scribbled on a piece of paper. And I said, “Trust me, this is going to be great. We’re going to solve everything. It’s going to be amazing.” And they said, “Okay, yeah, sold. Let’s buy it.” That comes from 10 years of pitching them hit after hit after hit. Tim Ferriss: I got it. So if it were earlier in Exploding Kittens’ existence, you go in with the finished box. Elan Lee: Yeah. They’re never taking a flyer on that. Tim Ferriss: Who creates the finished box? Do you guys create it in-house? How do you prototype something like that? Elan Lee: Yeah, we have an incredible team. We have a large scale printer. We print on actual cardboard. We have a paper folder so we can actually build the boxes. Which was an investment, that’s not off-the-shelf machinery, but it helps — okay, so look, normally whatever manufacturer you’re working with, they send you a prototype box. Because they make it and they want you to see the final product and that’s what you go into the sales meetings with. You say, “Look, here’s the box. Here’s how much it’s going to weigh. Here’s the final presentation. We’ve been working on it for a year and a half. Here it is.” I walk into those meetings like, “I got an idea, I’ve been working on it for three weeks. I want you to buy it right now. I don’t have any materials to show you.” So it’s a different kind of pitch that I’m very proud of because I’ve earned that and we haven’t ever let them down. Tim Ferriss: So in the case of Coyote, there was a lot of play testing that was done before we ended up in line review meetings. Elan Lee: Yeah. Wow. We skipped that whole part, didn’t we? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. Elan Lee: All right. Tim Ferriss: So could you talk about your secret cabal of families? Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. Secret cabal of families. I love it. All right, so — Tim Ferriss: Another chapter for your memoir. Elan Lee: Yeah, right. That’s a good title there. So, okay, so here’s how most game companies test games. If you had partnered with a different games company, here’s what your experience would’ve been like. “All right, we got a game. We really like it. It’s really fun, lots of internal testing. Everyone’s on board. We now need external testing.” And they go to these market research groups and they pull strangers in and they sit in a room with a one-way mirror and they show the game and they play the game with people they don’t know and they order in some crappy catered lunch and they play the game and then they rate it on a scale of one to 10 and they fill out this form that’s like, “Here’s what I liked and here’s what I didn’t like and here’s what I would improve.” And then you get to watch those videos and they present you back all these forms and you get to make a determination. Okay. Nobody plays games like that. You don’t play games with strangers. When was the last time you played a board game with a stranger? Tim Ferriss: Can’t even remember. Elan Lee: It doesn’t happen. Right? The testing procedure that all these other companies go through is fundamentally flawed. They’re using a resource because it’s the only resource that exists. So I sat down, that’s what we did our first time. We went through one of those companies and they gave us all the results. And I looked at these results and I was like, oh, my God, we just burned $25,000 on this thing and it’s useless. So I realized at that moment, because nothing better exists, we’re going to have to build it ourselves. So I started reaching out to, at first our Kickstarter community and then our Discord community and then our Reddit community as we grow and grow and grow and said, “Look, I got a bunch of prototypes. I need families and friends who get together regularly to play games and I’m going to mail you a free game. You don’t even have to send it back to me, it’s yours forever. You get this amazing prototype. All I ask in return is upon receiving it within 24 hours, you play the game with your friends and family and you record the session and you send me that video. And that’s it. That’s all I want in return.” And within about 12 months, we had 400 families sign up for this thing. They are called our kiddie test pilots. And they’re this incredible group of enthusiastic game players that give us the best feedback. And we don’t have them fill out a questionnaire. All we ask them at the end of the test session, we say, “Look into the camera and answer one question. The only question we care about, do you want to play again?” And we know a game is ready when everybody looks into that lens and says, “Hell, yes!” And that’s it. That’s our testing process. Tim Ferriss: What are some of the pass/fail marks or green versus red signals that you look for? In other words, I imagine the response rate could vary, but you don’t know if that’s because people are busy or if it’s the wrong time of year or maybe they looked at the game, the box, and so on and it just didn’t sell them so they didn’t play it. Elan Lee: Totally. Tim Ferriss: Is that something you pay attention to? Are the people, I’m sure I’m not the only person wondering this, if they’re part of this special VIP get free game group, are they disincentivized to say, “Hell no, I would not play this game again.” So do you get a false positive signal? Elan Lee: I see. Tim Ferriss: How do you think through what constitutes a thumbs up versus a thumb sideways versus a thumbs down? Elan Lee: Yeah. There are a lot of false positives for sure. And there’s no way I can solve that problem. We prompt them in advance. We’re like, “Look, we need honestly — this game will get great if you tell us that something’s broken with it. We need to know that.” And they’re motivated because we also send them the final version of the game. So they know that’s coming, they know a better version is coming if they help us make it better. So some of the problem is solved that way, but not all of it. So that’s why the video is so important. Tim Ferriss: So they say, “We had a great time,” and you’re watching and you’re like, they are not having a great time. Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. Look, count the number of eye rolls. Or you know a great one, they’ll take the instructions — I love this. They’ll open the instructions. And when you see that eyes go wide and they inhale. Tim Ferriss: Pull back and they’re like — Elan Lee: It’s like, “Oh, fuck.” Tim Ferriss: Instruction apnea. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Oh, God. Elan Lee: Something, that’s terrible. Right? And that’s really important. And there’s no survey in the world they can fill out that’s going to tell me that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: You need to watch the moment they see the instructions. Tim Ferriss: Because they may not even realize they’re doing it. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly. Tim Ferriss: So how are they going to report it? Elan Lee: Yeah. And that’s why the video is so important. And we have very specific instructions for the video. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, what are they? Because I’m wondering how in the hell do you review 400 videos? Elan Lee: Oh, well one, we watch them at 4X speed and two is we’ve got a whole team of people that watch them and they flag moments. They don’t even say why this moment is important. Something happened here, something happened here. I’m going to go on to the next video now. And then the next group of people will go through and look at those flags and say, “Oh, big, deep inhale. Rules confusion.” Tim Ferriss: Nerd question, what do you use software wise for flagging stuff? Elan Lee: Vimeo. Tim Ferriss: Vimeo, okay. So you have people upload their videos to Vimeo? Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: Got it. Elan Lee: Yeah, so this whole process takes months and it’s really important. And the other thing is, I’ve got 400 test families, but I’m only going to send out five games at a time. The reason is I need to collect that feedback, make changes, and send out the next batch. Otherwise, I’ve got 10 results for a version and it’s useless. I know what the next five are going to be like ’cause I saw them on the first five. Tim Ferriss: I got it. So is it then, just to state my understanding, with the kiddie test pilots, you basically have — you’re not sending out the same version to 400, 600 people at once? Elan Lee: Five at a time. Tim Ferriss: Five at a time. And then you look at that cohort and see what comes back? Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. It’s always the same stuff. Tim Ferriss: Then you tweak and then it goes out to the next group. Elan Lee: Yeah, the next five. Tim Ferriss: Over what period of time do you get a prototype to the max number who are going to receive it? Elan Lee: Usually I would say six to eight months. And we’re tweaking two things. One is we’re tweaking gameplay, but much more commonly we’re tweaking the instructions. Because gameplay has already survived internal testing. So we know the game is fun. If we know this game is fun and then we watch a video of people not having fun, chances are it’s the instructions, not the game. And so that’s what we start attacking at that moment. Tim Ferriss: Got it. What are some of the risks of internal testing? ‘Cause I’ve always wondered, for instance, when I have, as I’m doing right now, doing a bunch of writing and I have people proofreading or test reading my writing, I do not only do it with professional writers. I mean they’re very good and I know I’m very fortunate to know some amazing writers, but they’re also a little too close to the material. It’s like a travel writer who can’t stop looking at their travel experience through the lens of a writer. They have lost the ability to just travel and have fun. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So what are some of the risks, if any, of internal testing? Elan Lee: So you and I have the same instinct here. I remember when we were testing this game internally, hadn’t gone out the door yet. Tim Ferriss: This game? Elan Lee: This game, Coyote. Yeah. I remember you would say, “Hey, can you show me test results? But can you have your accounting team test it instead of your game design team?” And I remember thinking, yeah, that’s what we do. I’m not interested in the game design team’s results. So I would show you the accounting team results and I would show you the sales people, the sales team’s results, who hadn’t even ever seen the game. Our internal testing starts out with the game design team, of course, but very quickly has to move on to the other teams, specifically the other teams who have never seen the game and don’t know the background. Because those are really the only tests that we care about. So your instinct is perfect there, and I’m very happy to say you didn’t have to teach us that, we already knew that part. Tim Ferriss: I mean, if I’m teaching you anything, I don’t know what it would be other than my obsessive focus on — I’m sorry for the volume of email and the volume of text messages and the volume of everything. Elan Lee: Every single one of those made the game better. Truly. Truly. I mean, okay, look, we’ve only done, we’ve done, I think two partnerships total. Three partnerships total. We did a game with Penn Jillette of Penn & Teller. We did a game with Jeff Probst of Survivor, and now we’ve done a game with Tim Ferriss. You probably sent more notes than the other two combined. Tim Ferriss: I sent a lot of notes. Sent a lot of notes. I really had a blast with it. And I remember this moment, and I’m wondering if this happened before or after the line review meetings. I think it might’ve been afterwards, but you could place it for me because this is my first game and I don’t put my name on anything. That was part of the very, very truthful pitch. It’s not like one of, I don’t have Tim Ferriss microwave enchiladas and Tim Ferriss sneakers. And then just as an aside, I have the Tim Ferriss game. It’s like, no, no, no, I don’t put my name on anything. So I take it very, very seriously. And I think it was, tell me if I’m getting this wrong, pretty sure it was Carly, who’s amazing. Elan Lee: Carly is the president of Exploding Kittens. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Carly is incredible. And because there’s always a fear, for me at least, where it’s like, maybe internally I think it’s great, and then it gets released into the wild and then, oh, shit there’s a real problem. Like Houston, we have a problem. Elan Lee: Yeah, and you can’t take it back. Tim Ferriss: Right. So what do you do? And I remember Carly, I want to say, sent a text to me. She was in, I want to say Germany at some type of gaming convention or meeting of distributors. I don’t remember the exact context, but she said Coyote was belle of the ball. She’s like, “You would not believe we had an entire huge room full of people playing, smashing on the tables over and over and over and over again.” And I was like, whew. Elan Lee: Yeah. Isn’t that a great feeling? Tim Ferriss: Okay, here we go, LFG. Elan Lee: She sent me a video of that. So just to set the stage there, there are 2,000 people that — sorry, there’s 2,000 people at this hotel of the 25 hotels that are part of this convention. And there’s one games room and there’s 10 tables in there. And the idea is there should be a different game at every table. And everyone’s testing out the games and sampling them. And we put Coyote on one table and almost immediately people started gathering around. And so those people said, “Can we just grab another copy and we’ll just put it on the next table just so not everyone has to gather around this one table?” ‘Cause it looked so intriguing. And so they sent it to another table. And then by the time Carly sent me a video, it was at every table in the room. It was just an entire hotel playing this one game because nobody wanted to play anything else. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, wild. Elan Lee: It was so neat. It was so neat. And how gratifying? We’ve been killing ourselves on this thing. And to see an audience receive it and say, thank you for the gift. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, totally. And also, I mean, I said it to you guys and look, it says technically it says age 10 plus. So I don’t want to contradict that, but if you’re willing to modify the rules, which is something that I encourage, and we have that in the instructions, house rules, feel free to modify the rules. But I sent you guys the video of my friend’s four-year-old after she played, which was like this — Elan Lee: So good! Tim Ferriss: It was such an amazing video. And this is the first thing I’ve ever done that can include families and kids directly/ Elan Lee: Easily. Tim Ferriss: Where it’s like, four-year-old, 10-year-old is not going to have any interest or necessarily the capacity to read one of my phone books that are like 600 pages long. It’s not going to happen. So this is also so much fun to finally now that it’s kind of released into the wild to start seeing these things bubbling up that I hoped would be there. Elan Lee: It’s the reason you make a game. You want to share an experience that then the recipients get to share with those people that they love. That’s why you make a game. That’s exactly what we’ve made here. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So let’s talk about the selling process a little bit more. Because you said, there’s the game development, there’s building the game, there’s crafting the game. But there is an equally important part, which is how do you get this thing into people’s hands? And for that you need distribution. So this is going to be a callback. Remember that line review at the very beginning and then I took us on a very meandering path, but there was a point to it. How do you pitch big retailers? How does that happen? And how did you do it in the beginning of Exploding Kittens and how — I know it’s changed over time as you’ve built your track record, but nonetheless you still need to do it. And actually, here’s a data point that most people will never hear anyone talk about. What percentage of your sales are offline retail versus online? Elan Lee: Yeah. All right, we’ll start there. Yeah, we never share these numbers, but for you, Tim — Tim Ferriss: Thank you. Elan Lee: — here we go. 70 percent of our sales are in-person retail. Only 30 percent are online sales. Totally backwards than what you’d expect for almost any industry. But yeah, people like to walk into a store, they like to see and touch and feel the game and flip it over and read the back and compare it to the other games. And that’s where we sell our games. Which means not only do I need tremendous retail buy-in, those sales meetings are so important, those line reviews. But also the game has to sell itself on the shelf. When you’re walking down that games aisle, 70 percent of our audience does this. You need to look at all the game, hundreds of games, and you need to stop dead in your tracks on this one. And you need to say, “Ooh, what’s that?” And that starts at that line review, starts with getting them to say, not only are we going to commit to this game, but we’re going to put it in multiple locations. So you see it more than once. Very important. Also, we work with them to figure out the color scheme. And you and I, we did tons of surveys on the color scheme and the character and everything to stop people in their tracks. Tim Ferriss: So just a quick sidebar. I know I keep doing this, but some of you may remember, and for those who never heard it I’ll just tell you, from my very first book, 4-Hour Workweek, I used Google AdWords to test the top, let’s just call it 10 title and subtitle contenders. So I bid on keywords that were related to the subject matter in the book. And then the sponsored results, the ads were automatically split tested, like multivariate tested by Google. They will do this automatically. And then all of the URLs, I had different URLs for each title option. They just took people to an under construction page. Because I didn’t care about conversion, I cared about interest, sufficient interest click. And that is how I figured out the title. And then for the cover, back in the day, I went to Borders, which was on University Ave. in Palo Alto. And I had a counter, like you might see from a bouncer at the front of a club. And I put different covers onto a book of the same dimensions on the shelf. Elan Lee: Oh, wow. Tim Ferriss: I guess I didn’t tell you this. Under the new nonfiction. Elan Lee: Oh, my God. Tim Ferriss: And I just, during the peak hours over a couple of days, I just tracked the number of times it got picked up. Elan Lee: Oh, that’s so good. Tim Ferriss: And then I used that to determine which cover to use. Elan Lee: I love this, I love this. Tim Ferriss: Now there are better or certainly easier tools to use. So we ended up, there are a number of them, I’ll just mention a few. So we used PickFu, P-I-C-K-F-U.com. There’s also Intellivy, I-N-T-E-L-L-I-V-Y, and then there’s another one called Stickybeak also. But these allow you to do roughly the same thing, which is you can take, for instance, with this box design or any type of art, or you could probably do it with copy, many different things. You can survey people who fit a particular demographic. And so you could identify whatever the ages, the gender, if they are members of a particular service, whether they have Prime membership or this membership or that membership. You can fine slice it however you want, and then you can serve up variants. So for this coyote who you see on the cover, I’ll explain for the people, basically the box looks like a slightly enlarged box for a deck of cards and then the top of the box is this beautiful autumnal orange, almost a saffron, like Buddhist robe. Elan Lee: We spent so much time on this color. Tim Ferriss: We spent so much time on this, it is impossible to overstate how much time I spent on this and everybody spent on it. Then there’s this beautiful lime green. I remember taking photographs of particular leaves at particular times of the year with light coming through it to identify the hexadecimal or Pantone numbers for this particular grain. Elan Lee: Oh, I remember this well, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, you remember it, you remember it. And then looking at color theory and the color wheel and, oh, my God, it went on and on. But above the coyote which is in the center of the box, there is this upper portion of a cartoon coyote’s head and very much trickster. Where it ended up is there’s a little hat on the coyote, there’s an earring, there’s a wink and the snout is where it’s cut off so you don’t see the nose. And this was originally, I remember sketching this initially on a Zoom call by pen and paper and then holding it up to the Zoom call to the camera and then later sending the scan and then we worked from there. But we had variants with no hat, we had variants with no earring, we had variants with both eyes open looking to camera, so to speak, we had both eyes open looking in one direction off to the side and we were able to very quickly get a very good statistical signal on what people preferred. Elan Lee: Yes. However — Tim Ferriss: However. Elan Lee: — to your credit, when you showed me that character, I think, initially, both the coyote’s eyes were open and we had some questions about the hat and I remember asking you all these questions. “What do you think of a wink? What do you think of an earring? What do you think of a hat? What do you think of one eye closed? With both eyes closed? What do you think? What do you think?” And to your credit, your answer was always “Let’s test it. I don’t want to have an opinion about this, I do have an opinion but I don’t even want to tell you, let’s test it.” And that is such an intelligent way to approach this. And ultimately, this beautiful character that we ended up with was so clearly the winner, it wasn’t even close. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it wasn’t even close. And so we were able to get this very strong signal from thousands of people voting and, boom, here we are. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So, we were talking about the road to retail. So it’s 70 percent of your sales are in-person retail versus online. Elan Lee: Yeah, right. Tim Ferriss: And, therefore, the stakes are high for these line reviews. Elan Lee: Yeah, line reviews are a big deal. And I remember, so we really wanted to all show up in person. I remember you were trying so hard to get — our first line review was with Walmart in Bentonville, Arkansas. I remember you wanted so badly to be there and there was some scheduling conflict that just wasn’t going to let it happen. And we tried to change the date but, again, they’ve got so many meetings and you’ve got to get in in exactly this time and they couldn’t change it to anything appropriate. And I remember thinking, “Oh, we’re sunk, I don’t know how to sell this game without Tim there in the room showing how much passion he has.” And you had a great solve, you just recorded a video of all that passion and you sat down in front of the camera and you just riffed on the game. You were just like, “Here’s why I love this, here’s why this is important to me, here’s why I made this game, first time I put my name on a thing,” and you recorded this beautiful and passionate video. And I remember walking into the line review and sitting down and saying, “I have a new game. First thing I’m going to do is we’re going to play this game and I’m not going to tell you anything about it, we’re just going to play this game.” And I set up the game and, within five minutes, they’re laughing and they’re having this incredible time and they’re like, “Oh, this is amazing, this is so much fun. How are you going to sell this thing?” And I said, “I’m going to play a video for you now,” and that was it. It was that one-two punch. It was we’ve nailed game design and we’ve nailed the pitch, we know exactly who to talk to and how to talk to them. And they saw those two elements and they’re full line purchase, every single store is getting this game. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, wild, yeah. Elan Lee: That has never happened on an initial pitch for us ever. Normally, we get into a subset of stores and then, eventually, it rolls out to all the stores. This was the first time ever they said, “Whatever it takes, we need this game everywhere.” Tim Ferriss: Which is still very surreal for me and I’m so grateful, obviously, and it’s terrifying at the same time. Not going to lie, this is mister dip the toe, then one foot, then wade up to the ankles, this is just — Elan Lee: Yeah, fire hose on. Tim Ferriss: — full Monty from second zero. What are other keys to pitching in a line review? And that could also be, I’ll just offer another option, which is what are some common mistakes that people make or that you suspect people make? Elan Lee: Okay. So, the first most common mistake — Tim Ferriss: Because this could be for games but it could be for — Elan Lee: It’s for anything, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — cosmetics, it could be for anything. Elan Lee: For anything. The first question is how are you represented in that room? Remember I said they only take a certain number of meetings, it took us five years to get one of those meetings. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Elan Lee: And the way that you get the — Tim Ferriss: Even with the thunderous, crazy lightning-in-a-bottle success of Exploding Kittens? Elan Lee: They only have so many hours. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Yeah. So what you have to do instead is you find someone who already has a meeting and you hire them as your publisher and then they represent your game in their meeting. That’s how most companies do it and that’s how we did it for years. So the first problem is you have to make sure that whoever’s representing you, assuming you can’t be in the room because 99.9 percent of the people can’t, they are representing you the right way. With enough attention, they’re pitching it the right way, they’re representing it the right way, they’re saying the right words, they’re conveying the right fun. Tim Ferriss: How do you ensure that? Elan Lee: It’s a personal relationship and you — It’s just hard, it’s really hard. And to be honest, I don’t want to name names, but we went through three different publishers and I wasn’t happy with how — Tim Ferriss: How did you, this may or may not be something you can talk about, but how did you craft the deal structure such that you could take a swing and then you’re like, “Okay, swing and a miss, we’re going to go to someone else. And then swing and a miss, we’re going to go to someone else.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: How are those deals structured? Elan Lee: We got very lucky. Because our Kickstarter campaign was so through the roof, that fed into our Amazon sales immediately. And so I could go from publisher to publisher saying, “Look how many games I sold the last week, look how many I sold the week before that. This is a prestigious title that you want to represent.” And then when they wouldn’t represent me properly, wouldn’t get the right sales, couldn’t get the right deal structure in place because we also demand quite a bit as far as where the game is placed, is it in aisle, is it out of aisle, meaning is it in the game section or somewhere else. Tim Ferriss: Ankle height versus eye height. Elan Lee: Exactly, right. Those bottom shelves are like a death sentence, nobody looks down there. Can we get games at checkout where they’re selling chewing gum, can we put games there? Can we get games in the catalog? All this stuff that I wanted for our games was just not being properly represented for us. So, eventually, after our sales got high enough, I finally was able to stop doing that silly dance with these publishers and we were able to publish our own games. Tim Ferriss: Quick question. So, if I’m hearing you correctly, the success of the direct to consumer, the DTC, Kickstarter, Amazon, I should say online, those successes allowed you to dictate certain deal terms with the publishers so you had flexibility. Elan Lee: Correct. And they allow us to say you want to represent us. Because, even then, they only have a one, maybe two-hour meeting and so there’s only so many games they can pitch so how do they fill that library. Tim Ferriss: And then you get to the point where you can go and book those meetings yourself. How important was having a critical mass of SKUs? Elan Lee: Oh, it’s everything, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Because I have to imagine, if I’m a major retailer, I don’t want to have a meeting with someone who only has one thing to sell. Elan Lee: Well, that’s why we couldn’t do it at first. It was only once we had, I think, 10 games was the magic number to make it worth their while. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Okay, got it. Elan Lee: Yeah. And that takes a long time. And it’s not just 10 games, it’s 10 bestsellers. And unless you’re there, they’re just like, “Yeah, just go through a publisher. We don’t have time for — “ Tim Ferriss: Don’t have time. Elan Lee: We take 10 meetings, we don’t have time for an 11th. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. All right, so what have you learned understanding but, to the extent possible, if we can put aside the element of Exploding Kittens having and developing this incredible track record which allows you to not cut corners in a bad way but you can go in without a finished prototype of the box, et cetera. If we put that aside for the moment, what have you learned about line reviews if you look at your first outing versus — Elan Lee: Yeah. Oh, I love this. Tim Ferriss: — the more refined line reviews? Elan Lee: Yeah, okay. Tim Ferriss: And I’m spending a lot of time on this, guys, because this applies to everything. It applies to so much. You have a movie? Okay, fine, how are people going to see the movie? Yeah, you can go direct but you might want a distribution partner. What we’re talking about will apply to that pitch meeting, a lot of it. And it’s the stuff that mainstream magic is made of is figuring out how to craft these meetings. Elan Lee: Yeah. Remember you said, “Like it or not, you’re in sales?” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Here it is. This is where the rubber meets the road. Dust off your tap dancing shoes because, holy crap, these are tough. So you have to walk into that meeting and first you have to keep in mind you are their 10th meeting. Even if you’re not their 10th meeting, you’re their 10th meeting. They’re in this “I’m tired, I want to get out of this room, I’ve been at this for too long,” they’re in that mindset. So the first thing you’ve got to do is get them out of that funk. You need them to understand that this is going to be the best of the 10 meetings. And you do that with enthusiasm, you do that with props, you do that with a cool video. The stuff that can get them out of, “Oh, this isn’t like the other meetings.” Cool, that’s where you start. So we walk into the room with two of those suitcases, not the ones that fit in the overhead, the big crazy ones you have to check and they’re filled with games, the most beautiful games we’ve got. Even stuff that we’re not pitching that day, even stuff we know will never see the light of day because we’re going to set all of those up. And the basic premise is buy into this world. Exploding Kittens is not a product, it’s a whole world and you can have this world on your store shelves. And so that’s how we start and that’s a really nice way to start. Okay. Then what they’re expecting is, “Okay, pitch us a game one at a time. Pitch this, okay, you’re done. Okay, pitch the next one. Okay, you’re done. Pitch the next one.” What we do is very different. Instead of pitching a game and then pitching the next one, just like I said, for Coyote, we’re like, “Hey, we’re going to play a game.” And usually they say, “We don’t have time to play, can you just pitch it?” And I say, “No, we’re going to play a game.” Confrontation, I get it, but I force them to play the games, every single one of them. Now, I’m not going to play all the way through, I’m not going to spend 10 or 20 minutes. Tim Ferriss: All right. This might seem like a trivial detail but I don’t think it is. You in a tuxedo and a top hat for this? Are you dressed in your Sunday’s finest? Elan Lee: Oh, yeah. Oh, it’s so funny. So I learned this in my Microsoft days. If I dress up, if I wear a tuxedo, if I wear a suit, if I even wear a button-up shirt, nobody takes me seriously because I’m supposed to be the creative guy. I have to wear the creative guy uniform, I have to wear a t-shirt, I have to wear jeans, otherwise, no one looks at me. So that’s how I show up. Luckily, it’s a really comfortable uniform for me. So I force them to play and I’m there being the game’s biggest cheerleader. I don’t usually let them win, but I usually orchestrate a scenario in the game where they’re having as much fun as possible. And my goal is for them to have exactly those emotions that we talked about. When we start, I need them to think I can do that. And then, a minute in, I need them to think, “Oh, I did that. What’s next? Oh, I can do that next thing too.” And I am just crafting that. And right at the point where they’re like, “Oh, I know what the next thing is,” I pull the game away. We’re done playing, now let me tell you how we’re going to sell this game. And it’s because, at that point, they’re drooling. And I do that 10 times in a meeting and we just keep hitting that over and over. And I am very aware that the last two games I pitch are usually not going to be purchased because they’re exhausted because that roller coaster — they’ve been up and down too many times. Tim Ferriss: Right. So, you’re going to have to figure out the sequence. Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Do you start with the game you hope is going to be the big purchase? How do you sequence it? Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. We open with our shortest, easiest pitch and what that usually is an Exploding Kittens expansion. So, if I need to sell an expansion box or a new Exploding Kittens product and I know I don’t have to work very hard to sell it because they always sell, that’ll take the first spot. That just warms the waters, gets us all eased in. Tim Ferriss: A little yes momentum. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: Doesn’t hurt. Elan Lee: Yeah. The number two spot is the glory spot. Tim Ferriss: Okay, got it. Elan Lee: Whoever is there, that’s the game I’m actually pitching today. That’s where Coyote was, that’s the big thing we’re going to talk about. And then the next five are equal, it doesn’t matter what order they are, those are — usually we’ll sell all five of those. At a typical meeting, all five. What happens after that is very iffy. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Now you mentioned you play the game, you get them super excited, hopefully, they’re drooling over it and then you say, “All right, I’m going to take the game away, here’s how we’re going to sell it.” What is included in the “Here’s how we’re going to sell it?” Elan Lee: Oh, yeah, okay. So important. So this has changed over the last three years. It used to be I have to start with the box and we still — I shouldn’t say it used to be, it still is, we start with the box. “Look how beautiful this thing is,” and we do a mock-up, here’s how it looks on the shelf and it’s usually from a photograph we took that morning. We want to show you, “Hey, Target, here’s what your shelf looks like. Hey, Walmart, here’s what your shelf looks like. Here is our game right there in line.” Tim Ferriss: And I should mention, this probably goes without saying, but you are not just showing up and winging it, you guys — Elan Lee: Oh, my God. Tim Ferriss: — rehearse like you are going to be performing once in a lifetime at Carnegie Hall. Elan Lee: It is, if we screw up this meeting, our company is screwed. We don’t survive a bad meeting so, yeah, there is nothing that matters more than this. This is, arguably, 70 percent of our business this year. If we mess up this meeting, we will see a 70 percent drop. If they bought zero games, I don’t know that our company would survive that, so it’s a big deal. We rehearse constantly, we make changes constantly, we make all these props. We try to get the spot either right after breakfast or right after lunch because that’s when they’re in the best moods. All of it is orchestrated and so carefully. Who’s in the meeting? How many chairs are we going to fill? Tim Ferriss: How do you request those time slots? Because I imagine you’re not the only people who are thinking about this, right? It makes me think of the data, it’s a meta-analysis long ago looking at judges’ verdicts before or after meals and leniency, right? Elan Lee: Yeah, right. So, how do you get the right slots, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So, how do you angle for those? Elan Lee: There’s an art to that as well. So we have agents, we have representatives, one for Target and one for Walmart, and these are people who live in those cities, and they live and breathe sales with the sales rep. So, their job is — the very cynical way to say it is they’re like lobbyists but the more — Tim Ferriss: Ambassadors. Elan Lee: Ambassadors, there we go. That’s a much more appropriate way. They have been doing the job for longer than the salespeople have, longer than the buyers have. And as a result, the relationship that they have with the buyers is actually one of education because they’ve seen all the mistakes, they know where all the landmines are, they know how to avoid them. And so part of the art of getting the best meetings, of getting yourself set up the best, is to hire the best agent. Tim Ferriss: How does someone find said agents? Elan Lee: Friends of friends of friends. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: The best ones already have too many clients. You can’t work with them. Tim Ferriss: Right, the usual situation. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly. But if you have a good enough brand, if you have the right relationships, if you can talk to the right people and if you’re persistent, you can get the right agents. I actually thought we didn’t need an agent at all at first. I was like, “We can just do it, we’re going to show up the day before, we’re going to walk into these meetings,” and some very good friends of mine in the industry said, “You are an idiot, it’s just not going to work.” So we started working with agents and they’re incredible. They know the industry, they can — Tim Ferriss: Now, just to dig into that a little, why wouldn’t that work? Is it that the code of etiquette and the way everything has been set up involves those agents and, therefore, it wouldn’t work or are there other reasons why going in guns blazing without representation wouldn’t work? Elan Lee: Yeah, both. The answer is both. So the buyers are much less likely to take you seriously unless you have an agent in the room. And part of that is just because — Tim Ferriss: I guess part of it is just these fools don’t know how this is done. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: Right. They’re showing up to Downton Abbey wearing a tank top. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: And they don’t know how to use the silverware. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: Why should I trust their ability to be a good partner and actually get things done on time if they haven’t done their homework? Elan Lee: Precisely. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: And the other half is you haven’t done your homework. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: You actually don’t know, you actually don’t know how to use the silverware. When we walk into a meeting, the agent has done a year’s worth of work prepping for that meeting. They have made sure the buyers know what you’re going to pitch, how many games you’re going to pitch, what the order of the games is. They’ve made sure that the sales for the previous purchases they’ve made going into the meeting so they already have the confidence in, yes, these people are going to deliver. They’ve made sure that inventory levels are where they need to be so that a meeting doesn’t get sidetracked by them saying “This game is sold out, how did you let that happen?” So many things can go wrong that the agent is fixing before they go wrong so that the meeting stays on the rails and gets you to success. Tim Ferriss: Okay, got it. Elan Lee: It’s a full-time job and, without it — Tim Ferriss: And so that agent is the person who lobbies for the appointment after breakfast for lunch? Elan Lee: Exactly, yes. But you have to know to ask for it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, right. Elan Lee: Because your agent has other clients. They’re going to sit through maybe three, sometimes four meetings in that sell cycle and they’re going to give that prime slot to the one who asks for it. So you’ve got to know to ask for it. Here I am telling you on this podcast, it’s probably going to make my job a little bit harder for the next sales round, but so be it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. People listening need to hop through a few hoops before — Elan Lee: Yeah, fair enough, all right. Tim Ferriss: — they end up being viable competition. Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right. There’s a few other tricks that — Tim Ferriss: And we are going to come back to, if you’re just developing a game at your kitchen table, what are some of the first steps. So, we’re going to get to that. Elan Lee: Yeah, we’ll get there. Yeah, for sure. Tim Ferriss: But in the meantime, you said a couple of tricks of the trade? Elan Lee: Yeah, there’s a few more. I should be a little careful about what I say but, look — Tim Ferriss: We can always bleep things in edit later. Elan Lee: All right. So, you want to pay attention to, believe it or not, all of the retailers have color themes year by year. So you want to make sure that, when you walk into a meeting, your boxes match that color scheme, it makes it much easier for them to say yes. Tim Ferriss: Had no idea. Elan Lee: Yeah, right, I know. Because why would you? Because why would anybody, right? There’s things like those agents are given permission to read the notes from the all-hands meeting from the company so they know what the company’s priorities are. And so you want to sit down with your agent in advance and say, “Those buyers, what are they going to get promotions and raises based on this year? Is it more throughput at the store? Is it promote online sales? Is it match the color scheme?” Whatever it is, you want to make sure — Tim Ferriss: What are the incentives? Elan Lee: Yeah. And you want to make sure that, when they look at your games, they think, “Oh, I’m really trying to promote online sales this year, whoa, this game would do great on our website. And then the next game, this game would do great on our website as well.” And by the time you get to the end of the meeting they’re like, “Oh, my God, I can get a promotion if I just buy all 10 of these games.” That’s what you want them to walk away with. Tim Ferriss: All right. So, these meetings are huge, we’ve established this. A huge deal. Elan Lee: So important. Tim Ferriss: You mentioned a couple of tricks to the trade. And any other tips, tricks, learnings along the way? Elan Lee: So what happens after those meetings is also very important. Okay. So there’s two things we have to talk about. One is pricing structure and the other is marketing. Tim Ferriss: Yep. Elan Lee: So in the meeting you talk a little bit about both. You have to now include marketing. Remember I said three years ago things were different than today? Three years ago, the marketing plan that you show for your game is largely your own website. Maybe you’ve bought some TV commercials, things like billboards, product placement here and there, things like that. Today, none of that matters. All they care about is social media because that’s the only form of marketing for games that works anymore, so. Tim Ferriss: I should say also it particularly works on, and this is my understanding, on platforms like TikTok or now that other platforms have realized to avoid TikTok consuming their market share, they need to push and reward short-form video. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: Short-form video. Casual games are perfectly suited to short-form video. Elan Lee: Yeah. And the way that you build the most effective videos for those is you need to inspire, I think, two emotions. One, “I understand what those people are experiencing right now,” And two, “I would like to experience that.” And it took me forever to get to those two sentences. At first it was, “Let’s show gameplay, let’s show setup, let’s show a memorable moment. Let’s show people screaming and yelling because they’re having so much fun.” None of that matters. None of that works. “That looks like fun. I could have that much fun.” That’s it. That’s what you’re trying to show. Tim Ferriss: How does that differ from the first? Elan Lee: Um, it’s very, very focused, you want to — remember we talked about mastery early on? Tim Ferriss: Well, I also asked you guys, because we were talking about this very early on in the process, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Also, because if I’m procrastinating doing something hard, I like to talk about the marketing because it just is a lot easier for me to talk about. But I wanted to see examples of videos that had worked for any of your games. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Social posts. And so they were sent over. I was like, “Okay, I think I can deduce why this works.” Often it was one person playing the other person struggling to guess what the other person was doing and one person losing it laughing. Just inconsolably, but in the best possible way, losing it, getting the giggles out of control. Elan Lee: Okay. So I’ll tell you, one of the most effective pieces of media we have ever used was for Poetry for Neanderthals. This has like at this point, I don’t know, tens of millions of views. And all it is — oh, sorry, “Here’s how you play Poetry for Neanderthals. I have to get you, I have a secret word on this card. I have to get you to say that word. And I can only speak using single syllable words. That’s the whole game. If I mess up, someone sitting next to me has a giant inflatable neanderthal club and they get to bonk me on the head.” All right. So there’s our whole game. The best video we’ve ever seen is someone who’s trying to get a person to say the word “garage.” And we know they’re trying to get the person to say the word garage because we put that right on the screen. We show you, “Here’s the secret word, it’s garage.” And they’re just saying, “Car, go here. Car, hole, car hole. This car hole, big car hole.” And everyone’s losing it. And the poor person trying to guess is like, “What the fuck is a car hole? Glove compartment? What are you trying to say?” And then they say, “Vehicle. Multiple syllable word.” And so they get bonked on the head. Okay, here’s why that video is so effective. It’s those two senses. One is, “I see the experience they’re having. I get that.” And the secondary corollary is “I could do better than that.” Tim Ferriss: Is this the video, I think I remember seeing this. This might have been a separate video, but there’s a woman who’s the poet and then there’s the guy next to her, holding the club. Elan Lee: Yeah, so menacing. Tim Ferriss: The ax is going to drop. Yeah. And everyone’s losing it, including the guy at the back. Elan Lee: Because you look at that and you say, “I understand the rules,” immediately. “I understand the experience they’re having. I would like to have that experience.” And that’s what makes for an effective social media video. Tim Ferriss: All right, so how do you pitch that? Elan Lee: Well, we show a lot of examples and we show a track record. We say, “Look, here’s how many views our last round of videos got. Here’s how many likes, here’s how many shares, here’s how many subscriptions.” All this stuff, we show them right there in the meeting. We never had to do that. This is a brand new phenomenon. And we say, “Here’s the type of video that we’re going to craft for this new game,” and we always couch it in those two sentences. “Here’s how we’re going to explain the fun people are having and here’s how we’re going to make the audience feel like they would like to have that much fun as well.” And that’s been very effective for us. So that’s now half the meeting, because every game we start by, I demo the game. Tim Ferriss: It’s social media strategy. Elan Lee: Yes. I demo the game, I pull the game back, we talk a little bit about the pricing structure and the theme and the box and all that. And then we go right into social media strategy for that game. Because I have to spend as much time on that as I did on the game design because they’re equally important now. It’s huge. Such a difference. Tim Ferriss: All right, so for somebody listening who is thinking about making a game, and I really encourage everyone to do that, and I’m just going to flash, this is as good a time as any, just to flash these blank cards that are within every Coyote box and they are color-coded. You can use these to make action cards, which are these different gestures and actions and so on. Elan Lee: Yeah. Those are the templates that we use. Tim Ferriss: These are the templates. You can use them to make Coyote cards, these modifiers. You can use them to make the attack cards which you use to sabotage other people. There are other ways to play those cards. This is intended to invite everyone to basically create their own game by modifying the rules. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: Or adding new elements that are uniquely their own. You can have fun with your friends, you can have fun with your kids. I mean, this is intended to make you a part of the creative process, which you will be part of anyway, just by the way you play the game but this takes it to another level. And this was a really important element for me. So this will be a warm-up in a sense. You get to try game design, game development light, with these blank cards. But let’s say somebody then decides they want to give it a go, maybe it’s with one of their kids, like you did with your daughter. Maybe it’s by themselves. Who knows? Maybe it’s going to the game shop, local game shop, which I really recommend people do. If you’ve never been to a real proper game shop, go in on a game night when people are set up and also check out the games you might not be inclined to check out. So if you’re a casual gamer, go to a Warhammer night, see what that’s about. Elan Lee: Totally. Tim Ferriss: Check out these different worlds. Elan Lee: Another secret weapon is go to a game shop, find the owner, or even the person behind the counter, someone who knows what they’re talking about. And just say, “I’m looking for a game. What game do you wish more people would give a try?” And you’ll find the gems that way because they know. But maybe the game doesn’t have the best box or the best name or it fell short somewhere and people just aren’t buying it, but they know it’s amazing. That’s where you find them. It’s a great experience. Tim Ferriss: So start testing the waters in that way. It’s so easy to do in a place like Austin. I mean, this is Austin. People might think of game locations and X, Y, Z, they’re all over the place. There happens to be a really vibrant scene here. And if you wanted to, if one wanted to start developing their own game, let’s say they find something that starts to stick. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. We’ve got a tiger by the tail. This seems to be working. They’re play testing. It might take a while, like Settlers of Catan, I think Klaus Teuber had 150 versions before, that’s a complex game. But let’s say they start to develop the game and they’re like, “All right, I would like to try to sell this.” What are the options? What would you say to someone who’s like, they’re smart, they can plan, they’ve operated in the world before, so they’re not new to adulting, but they have no experience in selling games. Elan Lee: There are three paths. I’ll tell you all three paths and then I’ll tell you my favorite one. Tim Ferriss: All right. Elan Lee: Okay. Path number one, self-publishing. Self-publishing is hard, but you can print out your own decks. You can design everything yourself. You can write the rules yourself. You can do absolutely everything yourself. And then you can spend a few thousand dollars, publish a few hundred copies, and send them out to all your friends. Okay. So that’s option one. It sucks. Don’t do that one. It’s just the worst. I mean, you’re just going to make every mistake and you’re not — Tim Ferriss: And you’re going to have to pay for your mistakes. Elan Lee: And you pay for every mistake, and then once you make the mistake, now you can’t take it back and you can’t undo it. Just don’t self-publish. It’s a terrible idea. Okay, there’s number one. That’s not my favorite one. Number two is you go to an existing publisher, Hasbro, Mattel, nowadays Exploding Kittens. You can approach big publishers, pitch your game, and then strike a deal with them where they will handle all the risk, but they will also take most of the reward. You can still honestly get very rich this way, but you have to get into their portfolio, so either you need a track record or you just have to absolutely wow them or you need some other — you have to show up with some bona fides. You can’t just say, “I’m a brand new designer, here’s my brand new game, please publish me.” Tim Ferriss: How would you, maybe there are exceptions where people have wowed them, first time game designer with a game, how does one do that? Elan Lee: You go to a convention. Tim Ferriss: You go to a convention? Elan Lee: Yeah, you go to a convention, you demo your game, they will all show up. They’re like agents recruiting for a sports team. They’re going to show up to all of those places and they’re going to walk the halls and they’re going to check even the smallest booths. And they’re going to even go to the big convention halls where everyone just has their own little folding table or even a temporary folding table. They’re going to look at all of that stuff. So it is possible to do it that way, but you have to keep in mind they have very few slots open and they usually only have one or two agents, scouts looking for games. So your chances of success there are low as a first-time person, much better if you can walk in, if you can schedule a meeting and they will take that meeting and then you can say, “Here’s why you should not say no to this.” Tim Ferriss: What are the things you can do or put in a pitch that increase the likelihood of getting a meeting, outside of being an influencer with 20 million followers on Instagram? Elan Lee: Well, yeah, that helps, but the reason that helps is, what I was going to say is the ability to sell the game, whatever it is, maybe you’re an influencer — Tim Ferriss: By the way, also true of nonfiction writing. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: If you’re selling a book. Elan Lee: And for selling a screenplay and for really selling anything, you need to be able to say, “Here’s why people are going to take notice of this thing and why you would be a fool to pass on this opportunity.” That’s hard. Oftentimes the best way to do that is to have already done it, which means your first time out, you need what I’m about to talk about, which is option three. Option three, crowdfunding. This is relatively new, like 10, 15 years old. Tim Ferriss: So it is, I guess, self-publishing in a sense, but you’re getting other people to fund the development. Elan Lee: Two things, yes to that. Exactly right. Other people are funding a hundred percent of the development, which is incredible. But also you are collecting those funds on a platform that promotes the game. People are there watching your video, you’re trying to convince them. Tim Ferriss: It is a discovery platform. Elan Lee: Exactly. Perfectly phrased. It is a discovery platform that was missing 15 years ago. “Watch my self-published YouTube video and hopefully fund my game,” it just didn’t exist. So now people are looking at crowdfunding sites looking for cool new experiences and backing them. And that’s a new invention and that’s really cool. And it’s not my favorite one either. So I just said I picked my favorite and I just pitched three and I said, “None of them are my favorite.” Here’s my actual favorite. A combination of two and three. Start on crowdfunding, especially if it’s your first time out. Learn everything you can. Your first project is probably going to fail. That’s okay. You’ve got nothing at stake. You didn’t lose anything. Fix it. Relaunch it, fix it again. Relaunch it again. Take as many times as you need. There’s nothing at risk here. You’re just learning the process. Awesome. When you get a success on whatever crowdfunding platform you love, now go to those publishers and say, “Here are my bona fides. Here’s proof that this thing is going to sell. I’ve already sold this once. I’ve already gotten 10.” Tim Ferriss: Do you do that before you have shipped the game? Elan Lee: No. Very important. No. Ship the game first. If the only thing you can prove is that you are a train wreck waiting to happen, you will get nothing from them. So ship the game, show that you’re organized, even if it’s a small fulfillment like you sell a hundred copies of your game, show that you can fulfill those hundred copies and then start to show the reactions to those. If you’ve only got a hundred people who bought the game, reach out to every single one of them and beg them to record a video about how much they love your game. And now go to publishers with that. That’s really what you’re searching for. Use crowdfunding as exactly what it is, as a way to launch your new game to then take to step two. Tim Ferriss: Let me ask this. There may be people listening or watching who think to themselves, “That sounds awesome, but wasn’t the heyday of crowdfunding three, four, or five years ago?” Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: You hear less about it. Certainly for, let’s say, selling to a hundred people or maybe many, many more, I’m sure there are runaway success campaigns even today, but are there any tweaks that you would add to it? Elan Lee: It’s really tricky. Okay, so here’s what happened with crowdfunding. So we launched on Kickstarter, Exploding Kittens launched on Kickstarter, and by some amazing twist of fate, that was perfect timing. Very few people had heard of Kickstarter. They heard about this funny, silly thing. It was drawn by The Oatmeal. Matt already had this incredibly large audience and people showed up and they said, “Ooh, crowdfunding. Ooh, this thing costs 20 bucks. I’m going to back this thing.” And we had 219,000 people try that thing. Amazing. Unheard of success. Those people then over the next, let’s call it five years, stayed on Kickstarter and they backed other things, other games, other projects, whatever. And what they found was the nature of Kickstarter is such that only about 50 percent of those projects that shipped either the thing that shipped was nowhere close to the thing promised, or the thing never shipped, and they never got their money back. Whatever it is. Tim Ferriss: People got burned. Elan Lee: They got burned, and they had a terrible experience. And now when you say, “Hey, back my Kickstarter,” everyone’s got this memory implanted of, “Oh, that was a bad experience for me. Maybe I even had some great experiences, but I also had those bad ones and this is not worth it. And I’m not going back to that site or any crowdfunding site.” So that’s the problem. We’re not seeing the numbers we used to see because everyone’s walking in with this baggage and it sucks. My only advice is there is now a secondary ecosystem around Kickstarter, other websites that have gotten very good at promoting projects, that have gotten very good at advertising new offerings on Kickstarter and building trust, like if you get on this other — Tim Ferriss: So it’s like a curated site that vets projects. Elan Lee: Exactly right. And here’s the thing, those companies almost always take a percentage of what the maker gets in exchange for helping them with fulfillment, with creation, with everything. So not only are you buying into a trusted ecosystem, but you also know there’s multiple parties involved that are going to work very hard to make sure you get that product. Tim Ferriss: What are some of those companies? Elan Lee: I would have to look them up. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Yeah, no problem. All right, we’ll put maybe links to a few of them in the show notes. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. There’s a ton of them. They all have the word backer in them somewhere, backer found and backer this and backer that. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. We’ll put a couple of links in the show notes. Tim.blog/podcast, you can find it. And I will also just give a shout-out to a friend of mine who at some point you have to meet, maybe you’ve met him already. Craig Mod, does that name ring at all? Elan Lee: No. I don’t know Craig. Tim Ferriss: All right, so Craig is a gem of a human, amazing writer, also very technical as a software engineer, software development expert. And he, at one point, for his beautiful books that he has bound and crafted in Japan, these are works of art, they’re absolutely beautiful. And he created basically a, I don’t know if open source is the right term, but he does have the code available on GitHub for anybody who wants it, called, I think it’s called Craigstarter, which is effectively, if you want to host your own crowdfunding campaign and in his opinion, fix some of the bugs that were difficult to contend with. Elan Lee: Interesting. Tim Ferriss: Then boom, you can do that. Elan Lee: Oh, I love that. Tim Ferriss: And I think he incorporated Shopify and other add-ons, different services could be as modules. I’m sure I’m not using the right terminology, but incorporated into it. Elan Lee: Super clever. I love it. Tim Ferriss: So people can also check that out. And I have two interviews with Craig. You should check out both of them. They’re absolutely fantastic. Elan Lee: Lovely. Tim Ferriss: Okay, so folks can look at these services as basically a stamp of credibility. They will help not only with the promotion if you are so vetted, but with the fulfillment, like that third-party logistics. Elan Lee: That’s right. Now, I don’t think we’re going to see a crowdfunding campaign on the scale of Exploding Kittens these days. There are a few exceptions. You just interviewed one of them, in fact. Tim Ferriss: Brandon Sanderson? Elan Lee: Exactly, out of control success. Tim Ferriss: $45 million, or whatever it was, Kickstarter campaign for fantasy books. Unheard of. Elan Lee: Bonkers. Unheard of. But what I love is that that shows this is not even a remotely dead platform. Tim Ferriss: No. Elan Lee: There is success to be had here. You just have to be creative. I mean he started out with a great fan base. He picked an incredible title, the first word of his campaign was, “Surprise.” No one’s done that before. What does that mean? And just everything about it. Smart on top of smart on top of smart. I loved it. Loved it. So it’s very possible, but it’s also very rare and you have to be smart about it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Well, here’s the thing. It’s possible and who cares? It may not have the gravitational pull that it had five years ago, but if you can’t sell anything in a crowdfunding campaign, you are not going to sell any buyer at mass retail. Elan Lee: Absolutely right. Tim Ferriss: It’s not going to happen. Elan Lee: Absolutely right. Tim Ferriss: And therefore you save yourself years of banging your head against a brick wall when you’re never going to break through. If you get, and this might not sound like good news, but if it’s going to fail, you want to fail as quickly as possible. Elan Lee: It’s great news, as long as you don’t take it personally, as long as you say “This product — “ Tim Ferriss: How many games do you guys screw around with on any level? And how many make the cut? Elan Lee: We probably work on a hundred games a year and less than 20 make the cut. Tim Ferriss: And that’s with all of your experience? Elan Lee: Yeah. That’s probably way higher than it should be. I’m probably pushing forward games that have no right to be pushed forward. But again, you don’t take it personally. You say, “This game is flawed.” And the faster you can figure that out, the faster you can move on to a game that isn’t flawed. Tim Ferriss: So if I heard you correctly then, it’s crowdfunding. You establish some numbers and so on that you can share that show traction at some type, game reactions, et cetera. Then you take all of that to book a meeting at a trade show or a conference or convention with one of these publishers who already has the annual meetings and line reviews. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: And you make a pitch to do a deal with them. Elan Lee: That’s my favorite path through this. Tim Ferriss: What deal terms do you need to pay attention to? Elan Lee: Okay, so there is one very important number that you’re going to get, and it’s going to seem like a very low number, but here’s how this works. Most publishers are going to throw a number at you, like two percent. Tim Ferriss: Royalty rate? Elan Lee: Yeah. And you’re going to think, “Wait a second, I was the inventor, I get 80 percent and you’re offering me two percent?” But here’s what that number actually means. They, the publisher, are going to take on all the risk. They’re going to do all the printing, they’re going to do all the relationship management, they’re going to do that sales meeting, they’re supporting hundreds of people on their staff, they’re doing all this stuff that you are not doing. But in exchange for that, that two percent isn’t two percent of the profit, it’s two percent of the revenue. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Top line. Elan Lee: Exactly. And that is a very important distinction. That makes that two percent probably closer to 20 percent, 30 percent once you do all the math. Tim Ferriss: It’s the opposite of Hollywood accounting. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: It’s not some percentage of net income, which is defined in some Byzantine way to fuck you every which way from Sunday. Elan Lee: Precisely right. Tim Ferriss: If it’s top line — Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So just to reiterate what you just said, two percent is more like 20 plus percent? Elan Lee: Yes, that’s exactly right. Tim Ferriss: Of profit? Elan Lee: Yeah. And you can ask them to break down that math for you. You can say, “Show me the spreadsheet, show me what you’re spending, what your responsibilities are, what mine are. After all of those numbers are crunched, what is the total amount you’re going to spend on this game? Show me your total projections on what’s coming in, show me how much I’m going to make of that.” And then you can start comparing those numbers yourself and see, “Oh, of the money that came in, I’m getting 20 percent of it. Even though this number only says two percent.” Once you crunch that math, this is a pretty decent deal. And you can get higher than two percent. Usually not as a first-time developer, but I’ve seen deals anywhere from two to 12 percent on the super high end. Tim Ferriss: 12, wow. Elan Lee: You’ve got to be a rockstar because at 12 percent, now you’re at 50 percent, and that’s tough to get to. You’ve got to really pull your weight to get numbers like that. So those are what the deals look like. And then after that, then the whole relationship moves into this like, “Okay, now what the hell are we actually making? What is the quality of the cards? What are the components in the box? Are you allowed to change rules?” Tim Ferriss: Quick question, is the deal structure similar to a book publishing contract in the sense that the game developer would get an advance against sales? Or is that — Elan Lee: Sometimes. Tim Ferriss: Sometimes? Elan Lee: Yeah. You can negotiate that. I’ve seen publishers do that or not do that. I will just say for Exploding Kittens, we never do advances. Tim Ferriss: It’s fundamentally different also from, say, nonfiction book publishing in the following sense. If you’re taking a, let’s call it conventional publishing approach, which is very similar to selling the game, it’s like you have an agent. You’ve got the editors, let’s just say, and the publishers who are the buyers of sorts, the editor might be the category buyer but they have to get the okay from the publisher for signing off on deals. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: And you’ll have your royalty rate, which varies widely, but let’s just say somewhere depending on paperback versus hardcover, up to probably a maximum in conventional deals of 12 to 15 percent of cover, which is also, again, of cover. And then there’s the advance, but the critical difference that I was alluding to is typically when a nonfiction book is sold, you are selling a book proposal, which is a writing sample and a marketing plan. Elan Lee: Wow. Tim Ferriss: And if, and only if, a publisher decides to sign a contract and buy the book, do you get an advance to buy you the time so you can stop doing all of these other things to write the full book, whereas with the game, the game’s got to be ready. Elan Lee: It’s done. Yeah. Now let’s call it 90 percent done, to be fair. And usually when we take on games, we change them significantly just because there’s always a better version, and through testing, we discover it. But the reason we don’t do advances, partially, is exactly what you’re saying. You’re already done. We’re not trying to pull you off of other projects. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You don’t have to stop your nine to five. Elan Lee: Exactly. Exactly. But the other reason is because I want a partnership. I’m not here to say, “You sold us this game. Now we’re never going to talk again.” I want you here every day. I want skin in the game. We’re going to all make this better together, which is why we do so few partnerships. Tim Ferriss: Now, when you do partnerships, meaning you’re the publisher, you’re paying someone a royalty, how do you typically find those? So for instance, and I imagine a lot of it is you guys canvassing and basically asking the question that you recommended people ask the store owners, “Which game do you wish people played more often?” And then you find something that has the bones of a really good game but a piece of it is shitting the bed. There’s something that is broken and you’re like, “Oh, we can fix that broken thing.” Or do you take cold submissions? How does that work? Elan Lee: We have a form. We have a submission form on our website. We almost never find anything there. It’s hard. It’s time-consuming to go through all of them and honestly, it’s just not the highest quality. We also go to conventions. We look a little bit around there. Sometimes we find a diamond in the rough. Tim Ferriss: That’s a crowded fishing hole, right? Elan Lee: Very crowded. The most effective way are those agents. We talk to those two agents and we say, “Hey, people approach you all the time wanting you to be their agent and you have to turn a lot of them down. The ones that you feel terrible about because they’re such a good game and they just can’t get in the door, send them to us.” And that works really well. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Smart. That’s super smart. Aside from a crowdfunding campaign, what would actually cut through in a submission? Are there any ingredients outside of, here are a bunch of compelling data from a crowdfunding campaign? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Or, “Hey, I’ve designed a hundred hit games.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. There’s that. Tim Ferriss: Aside from those two, what other types of lines or elements would cut through the noise? Elan Lee: So remember I said that phrase, the way we design games is we don’t make games that are entertaining, we make games that make the players entertaining. 90 percent of the game pitches I see are attempts to be entertaining games and I just immediately dismiss them. That looks like that game is working so hard to entertain the players. I don’t care. The best games, the ones that I pay very careful attention to, are when everything you do in the game creates an interaction between two players. I’m not interested in a four-player game where all four players are playing solitaire. It’s just, who cares? I’m interested in a game where the players are playing the players and I play a card — Tim Ferriss: We tweaked a lot in Coyote based on that. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: So guiding principle. Elan Lee: And those are the best games. Those are the ones I love the most. Those are the ones I want to play over and over again. Tim Ferriss: And it could be as simple as you might, I’m saying you, the listener or viewer might remember holding your cards facing you versus having the cards available to the entire table. Elan Lee: That’s right. Because now we’re playing all together. And the card I choose, if I have a blind hand, if I have a deck of cards and I choose a card and then I play it, that is me presenting a game to the players. If I have all my available cards face up on the table and everyone can see what I choose, and everyone’s hoping I pick that first card, and I hover my hand over it and then I move to the second card instead and everyone starts groaning and then I play that second card anyway, now it’s me playing the players. And those are the best games in the world. Tim Ferriss: What are some common Achilles heels for games that have the potential to be great and huge successes? And I’m not going to mention names, but we’ve talked about a couple of games that you’ve considered buying or publishing, and I’m wondering what are some of the common weaknesses where you’re, this is a great game, but the reason it didn’t work is X or Y or Z. Elan Lee: All right, so there’s two basic places the games fall apart. One is right off the bat, their boxes suck, or the name sucks. The number of games out there called The Legendary Folklore of Gorgonzel. I can’t remember them, I don’t know what they are. I look at this — Tim Ferriss: Got to throw a CØCKPUNCH in there, and then it’s problem solved. Elan Lee: CØCKPUNCH aside, I would argue that those games, they have no chance of success. Yes, they’re going to sell 10 copies to the 10 people that bought The Legendary Tales of Gorgonzel volumes one through six, and they’re going to buy volume seven. Cool, great. I don’t care. Picking the wrong name, picking a non-descriptive name, putting a picture on the box that does not describe gameplay at all and does not provide a compelling narrative about what experience you are about to have, those games have zero chance of success. And I see that over and over and over again. You can fail right up front. And I’ve even seen the biggest publishers in the world mess this up, especially now that game shelves are so crowded and you don’t have five games to choose from, you have 500 games to choose from. And a game that doesn’t do a good job of saying, “Pick me, pick me, pick me,” you’re just not going to pick, so you will fail right there. Tim Ferriss: Or really complicated packaging too. I’ve seen that a bunch. Elan Lee: Absolutely. Tim Ferriss: Where there’s just so much going on. There’s no one dominant element. It’s like, what am I supposed to look at here? Elan Lee: Yeah, what do you look at first? Tim Ferriss: So you can’t. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: You don’t look at anything, you look at the next box. Elan Lee: It’s just noise. Just noise. We worked very hard on Coyote, on all our games, but I remember having this discussion about Coyote because this is such an important lesson. When you look at this box, we know the first thing you’re going to look at and we know the second thing you’re going to look at and we know the third thing you’re going to look at, and this is a formula, and we crafted this — Tim Ferriss: It’s a formula. Elan Lee: — very carefully. Tim Ferriss: By the way, also exactly what works in old school print advertising. Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Right? Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Header image, headline, subheading. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: Text. Elan Lee: Yeah. And those components are all present here. Tim Ferriss: And if you fuck up the order, pardon my French, the eye doesn’t know how to track or it bounces around. Elan Lee: And if there’s other better options right next door, off you go. We hit those three things on a box meticulously, and your reaction should not be, “I’m going to buy that game.” That’s not our goal. Your reaction is, “I’m going to pick up this game and I’m going to turn it over and I’m going to read the back of the box.” And now we’ve got a very different task. Now we have more real estate we can afford. We still know the first thing you’re going to look at, but now we care a little bit less about the second thing. As long as you’ve already got enough interest, you’ve already committed to picking this thing up, now you’re willing to read a little story. As long as you can see the end of that story and you know it’s not too long, you’re going to read a little story. The goal of this is now purchase. I want you to get to the end of this experience and say, “I’ve got to have it. I want this.” Tim Ferriss: And just for people who can’t see this particular visual, and there’s all sorts of stuff on the back of the card, which we won’t get into, but some people might notice interesting things on the back of the cards. The dominant element on the back of the box is how to play. And man, we worked on this a lot too, with basically three panes, step one, step two, step three. “Put cards on the table, then take turns performing them,” that’s step one. And you’ve got a little visual with the salamander action cards. Then next part is “Play cards to help or sabotage other players,” shows two examples. Elan Lee: “Sabotage” was a very carefully chosen word, by the way. Tim Ferriss: Very carefully chosen. And then the last one is “Mess up and you’re out. The last player standing wins.” That’s for competitive mode. Now, one aspect of this that I think is very clever is not sure if you should buy this game? Give us a few seconds to convince you. And then there’s a QR code. Elan Lee: Nobody does that. This is new. Tim Ferriss: I know. What’s the impetus behind this? Elan Lee: This was an idea I had that we’re demoing on this game, first time ever. My idea was “If I went to the store with you, I could convince you to buy my favorite game because I’m going to pitch the hell out of that game.” But I’m not in the store with you, so that’s a problem. My first idea was for every retail location in the world, “Will they let us install a telephone that you can pick up and talk to somebody?” And they said, “No.” My second idea was, “Can I hire a person to stand in every store and convince you to buy the game I want you to buy?” And they said, “Sort of, but you have to pay for all of that.” And I was like, “Oh, that’s not going to work.” And so this was option three. Tim Ferriss: It’s cool, it’s a lot of people. 6,000 plus people. Elan Lee: I know, right? Can you imagine? This is just a little QR code. And the idea is I can’t stand next to you for every store, but I can tell you what I would’ve said had I been standing there. And so you scan this code and it’s just a 15-second video. In this case, it’s me, Tim, saying, “Listen, you’re holding a game in your hands. It’s the greatest thing you’ll ever see. Let me try to convince you.” And it’s just a pitch. It’s just, if I were standing next to you in the store, here’s why you should buy this game. And I don’t think a lot of people are going to scan that code, to be fair. But for those who do, they’re going to have the experience of a friend telling them, “You should trust me. This is going to be great, trust me.” Tim Ferriss: And it doesn’t take up that much real estate either. It’s an easy addition to the box. Once again, test it. Right. Let’s test it. Elan Lee: Test it. And what’s the worst that can happen? Tim Ferriss: See what happens. And I also want to revisit something you mentioned earlier, which is that royalty rate, whether it’s two percent, it’s up to 12 percent in the book world. Let me take the book world and the publishing world in the book publishing sense is changing a lot, but it’s also quite consistent over time. Different things have changed, sure, audio as a format has grown tremendously and become highly prized now versus 10 years ago when I could carve out those rights, it’s a lot harder to do now if you’re going to do the conventional route. But some folks will look at the percentages and they’ll say, “Well, wait a second, max 15 percent after an escalator, I’m starting off at 12 percent for hardcover. That’s ridiculous. I wrote the whole thing, da, da, da, da, da. I want to make the lion’s share.” There are some instances where you can make that work, but I will say just a few things. When you begin, for most people, unless you are excellent at running a meticulously managed business, it’s actually pretty tough to beat those numbers. In part because you’re going to be sacrificing distribution, so the top of the funnel number is going to be different. Secondly, when you factor in paying various agents, various distributors, and all of these little costs that for you, without any scale of having a thousand skews in a department dedicated to it, you start to very quickly approach that number. Elan Lee: Very quickly. Tim Ferriss: And by the way, you’re running a real business. This is not the easiest thing in the world to do at all. And I will probably do some experiments on that side of the equation in terms of “self-publishing,” which I would put in quotation marks because it’s going to be augmented pseudo self-publishing on a few levels. But I would only have the confidence of doing that myself currently, because I’ve gone through the conventional route multiple times and I’ve also run quite a few businesses. But if you’ve never, what Stephen Key, I mentioned earlier, one simple idea for licensing, what he might call venturing, running a business, do not underestimate the value of your time and sanity also. Elan Lee: It’s so true. Tim Ferriss: Because he’s, “Hey, look, I’ll take the licensing deal, maybe I’ll negotiate the number up a little bit.” But he’s like, “I can do 12 of those a year.” Elan Lee: That’s right. That’s exactly it. Tim Ferriss: And it adds up to a lot. And I have no employees, no supply chain issues. Elan Lee: No risk. Tim Ferriss: No, “Oops, that was printed the wrong way and now I have thousands of books —” Elan Lee: You have to recall those. Oh, my God. Tim Ferriss: “— that are sitting in my garage unsold, gathering dust and mold.” Elan Lee: Let me tell you the simplest example of the difference between doing it yourself and getting help, valuing your time. Our very first game Exploding Kittens, I needed to put a barcode on the box because it has to sell in retail. I go, I’m like, I’m going to research this, this can’t be too hard. I do the research and I find this website and it’s, you’ve got to pay some little subscription, 100 bucks a year, whatever it is, and you can generate unlimited barcodes. Amazing. I generate a barcode, I put it on the box. That wasn’t so hard. Then Target’s like, “Well, this is the wrong format.” I’m like, “Okay.” I spend another 100 bucks, I get a different format bar, put it on. They’re like, “We need a different barcode based on the palette that it’s in.” And then I talk to Walmart and they’re like, “Yeah, we use a different barcode format and we need this barcode to represent whether it was picked up in China or Mexico or Poland, so you actually need three different ones. Oh, and by the way, if it’s bundled with other games, we need a fourth one. And by the way, if it ships into Arkansas, we need a fifth.” And I was just like, “Help. Oh, my God, help.” And that’s the difference. You should not get good at this. Why would you want to get good at that? Tim Ferriss: What’s funny is I was actually going to bring up the example of the UPC codes and the ISBN and all this stuff because I also went down that rabbit hole. I’m like, “How hard could it be?” Elan Lee: Right, right. Tim Ferriss: “Oh, this is easy.” And lo and behold, actually it’s a lot of brain damage. I’m not saying that no one should Venture in the sense of self-funding or self-publishing, but it is a lot harder and much more consuming than most people realize. Elan Lee: And there’s no reason, unless you want to do it for a living, there’s no reason to get good at it. There’s no upside there. Tim Ferriss: And do it for a living meaning handle those types of details. Elan Lee: Right, exactly. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Elan Lee: Anyway, we have a barcode person who does it for a living. She’s quite good. I’m so happy she’s on my team. Tim Ferriss: All right, so on the side of selling games, what else have we not touched on? Any other aspects? Elan Lee: Let’s see. Another thing I learned along the way is there’s two kinds of selling. One is everything we’ve been talking about today. And your expectation is, “I have sold you a game, the game is now your responsibility. And we’ve negotiated a price, you, the retailer, own this game now and you’re going to sell it.” The second kind is the kind that we actually engage in, which is you do own this game, but there are restrictions on how you can sell it. Tim Ferriss: Can you explain that again? When you say you own this game, you mean a retailer? Elan Lee: You, the retailer, have purchased this palette of games from me. Tim Ferriss: I get it. All right. Sorry, I was just clarifying because people might’ve heard that as you own the IP of the game. Elan Lee: Sorry, sorry, sorry. Yes. Tim Ferriss: You are buying an inventory of this game. Elan Lee: Correct. Now, what if the game doesn’t sell very well? Whose problem is that? Well, if you didn’t think that through and it’s just a straight sale, they can put it in a bargain bin or they can sell it to somebody else who’s then going to sell it. Or if you really didn’t negotiate it, they can force you to buy it back from them. The restrictions on what happens to the game, what they’re allowed to do post-sale is so meticulous and these contracts get so long. And this is another thing, you don’t want to get good at this. You just need to hire someone who has seen every imaginable mistake and knows what to argue for. And oftentimes the retailers don’t care that much about this part, especially because they have a lot of faith. This thing’s going to do well. But when it goes poorly, if it goes poorly, and we’ve had a few examples of this, what do you do next? In the case of something as simple as Amazon, Amazon has a terrible policy for returns. Namely, they will accept all returns and it is the vendor’s responsibility, my responsibility. You buy Exploding Kittens from GameKnight, you play the game, you damage all the cards because you spilled beer all over them, you put them back in the box the next day after you had a great time and you return it and now that’s my cost. And that happens hundreds of times a week. It sucks. There’s also this thing where people will buy counterfeit games and they’ll buy, then, the real version. They’ll buy a counterfeit for a dollar, they’ll buy the real version on Amazon, they’ll keep the real version, they’ll return the counterfeit and now that’s mine as well. And I just spent $20 on that stupid counterfeit version because that’s coming back to me. All of this stuff has to be thought through in advance and it’s tricky, because some retailers, the Targets and the Walmarts in the world, they are so willing to work with you on that stuff. Amazon, not so much. They’re just like, “Oh, you don’t like our policy? All right, well maybe a different platform is for you.” It’s hard. It’s really hard. Tim Ferriss: And I should say that I’ve run into, when I’ve talked about termination clauses or what do we do when everyone’s pissed off and things aren’t working? Because really that’s the only time that you’re going to go back and look at the agreement, which is why Gary Keller, famous for his real estate empire, said, “You should really call them disagreements.” The only time you’re going to look at them is when things are really going sideways. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: And there are some people I’ve spoken to about the importance of these things, like, “Wow, that’s really pessimistic.” I’m like, “No, no, no.” Let’s understand the consequences of not going through this. I know so many examples of entrepreneurs who actually had a chance at a runaway success and they did not pay attention to these terms for, say, a QVC or a huge retailer. And this could happen with Kickstarter as well, of course, they get overextended because now they have orders for God knows how much inventory that is well beyond their capacity, their experience, their financial means. And in their mind, let’s take out the Kickstarter or crowdfunding, but they don’t think about the return policy and they get the hug of death. They overextend themselves financially to produce the inventory, they ship it, and then any number of things can happen. It might be net 270 payment terms. Elan Lee: Oh, God. Tim Ferriss: It could be just — Elan Lee: So brutal. Tim Ferriss: — cash flow suicide right on the front end. And on top of that you might get all of it shipped back to you — Elan Lee: All of it. Tim Ferriss: — and it’s your problem. And then that — Elan Lee: It’s so tragic. Tim Ferriss: — is the hug of death and you’re done. Elan Lee: And then you’ve seen this, you’ve seen this picture. You have this friend whose apartment is filled with products and it’s taken over their living space and they have no way to move it. Tim Ferriss: I did that myself early on. I made an audiobook product. I was going to sell millions of this thing. Oh, my God. Didn’t do any market testing, none of that stuff, just high on my own supply. And I had an entire garage full of these things that just melted in the heat ultimately. And at the time though, that was a huge financial risk. I didn’t take so much risk that it torpedoed me, but if I had had that level of self-delusion and lack of experimentation a little later on, it very easily could have been a recipe for disaster. Elan Lee: Totally. Look, there’s so many ways to mess this up. There’s so many ways to mess this up. And the only good news is there is someone out there who has messed it up in every possible way. Tim Ferriss: Or represented people who have messed it up — Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: — in every possible way. Elan Lee: And those are the people you have to work with. You have to. If you don’t, the risk you’re taking on is just massive. Luckily, I had some very good advice early on from people who said, “Don’t take this on yourself. Just don’t do this.” And it’s the best advice I ever got. Tim Ferriss: And I think maybe tell me if this is overreaching on my part, but don’t take this on yourself now in the sense that after you’ve had 10 mega successes and you actually are fluent in retailese and you have the relationships, all right, now you can take some calculated risks. Elan Lee: And now you can hire the people that you would otherwise contract, now you can pull them in-house. Because now you can afford their salaries and now you want them to only be working on your own products. Great. That’s a huge mark of success and really that is exactly the way you reinvest in your own company. Tim Ferriss: And to reiterate just a few things, if you want to develop a game, number one, you can just develop it for your family, your friends, and keep it small. And I will just say in the book world, a lot of later mega successes have started out that way. You don’t have to go for scale, which I think can be a very dangerous word out of the gate. But as you mentioned, you can also, with the blank cards in Coyote, you can get a taste of it, see if you like it, then you can use the books that you recommended. And there are certainly other resources, we’ll put things in the show notes, to play around with prototyping. Look at these initial cards. These are blank cards with Sharpie writing on them. Elan Lee: That’s it. Tim Ferriss: That’s it. Elan Lee: That’s literally it. Tim Ferriss: That’s it, that’s the entire thing. And you can also find kits online, you can find them anywhere you want. Amazon has gaming kits where there are blank dice and cards and so on so you can workshop it. Elan Lee: Easy. It’s so easy. Tim Ferriss: It’s like Build-A-Bear for games basically. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: And what I would add to that is you don’t need to run a big business to be a successful game designer. Elan Lee: Absolutely. Tim Ferriss: In fact, I would imagine most of the legendary game designers are not running companies. Elan Lee: No, definitely not. Tim Ferriss: They’re designing games and licensing them. And man, there are some legends out there. Elan Lee: Legends. They’ve created incredible games and they’ve generated gigantic wealth for themselves because in success, that two percent deal, that five percent deal, whatever it is, that faucet doesn’t turn off, that’s in perpetuity. In summary, I don’t think the games business is going anywhere. Tim Ferriss: And also there is a lot of room to innovate. There still is room. There’s so many games, but I wouldn’t have even attempted to create a game had I not thought there was space. Elan Lee: The thing is, it’s like saying, is there still space in the book industry, in the movie industry? All a game is is an idea delivered in a new way. When are we going to run out of ideas? When are we going to run out of delivery mechanisms? The answer to both of those individually is never. Combine them both together and it’s just build games forever. You’ll always have a new way — Tim Ferriss: Option. Elan Lee: — to deliver it. Tim Ferriss: All right, so I’m trying to think of anything that we missed. I do have a tantalizing offer for listeners and viewers just for fun because why not? And we will have also mentioned that in the intro. But before I get to that, anything critical that we’ve forgotten? Is there anything that we have left out or any other resources, people to watch, maybe people to Google and Wikipedia maybe? Anything at all? Elan Lee: All right. I’ve got two. I’ve got two that are interesting. One is there is a podcast I quite like for game design, it’s called Fun Problems, it’s with Peter and AJ. And all they do is they talk about game design. Now, they do talk about more hardcore games than I am accustomed to. It’s a wide range of topics, but it’s fun stuff and it’s worth listening to if you want to know more about game design. And the second thing is, because of you. Because of you, because of this process, this journey that we’ve been on over the last few years, I realized that I don’t document any of this ever. I never talk about what goes into a game design, I never talk about where to buy blank cards, and I never talk about why anybody can do this and what the process is like. I’ve started recording it and I started for the first time, I can’t believe I’m saying this, I actually started a YouTube channel and you can actually go and watch these instructional videos. Literally if you want to make a game, the whole idea is: here is how to make a game from scratch. Nobody’s watching right now, but — Tim Ferriss: YouTube.com at Elan Lee, that’s E-L-A-N-L-E-E. You can also just search him on YouTube. The first result will be our podcast together. Elan Lee: That’s true. Tim Ferriss: Episode one. And then within the first few results, you’ll also find it. But I’m pretty sure the URL is YouTube.com/@ElanLee. And let’s finish up with a few things. The first will be the tantalizing offer that I mentioned. The tantalizing offer is this, there’s no purchase required whatsoever, so if any sweepstakes sharks are out there, take it easy, take it easy. This is going to be just a fun little, it’s not even a competition, just a fun little experiment that I want to run. *** [Interview pauses] 02:46:00 to 02:48:14 Tim Ferriss: Hi, everyone, Tim here with an update, as details have changed since that first conversation with Elan. Here’s the tantalizing offer that I wanted to share with you. You have two very easy ways to enter for a chance to win a trip to a secret Los Angeles mansion for an unforgettable day or evening with me and Elan and maybe some special guests. Here’s how. Option number one, simply visit any Target or Walmart and take a fun photo or video with a Coyote game. No purchase necessary. Option number two, if you already bought Coyote, record yourself playing the game with friends or family. That’s it. I would love to see it. Then share your photo or video on Instagram or Tik Tok or both and tag me and ExplodingKittens. You can find us easily, but I’m @TimFerris on both. That’s @ Tim F-e-r-r-i-s-s and Exploding Kittens is ExplodingKittens on Tik Tok and @GameOfKittens on Instagram. So share your photo and or video on Instagram and or Tik Tok. Put them everywhere. Why not? And tag both me and Exploding Kittens. Longtime listeners know that I have a love of deadlines. This is how things actually get done. So, the deadline to post is August 17. That means that 10:00 p.m. PDT August 17. By then, you need to have posted and done all this stuff. By August 31st, we’ll randomly select five winners from people who post. Each winner will receive roundtrip airfare within the US, one night at a hotel, and will join us at our secret LA mansion party. And I think the legal elves wanted me to mention that that’s going to be coach airfare. So, just to be super clear, important legal disclaimer. No purchase necessary. Open to US residents aged 18 or older. So no little kids, no minotaurs allowed. Void where prohibited. Winners selected at random. Odds depend on number of eligible entries. Travel dates must align with the event likely in September. We are still finalizing the time with the busiest man in show business, Elan Lee himself. For official rules, eligibility details, and final date, please visit tim.blog/rules. So, go ahead, post a creative Tik Tok or Insta real or a photo with Coyote by August 17th, 10 p.m. PDT. Tag us and you might just be celebrating with us in Hollywood this fall. Now, back to the episode. *** [Interview resumes] Tim Ferriss: What else? Anything else to add? I have a little bit. I have one more thing I want to say. Elan Lee: Oh, okay. I want to hear one more thing. Tim Ferriss: I just wanted to thank you so much for allowing me to be part of this incredible ride — Elan Lee: Oh, my goodness. Tim Ferriss: — and just collaborating on the game. It’s been so meaningful for me and so much fun and so great to get closer with you and your family, and we’ve all been traveling together since. Elan Lee: I love it. Tim Ferriss: And to work with the incredible team that you have at Exploding Kittens. I’m not going to mention them all because there are quite few — Elan Lee: So many. Tim Ferriss: — but it’s just been such a joy and a dream come true to actually have this thing in my mind that was floating around that I’ve always wanted to do. And now here it is and people can get it. Elan Lee: Tim Ferriss made a game. Look, here’s the thing — Tim Ferriss: I’m thinking — Elan Lee: — you’re so welcome and thank you. We have limited time here and you have to choose your endeavors wisely, and this was one of the wisest choices I’ve ever made. Tim Ferriss: Oh, thanks, man. All right. We’re going to go get a fantastic meal. It’s Texas, so probably a bunch of meat, barbecue. Who knows, maybe some tequila and make an appearance unbidden. You never know. Strange things happen out here in Austin, Texas. And for everybody listening, we will link to all sorts of things, many resources that will help you think about how you might create a game. You could start with the blank cards in Coyote. Those will actually teach you a lot, I think, as you begin to experiment with these different elements. Elan Lee: Because you’re going to fail, because your first few are not going to work and you’ll learn why. Tim Ferriss: And then if you run out of blank cards, look, just go get some blank cards. Just go buy a blank deck and you can use those. But this is something anyone can do. You did this with your daughter when she was how old? Elan Lee: Four. Tim Ferriss: Four. This is an incredibly fun family activity. It’s an incredibly fun friend activity and it gets you off of your screens. It’s not good for you folks. Elan Lee: So important. Tim Ferriss: They are tools, but there is a point at which the tools become our masters and that is where a lot of the poison seeps in around the cracks. Elan Lee: This thing builds memories. That’s what you should be doing. That’s what your phone isn’t doing. This is building memories. Tim Ferriss: Building memories with some durability, not ephemera that get pushed out of your head as soon as you watch the next 10-second clip. This is something I’ve wanted to do for so long and I’m thrilled that it’s here. Fingers crossed. I’m still nervous as hell, obviously. But we’ve done so much play testing. Hundreds of people have play tested at this point and have made these fine-tuning tweaks along the way. I would love everybody to think about your life as a collection of games. You may not be aware of which games you’re playing just yet, but rest assured in some respects you are playing games and you get to choose more games than you realize. Most of them are optional, not all of them. Sure, we have responsibilities as adults and so on, but this is a way to open up that Pandora’s box of possibility. And we’ll include a lot of resources in the show notes, so tim.blog/podcast, just search Coyote. That’ll probably be the easiest way to find it. C-O-Y-O-T-E. And another time I’ll explain the backstory there, which is pretty wild, but for another time. And until next time, as always, be a little kinder than is necessary, not just to others, also to yourself. Play wisely. Find fun problems. And I’m going to check out that podcast. And life is short, have fun while you’re here, folks. And until next time, thanks for tuning in. Δ Δ Comment Rules: Remember what Fonzie was like? Cool. That's how we're gonna be — cool.

This is a very special episode for me, one I’ve been looking forward to publishing for months. It features a behind-the-scenes look at my latest creative project, my new game COYOTE. COYOTE is a fast, casual card game I created with Elan and the Exploding Kittens team. It has been my obsession for two years. I worked really hard on every aspect of this one (concept, mechanics, art, you name it)! You can finally buy it everywhere, including Amazon, Target, Walmart, and 8,000+ retail locations worldwide. It’s been a hit with 100+ test families, my friends, and at conferences around the world. It now produces guaranteed laughs with kids, adults, tipsy people, serious people… all who enjoy unleashing their inner trickster. If you’ve benefited from my podcast, newsletter, books, or anything at all, please grab a copy or two! It only costs $10-12 and can provide hours upon hours of fun. It takes minutes to learn and 10 minutes to play. Under the hood, it’s also designed to be a good workout for your brain. If you’ve ever wanted to learn how to get a product on the shelves of something like Walmart or Target, or simply create a game, this podcast covers it all. P.S. One last thing: read to the end for a very fun surprise that involves a mystery Hollywood party.

This is another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show. I’m Tim Ferriss and I’m sitting with a friend of mine who I brought to my podcast with a secret agenda that has ended up two years later with a very, very not-so-secret-for-long outcome that we’re going to talk about, Elan Lee. Elan Lee: Thanks. Tim Ferriss: Nice to see you again. Elan Lee: It’s nice to see you too. That was a secret agenda. That was a two-year-in-the-making secret agenda. Tim Ferriss: Two years in the making. So what we’re going to do in this conversation, and I just hijacked his bio because I’ve had too much caffeine, so I’m going to let him do the self-intro in a second. But we’re going to give you a peek behind the curtain, under the hood, open the kimono, choose your metaphor. We’re going to talk about the creative process, the development process, thinking about distribution, retail, all of these things which I have not heard discussed anywhere else in depth. Elan Lee: You buried the lead. All of that stuff of — Tim Ferriss: Of a game that we created that from the very beginning was something I’ve wanted to do my whole life, which is create a game. I was raised, protected in some ways by Dungeons & Dragons as a kid. It was my refuge from bullying and also just the straight boredom of most of my schooling at the time. And that immersive experience, the ability to get lost in a world of imagination and fun and laughter and emotion was so incredibly important. It was so formative for me that the seed was planted really early. And I think you know this because I probably sent you a photograph of this at one point. I still have all of my modules. I have The Player’s Handbook, First Edition, Dungeon Master’s Guide, all of the dice, everything from when I was a kid. I’ve kept it to this day. Elan Lee: I love this, I love this. But hold on. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: If you’re not going to say it, I’m going to say it. Tim Ferriss made a game. Tim Ferriss: I did. Elan Lee: That’s amazing. Tim Ferriss: It took me 47 years, but here we are. So the game, I’ll just show it to camera for people who want a visual who are not watching this. If you’re listening, you can go to tim.blog/coyote. So I’m giving a bit of what you might call foreshadowing in the biz. But this is the game. It is a card game. It’s called Coyote. That name did not come easily. We went through about 537 different names and lots of testing and we’ll talk about some of that. But this is the game and it’s effectively, I’d like to hear your pitch because we have slightly different approaches, but I would say it is rock-paper-scissors on steroids. So there are God knows how many, maybe 20 different gestures, something like that, 66 total cards. And you can play cooperatively where you’re all trying to beat the game together or competitively where you can sabotage individual players, throw curveballs of all different types, and that relates to the name Coyote, if you think about the trickster mythology associated with Coyote. Elan Lee: Yeah Tim Ferriss: We never got to your bio. Who the hell are you? Elan Lee: Oh, that’s the least interesting part of this whole thing. Tim Ferriss: No, I know, but it puts it in perspective and just explain the company a bit, the scope of it, et cetera Elan Lee: I love talking about games, I hate talking about myself. So I will try. Tim Ferriss: That’s why it takes someone like me to force you to do it. Elan Lee: Yeah. Okay, here we go. My name is Elan Lee. I am the co-creator and CEO of Exploding Kittens. I believe we’re the number one independent game studio in the world, something like that. I don’t know. We’ve sold a whole bunch of games. We’ve sold 60 million games at this point and been running that company for 10 years now. And before that I was the chief design officer at the Xbox and before that I worked at a pet store. Tim Ferriss: And for people who want the full journey, including the sort of magical tinderbox that was Kickstarter way back in the day, how this whole adventure started 10 plus years ago, listen to the first conversation that I did with Elan. I had wanted to make a game and quickly realized that an RPG, something like Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game, was going to be too complicated for me and my friends as adults to play. It would be too hard for me to recruit my friends where you have, let’s just say, a full day, then you have dinner, maybe you have a few drinks, and then you have an hour before people split. There’s no way I’m going to get someone to build, for instance, a chaotic good gray elf, which was my orientation, and work from there. It’s just not going to happen. And meanwhile, about maybe it was a year or two years before I invited you on the podcast, I found this game Poetry for Neanderthals and holy shit, had so much fun with that with my friends. I thought, “Okay, I think I want to tilt my game dreams,” which at that point had no real direction, “towards something more casual.” But in the meantime, I’d also been listening to all sorts of podcasts and so on that we’ll get to. But you’ve explained your background. Elan Lee: Well, hold on. So what you just described is exactly why I started Exploding Kittens, because I also — okay, a little bit different. Unlike you, I, when I encounter those crazy two and four and six-hour games, I am immediately turned off. I can’t focus for that long. I can’t understand the rules. If it takes longer than five minutes to explain a game, I am gone. I have no ability to play that game. And so the whole reason I started this company, and I think the whole reason that you made the pivot from giant role-playing games to being interested in the creation of casual fast-party games is this golden rule of two minutes to learn, 15 minutes to play because nothing’s at stake there, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: You’re going to learn it. You’re either going to love the game or you’re going to hate it, but whatever, you committed five minutes total to that thing. And I love the games where after the five-minute commitment, you’re still going to play for two hours. But they’re going to be in these little five-minute sessions over and over and over again. And it sounds like that’s the experience you had, which makes me so happy because that means mission accomplished. That’s exactly what I wanted to build. Tim Ferriss: And we’re going to talk about different rules or tenets that you have because what I want to do in this conversation, we’re definitely going to talk about the process of building this game because I am really, really happy with it and really proud. Elan Lee: It’s so good. You should be. It’s so good. Tim Ferriss: And we’ll have a lot to talk about. But the motivation also of basically showing the cards, I’m going to use so many mixed metaphors here, is to teach people game design and explain why this has possessed such a toehold in my mind for so long. Elan Lee: Yeah. Well, you went through a journey and I’m excited looking at that journey through your eyes of, “I don’t even know what I want to build, but I know I want to build a fun experience that I would enjoy, that my friends would enjoy,” all the way through to this thing is at every Walmart and Target in North America. That journey is incredible and you got to see it for the first time. You absolutely drank from the firehose here. This was fun for me because I had to walk you through this, right? You’ve never sold a game before. So walking through the process of how you make a game and how you sell a game, it doesn’t work the way people think. So retailers have a buyer per category. So if anybody wants to sell something to a retailer, you want something in Target or Walmart or Amazon or Barnes & Noble. The way it works is you have to convince the buyer for your category to take your thing, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: They have limited shelf space. It’s very precious real estate. So you have to convince them that your thing is better than anybody else’s thing. And twice a year they have these things called line reviews.The buyers have to buy games for next year, right? They need to put stuff on the shelf. There’s only a certain number of meetings they can physically have in a period of time because it’s usually one or two or maybe three people. So they take as many meetings as they can. It’s usually a dozen, maybe two dozen. And in those meetings — Tim Ferriss: In your case, with different game manufacturers, different studios. Elan Lee: Exactly. So they’ll take a meeting with Hasbro and they’ll take a meeting with Mattel and all the big guys. And in those meetings, 20, 30, 50 games are pitched to them in every single one of those meetings. And then they’ll make a decision on which ones they’re going to purchase and stock for the next year. So that’s line review. The tricky parts for line review is one, you got to do a great job, but even before that, you got to get that meeting, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: They only have time for a certain number of meetings. So you have to put yourself in a position where you can get in that room. Tim Ferriss: All right, so we’re going to talk strategy and tactics for line review in a minute because, and take this as a compliment, you are one of the best in-person salespeople I’ve ever seen. Elan Lee: That could also be an insult, but I’ll take it, I’ll take it. Tim Ferriss: No, it’s not an insult. No, no, it’s not an insult. Everybody’s in sales, whether they like to admit it or not, whether you’re selling ideas, you’re selling a position, a perspective, if you want to call it deal making. This is what I used to say in my class, my guest lecture that I taught for 10 years, once or twice a year in high-tech entrepreneurship. I would start off by saying, “Who here wants to be in sales?” No hands would go up and I would say, “Well, I’ve got some good news and I’ve got some bad news. Bad news is you’re all in sales. And let me explain why. If you want to call it deal making, fine, you’re going to have to negotiate. You don’t get what you deserve. You get what you negotiate.” Elan Lee: That’s well said. Tim Ferriss: “And you get what you can present in a very persuasive way.” I was like, “The good news is you can learn it.” Elan Lee: Awesome. Tim Ferriss: This is a coachable, learnable skill, which I completely still believe. There’s some people who may have a little bit of extraversion, charismatic reality, distortion, field advantage, but you can become excellent even if you start with zero raw materials. Okay, so the journey, wanted to make a game my whole life, but it was this vague, “Maybe someday. God, wouldn’t it be nice?” Elan Lee: Let me just poke at that for a second. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, sure. Elan Lee: Why? Tim Ferriss: The why is I wanted to imbue someone else’s experience with the magic I felt playing D&D. Elan Lee: Well said. Tim Ferriss: That’s it. Or much easier games, right? It’s such a simple game. I used to play Sorry and Monopoly. And as a young kid, I just thought Sorry was the most hilarious thing when you could look someone in the eyes and go, “Sorry,” and knock their stuff off the board. I didn’t always respond well when it happened to me. It doesn’t have to be the incredibly immersive, complex game that D&D is, although I still think that is just like Gary Gygax and the team way back in the day, holy cow. Also, by the way, for people who don’t know, Gen Con, huge convention, started out around Lake Geneva and was, I believe, created by the TSR guys way back in the day. Elan Lee: I believe that’s right. Yeah. Yeah, Gen Con from Lake Geneva and then was the Generals Convention, and now is nothing. Now Gen Con doesn’t stand for anything because it’s in Indianapolis. But anyway, sorry. It was an aside. Tim Ferriss: It’s an aside. So that was the kind of impetus behind wanting to make a game, but it didn’t have any form. And then I suppose it was maybe two and a half, three years ago, I was like, “Okay, I’d like to actually take a deeper dive here.” Because there are lots of things we have on our, say, list of New Year’s resolutions. For instance, for a long time I had “Develop the side splits like Jean-Claude Van Damme.” Never happened, but it was there every fucking year and it just got punted. I was like, “Well, didn’t do it. Okay, this year is the year.” But there was no plan, there were no deadlines, there were no constraints, which is the power of constraints, which we’ll probably talk about. Elan Lee: Absolutely, yes. Tim Ferriss: It is so critical. It’s not just critical. It is additive to have constraints, which seems like a contradiction, but it’s not. Well, we’ll, I’m sure, get to that. So I started looking at different options and the catalyst for this actually was something way back in the day, some of you will remember called The Legend of CØCKPUNCH, and that was an NFT project — remember those? Which raised two million bucks for fundamental science and mechanistic studies basically related to mental health. So all the proceeds from that, if you want to look it up, it’s easy to find Legend of CØCKPUNCH. But all the proceeds went to a nonprofit foundation, which then funds mental health, therapeutic research and things related to that. But in the process of doing that, I got to, with very low stakes because I think it’s helpful when possible, especially if you’re an intrepid beginner wading into unfamiliar creative waters, make the stakes super, super low, right? And even before this podcast, it’s like, “Okay, this is a very unusual conversation where it’s like, “Look, we’re not doing this live. If we really don’t like it, we can scrap the whole thing.” So reduce, reduce, reduce the pressure and the stakes until you can get started, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: With writing, I got the advice long ago, two crappy pages per day. That’s it. Elan Lee: Love it. Tim Ferriss: And then you actually put pen to paper. Elan Lee: Yeah, the overlaps are enormous with games. But, yeah, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. Super related. Also the iterative process. All right, so using The Legend of CØCKPUNCH as this pretext, basically I started writing fiction and so I wrote these very, very, it turned out to be very involved, very viable fantasy histories and pieces, tying all of these greater houses together and then having these protagonists, the father and then the son, who’s Tyrolean, and yada, yada, yada, yada. And I still think there might be something there, but in the process of creating that, I thought to myself, “This would actually make a fantastic game. And it wouldn’t have to be as complicated as D&D, but you would have allies, you would have age old amenities, would have different strengths, certain strengths that cancel out other strengths, weaknesses that can be taken advantage of.” And that led me to start listening to a podcast called Think Like a Game Designer with Justin Gary, which is outstanding. I recommend people check it out. And a lot of the focus there, not entirely, but a lot of the focus there was on trading card games, alternately called collectible card games, I guess. Wizards of the Coast who created Magic: The Gathering, patented and trademarked one of them. So they seem to be used interchangeably. But Justin, also former high-level competitive Magic: The Gathering player, has a lot of knowledge around that world. He’s developed some incredibly successful games in that genre where you’re building a deck, you’re buying certain cards or decks with the hopes of getting certain cards and assembling your toolkit basically. And that was initially where my mind went in terms of game concept. But I realized a few things really quickly. I was a D&D guy, which predated Magic: The Gathering. My brother was a Magic: The Gathering guy. But I’ve never really played Magic. And when I began to delve into it, I was like, “You know what? I would like to think of this as D&D light, but this is incredibly nuanced.” Right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: To be good at this — Elan Lee: Oh, for sure, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — it is incredibly nuanced. And also if you’re against someone who is really experienced or just has their mind wired for it, you are going to be obliterated. Elan Lee: Absolutely right. Tim Ferriss: And that’s what happened to me playing a friend of mine, kudos to Mike, just got slayed. And God bless Mike, he’s like a number of my friends who just kind of want to watch you die slowly in this agonizing ill-fated gameplay where you’re kind of whimpering along until they put you out of your misery. Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah, you play a card, he said, “Isn’t this cute? You think you’ve got it. Watch this.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which is just not really my thing. So I thought to myself, okay, looking at some of the casual games I really like, there is an opportunity, and this will come back later, for the underdog or the person who is behind to win. So there’s an element, it is skill-based, but there’s an element of chance and this is going to come back. So then Poetry for Neanderthals, I don’t know how I found it initially, frankly. I think I probably went into a game shop and I was like, “Hey,” and this relates to why, as an adult, I want to spend less time in front of screens and ultimately if I look back and do this thing every year called a past year review, people can find it online, you can read all about it and do it yourself. You don’t have to buy anything, past year review. Where I look at the peak positive and negative emotional experiences of the past year, I go through my whole calendar. Sometimes I’ll go through my photos, sometimes I’ll go through my text messages or my sent folder in the inbox. And lo and behold, and this is not a revelation for some people, but the activities did not matter as much as the people. So then the question is, how do I create different contexts for interacting with, let’s just say, my 10 or 15 closest friends? Some of that is doing things outside in the wilderness that are active and so on. But that’s a heavy lift, that’s a heavier lift than — Elan Lee: A high barrier of entry. Tim Ferriss: — playing a casual game, right? So it’s like if I’m here in Austin, where we are right now, and my friends or a bunch of my friends come in for South by Southwest and I manage to get them together for one night, what can we play that will get us off of our goddamn phones and deepen our relationship and create memories that we can hold onto that will stick around? That’s it. That’s it, right? Elan Lee: So good. Tim Ferriss: And then we had our conversation and that’s kind of when everything, I guess, kicked off. Just a couple of things maybe that we should mention also. After our conversation when, I think, very shyly I must have reached out to you at some point shortly thereafter, and I was kind of like, “Hey, guy, not sure if this would be interesting, but maybe kind of sort, do you want to talk about maybe making a game together or something?” Elan Lee: I remember this exact conversation. It’s like asking me out on a first date. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, yeah, like scratching my head looking at the ground. And that’s how the whole thing got kicked off. And I want to mention something related to that, which was for the last probably three years, my New Year’s resolutions have been very — they’re very broad, but they’re pretty specific. So I had two. One is doing more delegation, which is figure it out delegation. So what that means is rather than doing what I’m hardwired to do with my OCD and perfectionism, which is, “Here, go do this thing. Let me give you a 20-page installation manual explaining exactly what to do,” versus, “Here’s roughly what I want done. Just figure it out and get it done. I don’t want to make any decisions, So don’t come back to me with 12 options. Just make the best you can.” And I’ll expect Reid Hoffman also, LinkedIn has mentioned this sort of a 10 percent footfall rate, like 10 percent of the time something’s going to go sideways and that’s fine in the interest of reducing decision fatigue and making things faster. So one was more figure it out delegation and number two was sprints with creatives. And for me what that meant as someone who has operated as a lone wolf, which by the way is a contradiction in terms, but who has been a solo operator for most of my creative projects, I was like, “You know what? It just isn’t that fun anymore to do it solo.” And it’s also antithetical to some of the creative projects I want to pursue like a game. I mean, there are some amazing solo game designers. Not to say there aren’t, but I was like, “You know what? I want to try to be more social in my creativity and collaborate with creatives and do sprints.” Now, sometimes those sprints turn into longer things, but those have been sort of my two guiding lights for the last few years, which is what then gave me the ability to build up the courage. It sounds so ridiculous to say, but to actually reach out to you and be like, “Hey, do you want to actually just bat around the possibility of something?” Elan Lee: So from my perspective, that conversation, I got very excited to work with you on something, one, because it turns out you’re just a lovely human being and so much fun to hang out with. Tim Ferriss: Thank you. Elan Lee: But two, I asked you that very fundamental question. You said, “Hey, do you want to build a game?” And I said, “Why do you want to build a game?” And your answer was almost identical to what you just related. You talked about your past experiences, you talked about childhood memories of games, you talked about what you like and what you don’t like. And what became very clear to me was there’s something special going on here. Tim wants to treat his friends and his audience to something extraordinary. And we get approached all the time by people who want to make games, big celebrities and singers and actors, all of them want to make a game. And whenever I ask them the question “Why?” the answer is invariably, “Because my agent told me to,” or, “Because I think I can make money,” or really very superficial. Often they’re not game players at all. They have no connection to the experience of game design. And when I spoke to you, none of that was present. Instead it was, “This is a very personal thing to me, and ultimately I want to give a gift.” And that’s when my brain started lighting up. It’s like, “Oh, this is going to be fun. He’s in this for all the reasons I’m in this and that means we can make something very special together.” And I think we have. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, we definitely have. And another question that is sometimes a little tricky to apply, but that has been in my mind for a while, since Seth Godin, very well-known author, thinker, just incredibly sage and awesome human being. He reframed for me, which is the reframing of the question, “What would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail?” Right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: That’s a good question. Like what would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail? All right, that’s freeing. But the way he tweaks that is he said, “What would you do if you knew you would fail?” In other words, like, what would you do for which the process alone would make it worth it? And for me, because I mean, we became fast friends very quickly, and I was like, “Okay, that’s rare for me as an adult, number one.” And I’ve been banging this around in my own little head for so long. Even if this ends up not making the cut for whatever reason, this seems worth it to me, right? Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Because coming back to the people over activities also, I was like, “Love hanging out with Elan and connecting. I am going to learn a lot.” And at the very worst, I learn a lot and we’ve deepened our relationship. And that stuff just snowballs over time. It transcends a single project. So even if this had not manifested, it would’ve been worth it and that’s how I try to pick my projects these days. Elan Lee: So when we first started down this path together, I remember I came out, we sort of visited each other back and forth a few times. And I remember every time I would pack a suitcase full of games and we would sit with some of your friends and we’d play games all night long and you’d say, “I like this one. I don’t like this one. I like this part.” But ultimately, we weren’t making any progress. We were just learning vocabulary, essentially. And I would go home and my wife would be like, “How’d it go? What did you learn? Are you going to make a game together?” And I’d be like, “I don’t know. No, we just hung out and had fun.” And she’d be like, “Wasn’t that a huge disappointment? You traveled 2,000 miles to go see him?” I’m like, “No, it was just fun. Nah, I’m not disappointed at all. We’ll just do it again next month and we’ll see how it goes.” And we did that five or six times. And I remember walking away from each one just thinking, same thing, “If this goes nowhere, I’m having so much fun.” That’s so rare. Tim Ferriss: It is rare. And if you can orient your life or professional life, and look, I’m not saying this is possible for everyone, but it’s to some extent more possible than people realize. You might not be able to run out and invite Elan on your podcast and then awkwardly approach him like a sheepish 12-year-old boy to ask him on a date. But taking the lens of picking projects based on creating or deepening relationships and learning/developing skills, if you just do that over time, it is almost inevitable that you will win, whatever winning means to you. Elan Lee: Yeah, value the process, yeah. Tim Ferriss: So let’s talk a little bit about the origin story. Now, I’ll throw out a couple of things here and we’re going to talk about the game development, and then we’re also going to talk about how to sell this thing. How does that work? Elan Lee: And it’s worth saying, designing a game, I remember you asked me this early on. You started out from the, “Hey, let’s design a game,” and then we’re basically done. And I remember really forcing myself to think through this process because I wanted to explain it to you. “No, that’s half of it. The other half is selling the game. And just as much work goes into that. And if you’re not willing to do it or if you have no mechanism by which you can do it, might as well not design the game because one without the other, useless.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. So it depends on the scale you’re going after, right? If you want to make something for your friends, you can do that. Elan Lee: Sure, Yeah, okay. Fair enough. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But in this particular case, I mean — Elan Lee: You wanted to make something cool and share it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I wanted to share. I wanted to share it. So that kind of dictated parts of the process that we needed to weigh really heavily. So the game development process, I mean, we started off looking at the possibilities of modifying existing games, right? So looking at, say, Poetry for Neanderthals — Elan Lee: Poetry, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — with an alternate set of rules or a different deck plus A, B, or C. We looked at prototype games that you alluded to earlier, bringing the suitcase, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So we did that all over the country. Elan Lee: Yeah, I showed up, I remember. So I have this notebook of game ideas three, 400 in there, and I add more every month. And I remember I picked my favorites, like five or six of them, and I would show up with just the jankiest prototypes. Like, “Here’s something I scribbled on a few cards.” I took some dice and I rubbed out the little nubs on the dice and hand wrote something on all the die faces. “Instead, let’s try playing this weird game.” And you were very patient and you had a lot of vision, thankfully, to look at these just horrible, very hastily created prototypes and say, not, “This is no fun, let’s move on.” But you would always say, “Oh, I like this. I like the — that moment where we had a conversation about what you were going to do next. I like that part. I didn’t like the rest of it, but I like that part.” And that astute sense of notes, really thoughtful and forward moving notes was ultimately what guided our conversation. Because then the next time, I don’t have to pick from 400 games to bring. Now I know, “Okay, this cooperative thing, he liked that conversation aspect. There’s only six games I’ve got like that. Let me bring those six and we’ll refine it even farther.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, totally. So we can talk about the Toronto trip. The Toronto project. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: That is where things started to gel. Because we’d had a number of these meetings around the country where we would do a one to three day sprint of testing, take all these notes and we’d done a few of these and we’ve both got a lot going on and your wife would ask you how it went and you’re like, “Well, I’m not really sure. I think we had fun, but no game as of yet.” And so we scheduled time. I was going to fly to Toronto to do a sprint. You were going to bring in an expert game designer, sort of game mechanic specialist — Elan Lee: Ken Gruhl, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — Ken. And it was like, “Okay, this is the trip. If we make it happen, great. If not, we’re just going to call spade a spade.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: We were circling around this thing but not really getting it done. Elan Lee: It was like meeting number eight or nine at that point. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah, we tried a lot. And it was during that trip that the very primitive sort of germ of an idea started to resonate, which ended up being Coyote. And I remember a few things, and thank God also for Ken’s apparent photographic memory with the way things transpired, but we’re walking around all over the place in Toronto, the three of us, just spitballing. Then it starts to rain and we seek shelter. We failed twice, I think, with various coffee shops. Elan Lee: Yeah, can’t get in. Tim Ferriss: No room, no seats, whatever it might be. End up sitting in this weird kind of multipurpose building. And I remember where we were sitting and we played, I guess in English it’s Hanabi. Elan Lee: Hanabi. Tim Ferriss: Hanabi, which is Hanabi in Japanese, which is fireworks. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And hana’s flower. Bi in this case is fire. So it’s like flower fire. That’s Hanabi. Elan Lee: For everybody out there, if you haven’t played Hanabi, go try this game. It is very special. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So we played that game, kind of killing time, giving it a shot, because you guys had mentioned it. And I was like, “Okay, this is a very elegant game.” And from that, liked the cooperative aspect. So when people think game, I think most folks are more familiar, maybe exclusively familiar, with the sort of winner-takes-all or team-versus-team competitive type of game. But I really enjoyed, and I’d seen this in other ways in different capacities, but the cooperative option and the cooperative aspect of this. So that then gets stuck in the mind and the rain clears up. We go for a walk by the water. And I remember we were sort of — well, I’ll own it, I was kind of stalled. I’ll be the kind of hair plugging the drain in the bathtub. Because I was trying to search my mind for game examples. But I was thinking tabletop games because that was the canvas we were painting upon. And we’re walking, we’re walking. We’ve had quite a bit of caffeine by this point and it was either you or Ken, I think it was you, who asked, “Well, just broadly speaking, any kind of game, what games have you really enjoyed?” And that’s where Rock, Paper, Scissors came up, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Rochambeau. And I just — as dumb as it might sound, and I said this at the time, I was like, “I love Rock, Paper, Scissors.” Especially when you play over an extended period of time with friends, maybe there’s some alcohol involved or not, you don’t need to have it involved. But you start to pick up tells, you start to pick up patterns, and it’s actually very, very fun. Elan Lee: So it’s important to note, the moment you bring up Rock, Paper, Scissors in any game design discussion, that’s usually the end of the conversation, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Because there’s nothing to that game. There’s three tools, deploy a tool, determine a winner, you’re done. It is only when you say, “Let’s acknowledge Rock, Paper, Scissors is no fun unless you play multiple times.” Because now we’ve made a very important transition. We’re not playing the game anymore, we’re playing each other. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Right? Because I know what you did last time. You think I’m going to throw scissors again. And now we’re playing each other. Yes, rock, paper, scissors are the tools by which we’re playing each other, but suddenly we’re playing a very different game and it starts — it cannot start in round one. It starts in round two and it moves forward from there. And once we started having that discussion, things started to get really interesting. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, things got interesting. And do you want to show the prototype deck? Elan Lee: Yeah, I’ll show. Tim Ferriss: And part of the reason I want to show this prototype deck, and we’ll describe it for people who aren’t watching, is quick and dirty is the fucking way to go. And I will just make another recommendation for Stephen Key. So Stephen Key has a book called the One Simple Idea, which is about licensing and creating inventions. He’s got a number of books now. But Stephen has made a gajillion dollars creating games for all the biggies that you can possibly think of. And he uses construction paper and glue you would find in a second grade class and a handful of markers. Elan Lee: Love it. This is already my — Tim Ferriss: And this is by and large, that is how he creates these amazing — now, when I say — they can be games, they can be toys. He’s pretty broad spectrum. But it might be a new way to play basketball, shooting dirty laundry into a hamper, right? Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: Something like that. And he prototypes these things incredibly quickly. And for him, for what he does, that is enough. He is able to put together a pitch, he’s able to sell it and he’s able to develop these amazing passive income streams with these annuities that just come in — Elan Lee: So good. Tim Ferriss: — from all these different places. But that relates to what we’re looking at. Elan Lee: Okay. I love that we have not even described what Coyote is yet. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. Elan Lee: But that’s okay because it’s more fun I think, to walk — I think the value of this conversation is to actually talk through the creative process and talk through — I think a lot of people want to make games, this is how you do it. And we went through this two-year journey and we arrived at a very happy outcome. So I’m excited to talk about, “Well, let me show you the very ugly, very first deck we ever built.” So we had this conversation about Rock, Paper, Scissors, and I knew there was something there because we were talking about players playing — my fundamental premise behind all game design is games should not be entertaining. Games should make the players entertaining. And suddenly, when you said, “Rock, Paper, Scissors over time,” I was like, “Oh, that’s perfect.” But three tools, rock, paper and scissors, not a very robust tool set. We can’t really play a game that way. So I ran home and started scribbling on cards. These are just blank cards. I took Sharpies, I buy these by the thousands on Amazon. So I had a ton of these and we just started scribbling. And so we made a card that says rock, and we made a card that says paper, and we made a card that says scissors. And we thought, “What if we’re all on the same team? But what if these cards here are not tools to fight with each other? What if these are a challenge that we have to all solve together?” And so we started just putting down a bunch of things, rock, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper. And we’re like, “All right, we’ll sit around the table and we’ll all just do this pattern. Everyone do scissors. Now everyone do paper. Now everyone do rock.” Tim Ferriss: And we’d been talking about these different variations and ideas on the walk and then we ended up back at your dining room table — Elan Lee: Yeah, that’s right. Tim Ferriss: — with tons — Elan Lee: Seriously scribbling. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, scribbling and modifying cards as we went. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly. So now the modifiers are really the most interesting thing. Because the game that I’m describing right now is useless. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: We can all do scissors and then all do paper. Who cares, right? There’s nothing here. But now we have a baseline. We’re all going to do this thing. Cool, easy. And then we started doing these modifiers, all players do all blue cards. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: So we start scribbling rock, paper, scissors in different colors, and then we’ve got this modifier. So now everyone’s going to — sorry, I’m going to do scissors, but then we’re all going to do paper and then back to you just doing rock, and things like that. And so then it was like, “Okay, well, skip a player after every red card. Okay, shout every blue card,” right? Then we just started writing all these crazy modifiers. I’m just putting all these cards all over the table because the challenge got more and more interesting. And then it was like, “Okay, so something interesting is possible here. Now what if instead of just splashing cards all over the paper, what if we were responsible for this? What if one at a time everyone had to add a new card to the table to make this challenge harder and harder and harder?” And that’s when we started talking about the vocabulary of this game. What are these cards? What makes this thing harder? Rock and paper and scissors very quickly got eliminated from the game because they’re so boring. So we started talking about, “Well, okay, what if you’re making a peace sign?” And then you came up with, “Well, what if you pose a ballerina on a card? And what if you slap the shoulder or the person next to you on a card? And what if you have to — ” I remember one of our earliest notes was, “Eliminate all shouting cards,” because that was no fun at all. Tim Ferriss: We tested that. And then that got all old real quick. Elan Lee: Right, exactly. Tim Ferriss: And also as we’re play testing, right? As we’re inventing mechanics and testing different things. So we play for a few rounds being like, “Okay, that was okay, but what do you guys think of this?” “Okay, we like this aspect.” “Great, let’s make four more of those cards of different colors.” And then we played again. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And then we played again. And then we’d iterate and we played again. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: And we ended up with, I mean, spreadsheets full of different cards. And this is all still now in cooperative mode at that point. Elan Lee: All in cooperative mode. Tim Ferriss: And — Elan Lee: But over the next week, I would say we designed 80 percent of the game. We were at this stalled-at-one-percent mode for months. And then in a matter of days, 80 percent done. Because we found this every time we played some version of this, the immediate answer when we were done playing was, “Let’s go again.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So is that the litmus test for you? Elan Lee: For sure. Tim Ferriss: I mean in terms of the indicators that something is worth further development, right? Elan Lee: Yeah,. Tim Ferriss: Because you have 400 in your notebook and so you’re not going to develop all of those. What are some of the — could be a water feel that you have, but what are some of the indicators where you’re like, “Oh, okay.” Elan Lee: So there’s two things to talk about here. Certainly “Let’s play again” is a great one, but to set your mind in a place where you’re willing to say, “Imagine this, but tweaked, but something a little different.” There’s this principle I love called the zero effect. Zero effect. Tim Ferriss: Zero effect? Elan Lee: Yeah, zero effect. It’s from a movie, I think, in the late ’80s, early ’90s, somewhere around there called Zero Effect. And there’s this one scene where they explain what the zero effect is. And it is as follows, if you’ve lost your car keys and you’re looking for your car keys, here you are in your living room, you’re looking for car keys, the chances of you finding your car keys are very low because there’s so many things in this room that are not your car keys. So your chances of finding that one thing very, very low. If instead you are trying to find anything, your chances of success are suddenly at a hundred percent. You will find something, as long as you don’t care what it is that you found. That’s my favorite premise for brainstorming and for early testing. Don’t lock in your head, “I’m looking for this particular thing. I must find X. I must find X.” Because the chances that you’re going to find that thing are almost non-existent. But if you can keep your brain open and say, “I’m just looking for something. I don’t care what it is, something, anything, and I’ll tweak it later, I’ll play with it later. I’ll find some way to consider this thing I found my car keys.” As long as you’re willing to make that leap, brainstorming becomes a pleasure. Tim Ferriss: And does that take the form of, “What if, blah?” “What if we blah?” “What if this card did blah?” Elan Lee: Precisely. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Is it a series of what ifs? Elan Lee: And you’re not scared for all of those to fail, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Because you can come up with those all day long. And that’s what we did, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: Over the next few days, that process, “What if, blah. Let’s try it. What if, blah, let’s try it. What if, whatever, let’s try it.” And as long as the answer is always, “Let’s try it,” you will a hundred percent find what you’re looking for. Tim Ferriss: All right, so let’s make some recommendations for people listening or watching. What books or resources would you recommend for people who are interested in game development? Now, I want to reiterate also, whether you think you’re playing games or not, you’re already playing games in life. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So for me, this is a way of putting on a table what we’ve already implicitly agreed to in our own lives in ways that we generally don’t realize, which is we’re all playing games. Now what does that mean? That means that beyond Maslow’s basic rungs on the ladder, shelter, warmth, food, et cetera, at some point, particularly as adults, maybe it’s before you go to school, maybe it’s when you’re in college, but you have decided to play or you have just ended up drafting into a game with certain rules, certain conditions for winning or losing certain ranking mechanisms. And step number one is figuring out what games you’re playing. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So I would suggest that learning about building games helps you to put on x-ray vision glasses, where you start to see the world is comprised of tons of games. Elan Lee: Yeah, it’s so true. And you start to dive deeper into game theory. What is the prisoner’s dilemma? What is a zero sum game? If you can start to identify those very fundamental game design concepts in the real world, you can jump to the end of a conversation so much faster. You can avoid so many missteps because everything follows, within reason, everything follows game design principles because this practice, this art form has been so well studied and so well researched and so well documented that you get to take advantage of all of that. And I love that. I use that for my relationships. I use that as playing with my kids. I use that at work all the time. It’s just there’s these fundamental principles of game design. And I’ll talk about a book I’d love that illustrates them. But, yeah, they can be applied to anything. You’re right, you’re playing a game all the time. And the first step is to be aware that you are playing a game. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: All right, so I’ve got two books. Tim Ferriss: Let’s hear it. Elan Lee: One is, let’s see, A Theory of Fun by Raph Koster. Raph Koster? Raph Koster? R-A-P-H, Raph. It’ll outline all these fundamentals. It is the first game design book I ever read. It is the one I go back to and refer to the most often. It’s just got everything and the author is brilliant and go read that book. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: The second one is going to be a little controversial. Tim Ferriss: Memoirs of a Geisha? Elan Lee: It’s called Don’t Shoot the Dog. Tim Ferriss: Oh, this is an exceptional book. Elan Lee: Exceptional book. It is by Karen Pryor. Tim Ferriss: It is not explicitly about game design, at all. Elan Lee: It is not at all about game design. But here’s the thing, this book, the fundamental premise of this book is you are trying to teach a companion, a dog, to behave in a certain way. And the answer to how best to do that is not to, when things go wrong at least, not to blame the dog, is to fundamentally change the way you operate and the way you convey information and the way you look at the world in order to better relate to your dog and to the way that the dog understands and sees the world. It is the best game design principle I have ever encountered in my life. And true, it has nothing to do with game design, but when you’re designing a game, you’re designing it for a target, for someone who isn’t you and you’re not even going to be in the room when they encounter it. And to have in your brain from the very first step, “Every problem that comes up is my problem, not theirs. Every responsibility is my responsibility, not theirs.” And if you can get that in your head and design games that way, those are the games I have found that are the most successful. Tim Ferriss: This is Don’t Shoot the Dog, terrible title, but it is the fundamental starting point that I recommend to anyone who’s interested in dog training. And Karen Pryor is one of the popularizers of clicker training as a way of shaping behavior. I believe she had experience with marine mammals, which by the way, you can’t whack on the butt with a newspaper to punish them, so in other words, negative reinforcement. So how do you do it? You use positive reinforcement. You use clickers or whistles or different tools. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And I believe the back of the book, people will be able to fact-check this, but it basically says whether you want to get your dog to heel, your cat to stop laying on the kitchen table, or your mother-in-law to stop nagging you, the principles are all the same. And at the end of it, like you said, is this radical ownership of “It may not be your fault, but it is your responsibility.” Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: And in a lot of cases, certainly with game design and instructions and so on, it is actually your fault. If people are confused, it is your fault. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no, but it’s the best way. Before I started Exploding Kittens, I designed games for friends and I just had the hardest time. When I wasn’t in the room, people were not enjoying those games. And it was only once I read that book that I realized the fault is absolutely mine. Because I’m trying to get them to have as much fun as I want them to have and the fact that they’re not, I keep blaming them. And that’s so wrong. Tim Ferriss: So what did you do? How did you fix that? Elan Lee: There’s basically two parts. One starts with design. One says the game has to be so simple that it is almost self-correcting. And I have to strip out all complication, I have to remove all nuance. Any time I’m thinking of the rules and I say, “Okay, if this happens, then this happens, except if — ” The moment I say “except,” I’ve gone down a wrong path. I need to get rid of all of that stuff. That was the first part. And then the second part is in writing the actual instructions and figuring out how — if I’m sitting in the room, you’re going to get this game because I’m going to explain it and I’m going to be enthusiastic. And when you ask a question, I’m going to answer the question. And when you get confused, I’m going to clarify it. I can a hundred percent do that. But a piece of paper trying to do that same thing, I have to write it as if I’m in the room and I have to anticipate those questions and I have to cut them off before they come up and I have to correct behavior because I know exactly where you’re going to go off course and fix it in the instructions. And that kind of one-two punch changed my game design from like 10 percent of the people get this to 95 percent of the people get this. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, one aspect — I mean there’s so many aspects, but one aspect of this that I enjoyed was related to the instructions. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And so number one, you make it really clear in the instructions, which we both poured over ad nauseum. But reading is the worst way to learn a game. Go watch this video, QR code. So that’s number one. But if you’re going to put it into text — and I think I’m pretty good at this, but I was very impressed with your ability to identify anything that could be misunderstood or that wasn’t yet defined or that could be taken with another more broader connotation that would steer people off course. And the number of edits in that Google Doc. Elan Lee: I mean, it’s got to be in the hundreds, right? Tim Ferriss: From all of us, hundreds and hundreds of edits. Elan Lee: So the most important skill is you will write better instructions, you will convey information to people better if you can clear your mind. If you can approach any set of instructions from the perspective of the things I know I do not yet know, and the words that come out of my mouth have to not only fill my brain with the required knowledge — Tim Ferriss: I see basically beginner’s mind, right? Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Putting yourself in the place of someone who has never seen this before. Elan Lee: Exactly. And it’s so hard to do because you have this information in your head. It must be there, otherwise you’re not going to be able to explain the thing. But to back all the way up and say, “I’m just going to split my brain in two. There’s this one reading script and I know the information I have to get out, but the other half is the recipient of that script and it knows nothing.” If you can do that — and it’s so hard, it takes so much practice. If you can do that, you’re going to not only be able to design good games and write good instructions, but you’re also going to be able to just converse more effectively just out in the world in general. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. All right. You mentioned I think it was two minutes to learn, 15 minutes to play. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: What other golden or guiding tenets do you have for yourself when you’re doing game design within Exploding Kittens? Elan Lee: Oh, good question. If a component does not need to be in the game, remove it from the game. Tim Ferriss: Right. So an example of that would be we had these chits or little chips, like poker chips. Elan Lee: Like bingo chips. Tim Ferriss: Like bingo chips that we were using for lives or strikes, and turns out you don’t need that. You can use — Elan Lee: Yeah, because you’ve got a whole thing of cards right here, just use those. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You can use cards by flipping them over and using the back of the card. Elan Lee: Exactly. That’s a perfect example. Right? We have this thing where we’re like, “Hey, you know what would be fun is if everybody had a big hand of cards and we’re going to play cards and you make decisions.” I’m like, “I get that.” Most games you play, you have a hand of cards and you’re going to play a card and you’re making a decision. That’s awesome. But you know what? That’s a private moment and you reveal a card. Every game you’ve ever played. When you play UNO, you’ve got a hand of cards, you’re making a decision, you play a card, you’ve revealed what card you just played. And I remember thinking, “Is there a simpler version of that?” And it turns out there is. And the simpler version in Coyote is take some cards, put them all face up on the table, and then decide which one you’re going to pick. That’s very similar to having a deck of cards, but now it’s public. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it’s public. Elan Lee: Right? Tim Ferriss: And also when the competitive version was brought in, which is the way that I like to play, the way I would suggest people play, but you can warm up with cooperative or if you have somebody in your life or in your family who just cannot lose without creating a huge pain in the ass, then the cooperative mode is really fun. But the competitive mode then allows the group decision on which card to play potentially, although ultimately that’s individual. That has implications for cooperative when it’s public. But also for competitive. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: There are a number of tweaks made to this, but I mentioned earlier, sabotaging. So we had competitive, but different minds are wired for different games. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And so, God forbid, what happens to you is what happened to one of my employees who was play testing this, where one of the people in the group was a mathematician who also is high-level chess player if I remember correctly. Elan Lee: Oh, no. Tim Ferriss: And he just smoked everyone because he had the mind for it. Elan Lee: Yeah, of course. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So what do you do for that? Well, we ended up — and this took a lot of play testing to ultimately land on this. And I want to ask you about play testing, particularly if it’s kind of hands off the wheel and you have people playing the game without you. Elan Lee: Yeah, terrifying Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Realized — and this comes back to the underdog being able to win, not getting my ass smoked in Magic over and over again by someone who’s just got better hardwiring for it. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: And that’s where the attack cards came from. Right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So there are these attack cards in the deck, which to the simplification side, you can play in cooperative mode to modify a card. I don’t want to get too in the weeds. Elan Lee: Well, I want to give you more credit for this because I don’t think you’re taking enough credit. All right, let me phrase this a different way. So the basic premise of the game is we have a whole bunch of activities on the table, right? Ballerina, peace sign, whatever it is, thumbs up, thumbs down, smile, frown. Tim Ferriss: Lean and make a fart noise. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly, lean and make a fart noise. So we’ve got all these things that we’re all going to do. And then on top of that — Tim Ferriss: It’s a fan favorite. Elan Lee: That’s right. That’s such a good card. On top of that, we have all these modifier cards and they modify — you have to skip a player after this one, ignore this card, do this one twice. Tim Ferriss: Those are generally the Coyote cards. Elan Lee: The Coyote cards. And you had this great idea, you said, “Because some players are naturally gifted at this game, far more so than others, and because some players are going to naturally fall behind and they need a way to sabotage the first place.” If you’re in last place, you need a way to sabotage the first place player. If you’ve ever played Mario Kart, you know this feeling very well. And you said, “What if we took some of these modifiers, every time — all players have to do all the blue cards with one hand instead of two.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: But what if instead of all the blue — Tim Ferriss: Or Tyrannosaurus arms. Elan Lee: Or Tyrannosaurus arms, you have to do all your movements with Tyrannosaurus arms. What if instead of playing that on all blue cards on the table, what if you just put that, slide it right in front of another player and now only they have to do it? For every single one of their turns. You’ve put a curse on them. The last place player has attacked the first place player. And I remember thinking, “Tim, you’re like a natural game designer.” That’s such a nice moment and it’s such an easy modification. And of course my answer was, “I don’t know, let’s try it.” And then we tried it and it was glorious. And I love moments like that for two reasons. One is because you had learned at that point to speak like a game designer. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: Instead of saying, “I think we just need to sabotage people,” instead you said, “Some people are really good at this game. We have to address that. Some people are naturally bad at this game. We need to give them a tool.” And those terms, speaking in that language, armed with that vocabulary, suddenly the answer to you became so clear, like, “Here’s how we solve those problems.” That’s great. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: I guarantee you would not have been capable of that when we started this process. Tim Ferriss: No way. Yeah, no, I wouldn’t have had the — sometimes artists talk about the visual library, just the exposure to different types of artwork, different forms, different silhouettes, different structures so that they can pull from that visual library to inform whatever they’re trying to build or solve for. And it’s the same with game design, same with everything. You need to build your ABCs so you can convey what you’re trying to say in terms that are solvable, if that makes any sense. Elan Lee: Yeah. Totally. You’re a quick study too. Tim Ferriss: Helped getting the books that you recommended. All right, so I’m not going to dox my friend in question. But as long-term listeners will know, I was, in a former life, a neuroscience major and then, in the last 10 years, have funded a lot of science. I always have just had this hankering and this dream of being involved in neuroscience; it continues to this day. And in the process of building this game — and this is not how I necessarily sell it, because this is going to sound terrible, but through many experiments with different companies and so on, I’ve concluded that even though generally Americans, I’ll throw it on Americans, I’m American, say they want to be smarter, they will typically not pay for something that is designed to make them smarter unless it’s a magic pill, and then sometimes the answer is yes. But what I was hoping to also do with this game is to create something that would — and this has not been proven, there’s no randomized controlled study examining this, although that might change at some point. — is to design something that would help those players who are not good at this, or the people who are in the middle of the bell curve or the people who are good to get better. And for people who are interested in looking at some — they’re not perfect analogs, but they’re similar. People can check out the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, WCST. It’s a neurophysiological test used to assess cognitive flexibility in executive functions, particularly the ability to shift cognitive sets and learn from feedback. All right, so participants must sort cards based on an initially unknown rule, which changes after a certain number of correct sorts. Now this is not a perfect parallel because that does not, in and of itself, make for a fun game. Right? Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: So fun number one, lots of probably rank ordered like one, two, three, four, five. But could I also Trojan horse in — Elan Lee: Yeah, love it. Tim Ferriss: — cognitive training. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And I think the answer — this is from a lay perspective, and obviously I’m biased because I’m involved in every step, I’m making this thing, but I think it does the trick. And what people will notice is, and you know this too, the game starts off so easy. Elan Lee: There’s nothing to it. Tim Ferriss: And people are like, “There’s nothing to it.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And then once a modifier or two comes out, people are like, “Oh, oh, wait a second, this is getting really tricky.” And if, for instance, I’ve had lifelong insomnia, you want to sleep better, play this game before you go to bed. And by the end you will feel like you just did a workout, a full brain workout for your cognition. Elan Lee: You know what I love about that part? I learned to play the drums years and years ago, and I remember I would learn these new patterns and it was like your right hand has to do this and your left hand has to do this, and your right leg has to do this and your — and I remember thinking, “No way, no way. I can’t do that.” And you work at it and you work at it and you work at it and suddenly it starts to click, just a little bit. Like, “Oh, my right hand did the right thing.” And it’s like you can feel new neurons coming to life. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: Your brain is doing something that five minutes ago you could not do. This is the first game I’ve ever played that does that exact same thing. And I remember the first time I felt that way in a very early play test, my eyes got all wide and I was like, “There is something magical going on here. I know I’m psyching myself out, but I feel new things happening in my brain because five minutes ago I could not do this pattern and now I can. We can go all the way around the table and you can add a new card and I will still be able to do this pattern that I couldn’t do just five minutes ago.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, totally. And what’s cool as well is you get to see just how specialized certain minds are and where you might have an Achilles heel. So for instance, and this is true for some folks, we have the modifiers ranked by difficulty just so you can — because ultimately with Coyote, you’re in charge of how hard you make the game. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. That’s right. That’s right. Tim Ferriss: You are in full charge of how easy, moderate, or difficult you make it. And we didn’t even talk about how this game is designed to make you a game designer. We’ll talk about that with the blank cards. But this is a sort of creativity unlock as much as a game. That’s the intention behind it, which is part of the reason that I’m really excited to see what the hell it does when it’s released into the wild, which effectively is now. Elan Lee: That’s going to — Tim Ferriss: Now the specialization piece, I’ll just speak to that. So for instance, for me, skipping turns, skipping players, it is a blind spot. It is an Achilles heel for me. That’s true for quite a few folks. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But for other people, for instance, if we’re going around the table, most people would be familiar with “We Will Rock You.” Elan Lee: “We Will Rock You,” yeah. Tim Ferriss: So it’s like boom, boom, boom, boom. So the way you play the game is you go around is you go “Boom, boom,” and you can hit the table with your hands. You can do it with closed fists. You could probably clap it if you want, but it’s boom, boom. And then one person does the move. Like let’s take the ballet, we’re going to do a pirouette. You have to do the motion and you have to say the motion. So then these two things can be split or confused later. We want to get — Elan Lee: We’ll get to that later. Tim Ferriss: — too deep into that. And then it’s boom, boom, next person, boom, boom, next person. And it goes around. And then it just gets more and more complicated. So I remember when we were first experimenting with the modifier that said, okay, it’s now three bumps instead of two. So it’s boom, boom, boom. And then the move. And there were, I remember, I’m not going to call them out, but there’s one person who just could not do it. Elan Lee: I know. I was one of those people. My brain would start melting out of my ears at that point. I don’t know why though. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. It’s weird. It’s weird. So they’re very specific. You’ll find each person will have a super strength and a super weakness, and you’ll figure it out by playing this game. And just from a game design perspective also, I’d love to hear you talk about finding the sweet spot. I mean, we could talk about Bushnell’s law of Atari fame, the game, I’m paraphrasing here, but a good game is easy to learn and difficult to master. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But how do you, in the course of play testing, working with prototypes find the sweet spot of difficulty? Because with this game, well, through making this game, I’ve just really come to appreciate how hard it is to create a game where people experience that sweet spot. Because if you were to take Coyote and make it too easy, what a simple game to make. Elan Lee: Sure. Tim Ferriss: Right? Elan Lee: Oh, yeah. Tim Ferriss: If you wanted to make it basically impossible and not fun to play, also very easy. But to find that sweet spot on the graph is incredibly challenging. Elan Lee: Yeah. So the way I think about this is when you first encounter any game, the first thought that has to go into your brain is, “I can do that.” You hear it described, and you have to think, “I can do that.” And then you have to try the game and that has to be reinforced. The game has to say, “Yep, you can do that.” And you have to feel like, “Okay, I thought I could do it. I can do it. This is great.” But that’s only going to last a few seconds. The next thought that has to go into your brain is, “I understand the path to mastery. I understand how to get better at this.” And then the next thought is, “And I can do that too.” So you have to see the moment a modifier card comes out, or the moment any complication happens in your favorite game, it has to stop you dead in your tracks. It has to be like, “Ooh, the thing I just did to start the game and was really good at, I thought I could do it. I could do it. That’s not going to work here. I have to rethink my strategy, or I have to get better at something else.” And then those two follow-up thoughts have to show up in quick succession: “I know what I have to do and I can do that too.” And that’s really the art to me of that ramping up of game design. And you have to keep hitting that “I think I can do that”; “Yes, you can. Now you can’t anymore, but you know what you have to do and you can do that too.” And then that’s going to get blocked. And you think, “Okay, now what? Now I know what I have to do and I can do that too.” And you have to just keep hitting those two things. And it’s rinse and repeat over and over and over again. And if you can hit that, you are just holding somebody’s hand from the beginning of the game to the end of the game. And they’re going to get great at it, they’re going to achieve that sense of mastery over time. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, and if you, listening or watching, have any game that you consider simple that you enjoy, rest assured there was an absurd, absurd amount of development and testing and revising that went into it. And just to give you an example, this is by all outward appearance a very simple game. And the three to eight players you could probably play with more, 10 minutes, says age is 10 plus. I’ve seen people playing with their kids who are much younger and it’s actually hilarious and super fun. There are so many levers you can pull here. You have the action cards, which are these cute little salamander cards with the different motions and gestures and so on. You’ve got just the sheer number of cards. How many variants do you have? How many total cards do you have? How many Coyote versus attack cards? When you have a fully shuffled deck, what does that actually look like? There’s so many different variables that you have to think through. Elan Lee: Yeah. And we even set up, one of my favorite things is we’re starting to see people compete now. So we set up this page of, here are table configurations. Here’s an array of cards in exactly this order with exactly these modifiers. This one’s hard, this one’s impossible. This one is going to kill you. And we’ve started to see, the game is barely available so far, but we started to see some people try to tackle those challenges. Tim Ferriss: Oh, fun. Okay. I didn’t even know that. Elan Lee: It’s incredible. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, so where this came from also is in The 4-Hour Chef a million years ago, came out in 2012, which was actually a book about accelerated learning, confusingly. But putting that aside, there were a few recipes in that book. I think one was called Dragon Force Chaconne or something like that, which was named after this video game track that people found impossible to play on guitar. And then there was something, a La Ancienne, which was this just ludicrously complex French dish that involved fish. And I was like, okay, look, if you’ve done everything up to this point and you want to take a quantum leap forward and try something that is considered effectively impossible by most people, here you go. And so that’s what we created on this particular page. Elan Lee: I will just say, having tested all of the challenges on that page, I can do exactly one of them. The last two are so hard. Tim Ferriss: They really are. Elan Lee: And we’ve already seen someone, a table of six people succeed — Tim Ferriss: Oh, wow. Okay — Elan Lee: — at the middle one. They’ve already done it. Tim Ferriss: That’s nuts. Elan Lee: Yeah. I’ve never seen anyone do the crazy hard one. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: But it’s coming. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So people can check it out. And there may or may not be a bunch of excitement around that. So I will just say there may be incentives later to be good at this game. I will leave it at that for now. So I tell you what, we’re going to come back to some of the blank cards and we’ll talk about those features. But let’s talk about a bit more of the process of making any game. We could talk about Coyote specifically of course, because you have a process for this. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: How many games per year do you guys put out on average? Elan Lee: So it’s funny, I actually built this out as a graph. So our first year we did one, our second year we did two. Our third year we did two again. Last year we did 14. This year we’ll do 23, I think. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Elan Lee: Yeah, it’s a lot. But we’ve built this, it’s really fun, we’ve built this incredibly robust pipeline from design all the way through to testing and then sales and then marketing. And I feel obligated to just keep that pipeline full because it’s such a beautiful thing we built. So we do a lot of games. Tim Ferriss: All right, let’s get some info that we wouldn’t normally have any access to. Elan Lee: All right. Tim Ferriss: If you do an 80/20 analysis, it’s not going to be exactly 80/20, but you get where I’m going, on your best-selling games, what’s on the leaderboard? What are the top X number of games? Five, three, four, whatever the number. Elan Lee: Well, up until last year, number one, the top-selling game in the world amongst all games was Exploding Kittens. Tim Ferriss: That’s nuts, man. Elan Lee: It’s nuts. Tim Ferriss: Congratulations. Elan Lee: It makes no sense, but I’ll tell you something I’m even more proud of. It’s now number two. Number one is a game called Hurry Up Chicken Butt. Hurry Up Chicken Butt is a game I designed with my four-year-old daughter, and she did most of the design. And it is outselling Exploding Kittens. It is selling one game every four seconds. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Elan Lee: Yeah, it’s nuts. And it was designed by a four-year-old. Tim Ferriss: Okay, so we’ve got a Hurry Up Chicken Butt, Exploding Kittens. Elan Lee: Yeah. The next few spots in the global sales are constantly shifting. Everybody’s fighting for those, but we always have — our entries into that list, which are constantly shifting, Poetry for Neanderthals is usually number three. Throw Throw Burrito is usually either number five or six, and the rest are just totally random. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Okay, got it. So what has made Hurry Up Chicken Butt a success? Elan Lee: Yeah. So remember what I said, if you have the best design game in the world — Tim Ferriss: And by the way, when we spoke I think two years ago — Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: — you were just beginning to talk about this. I don’t think it had launched at that point. Elan Lee: No, it hadn’t. Yeah. Yeah. It has been an absolute rocket ship. Tim Ferriss: What are the magic ingredients? Why has it worked? Because not all games do that. Elan Lee: Yeah. No, they don’t. Tim Ferriss: And you’ve had now, with the number of games that EK, Exploding Kittens, has developed, you’ve had a chance to see a lot of different ideas come through the doors and go out the doors. Elan Lee: Yeah. Some games last a season, some games last a decade. So when I was designing games — okay, so Hurry Up Chicken Butt in particular, I wrote a list of the things I wanted that game to accomplish. And my daughter had all these ideas, “Here’s what I want to do, and you’re going to do this and you’re going to run up and jump up and down and blah.” But I had a list of things that I needed to know were in this game in order for me as a parent to buy it for my kid. And they were as follows. The game has to be as much fun for me to play as it is for my daughter. That’s a hard one. Tim Ferriss: That’s hard. Elan Lee: That killed most designs that we came up with. Number two, my daughter has to be able to beat me at this game, even though I’m not letting her win. Holy crap is that a hard one. Tim Ferriss: Yep. Elan Lee: Number three, the game cannot have any losers. It can have a winner, but it cannot have any losers. Those three were my guiding lights. It was like, I need to check off these three check boxes for this game to be good. And we worked on a hundred million designs. She’s great. She’ll just be like, “Oh, you don’t like this one? Here’s another one. You don’t like that one? Here’s another one.” And she just kept firing them off. And we finally got to this game that hit all three of those. That, as I said earlier, is only half the battle. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, that’s the necessary, but not sufficient — Elan Lee: Exactly. So now we have a game that I’m in love with, that we play every single night that she can beat me at regularly. And I am trying my absolute hardest to beat her. And this four-year-old is kicking my ass at this game. Love that. Love it. And I’m having a blast. Tim Ferriss: So this is my first time hearing about these criteria. Just for people listening, this is all new to me. Elan Lee: When my daughter got old enough to start playing games right around when she turned four, we went out and bought all these games and I just hated them. They were so boring and I hated playing. And so we just designed our own. We just made them better. And it was important for me to have that list. ‘Cause unless I know what success looks like, I’ll just stay in brainstorming mode forever. So I made that list, finally hit it, and then we entered into part two. And here my daughter has very little to do with it. Here’s where I sit down with the marketing and sales team and I was like, “What the hell are we going to call this thing?” And we went through a thousand different names. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I know the feeling. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, we did that. But once I had 10 names that I really liked, we sat down with my daughter and all her friends and I would just read them off. And there was no contest. I got to Hurry Up Chicken Butt and they’re like just laughing hysterically, jumping up and down. They didn’t even want to hear the rest of the names. I was like, okay. Sold. So that was a really nice step forward. It was like, I know I’ve got a game that’s just fire for kids. They’re just so excited about this. And the next thing was, all right, well what do we make this box look like? And I was like, I know it has to be — the game itself involves a character and a die shaker and some sound effects. It’s got all this stuff packed into this character, this chicken. And I was like, I can’t just hide that. I have to put that in a box where you can see it. And that was really hard. The difference between box design for an iPhone and a game is an iPhone will spend a hundred dollars on that box with the materials and making it beautiful. And when you open your iPhone, you take the box and you throw it away. In a game, you’ve got about 40 cents to spend on the box and it has to last forever. It sucks. The equation is totally backwards, but I needed a thing that displayed the chicken and told you it made noise and lets you shake around the die and still hold its structure as a box so that you could remove this thing, play with it, and then reinsert it into the box in a way that isn’t going to mess with the integrity of the box — its structural integrity. So that was really hard, but we finally solved that. And then — Tim Ferriss: Did you do that before or after you started testing the waters with retailers? Elan Lee: After. Tim Ferriss: After? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. I don’t want to hijack, but whenever it makes sense, I would love to know how, at what point you start testing the waters with Elan Lee: Well, we do this backwards. And when we started, you have to do it the opposite way. You have to walk into those sales pitches and you have to say, “Here’s the final product. Look how beautiful it is. You don’t have to trust us that this is going to sell. You can look at this thing and know that it’s going to sell.” For this game, luckily, because we have a really good track record, we walked in with no box. All I walked in with was a rough idea, a name scribbled on a piece of paper. And I said, “Trust me, this is going to be great. We’re going to solve everything. It’s going to be amazing.” And they said, “Okay, yeah, sold. Let’s buy it.” That comes from 10 years of pitching them hit after hit after hit. Tim Ferriss: I got it. So if it were earlier in Exploding Kittens’ existence, you go in with the finished box. Elan Lee: Yeah. They’re never taking a flyer on that. Tim Ferriss: Who creates the finished box? Do you guys create it in-house? How do you prototype something like that? Elan Lee: Yeah, we have an incredible team. We have a large scale printer. We print on actual cardboard. We have a paper folder so we can actually build the boxes. Which was an investment, that’s not off-the-shelf machinery, but it helps — okay, so look, normally whatever manufacturer you’re working with, they send you a prototype box. Because they make it and they want you to see the final product and that’s what you go into the sales meetings with. You say, “Look, here’s the box. Here’s how much it’s going to weigh. Here’s the final presentation. We’ve been working on it for a year and a half. Here it is.” I walk into those meetings like, “I got an idea, I’ve been working on it for three weeks. I want you to buy it right now. I don’t have any materials to show you.” So it’s a different kind of pitch that I’m very proud of because I’ve earned that and we haven’t ever let them down. Tim Ferriss: So in the case of Coyote, there was a lot of play testing that was done before we ended up in line review meetings. Elan Lee: Yeah. Wow. We skipped that whole part, didn’t we? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. Elan Lee: All right. Tim Ferriss: So could you talk about your secret cabal of families? Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. Secret cabal of families. I love it. All right, so — Tim Ferriss: Another chapter for your memoir. Elan Lee: Yeah, right. That’s a good title there. So, okay, so here’s how most game companies test games. If you had partnered with a different games company, here’s what your experience would’ve been like. “All right, we got a game. We really like it. It’s really fun, lots of internal testing. Everyone’s on board. We now need external testing.” And they go to these market research groups and they pull strangers in and they sit in a room with a one-way mirror and they show the game and they play the game with people they don’t know and they order in some crappy catered lunch and they play the game and then they rate it on a scale of one to 10 and they fill out this form that’s like, “Here’s what I liked and here’s what I didn’t like and here’s what I would improve.” And then you get to watch those videos and they present you back all these forms and you get to make a determination. Okay. Nobody plays games like that. You don’t play games with strangers. When was the last time you played a board game with a stranger? Tim Ferriss: Can’t even remember. Elan Lee: It doesn’t happen. Right? The testing procedure that all these other companies go through is fundamentally flawed. They’re using a resource because it’s the only resource that exists. So I sat down, that’s what we did our first time. We went through one of those companies and they gave us all the results. And I looked at these results and I was like, oh, my God, we just burned $25,000 on this thing and it’s useless. So I realized at that moment, because nothing better exists, we’re going to have to build it ourselves. So I started reaching out to, at first our Kickstarter community and then our Discord community and then our Reddit community as we grow and grow and grow and said, “Look, I got a bunch of prototypes. I need families and friends who get together regularly to play games and I’m going to mail you a free game. You don’t even have to send it back to me, it’s yours forever. You get this amazing prototype. All I ask in return is upon receiving it within 24 hours, you play the game with your friends and family and you record the session and you send me that video. And that’s it. That’s all I want in return.” And within about 12 months, we had 400 families sign up for this thing. They are called our kiddie test pilots. And they’re this incredible group of enthusiastic game players that give us the best feedback. And we don’t have them fill out a questionnaire. All we ask them at the end of the test session, we say, “Look into the camera and answer one question. The only question we care about, do you want to play again?” And we know a game is ready when everybody looks into that lens and says, “Hell, yes!” And that’s it. That’s our testing process. Tim Ferriss: What are some of the pass/fail marks or green versus red signals that you look for? In other words, I imagine the response rate could vary, but you don’t know if that’s because people are busy or if it’s the wrong time of year or maybe they looked at the game, the box, and so on and it just didn’t sell them so they didn’t play it. Elan Lee: Totally. Tim Ferriss: Is that something you pay attention to? Are the people, I’m sure I’m not the only person wondering this, if they’re part of this special VIP get free game group, are they disincentivized to say, “Hell no, I would not play this game again.” So do you get a false positive signal? Elan Lee: I see. Tim Ferriss: How do you think through what constitutes a thumbs up versus a thumb sideways versus a thumbs down? Elan Lee: Yeah. There are a lot of false positives for sure. And there’s no way I can solve that problem. We prompt them in advance. We’re like, “Look, we need honestly — this game will get great if you tell us that something’s broken with it. We need to know that.” And they’re motivated because we also send them the final version of the game. So they know that’s coming, they know a better version is coming if they help us make it better. So some of the problem is solved that way, but not all of it. So that’s why the video is so important. Tim Ferriss: So they say, “We had a great time,” and you’re watching and you’re like, they are not having a great time. Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. Look, count the number of eye rolls. Or you know a great one, they’ll take the instructions — I love this. They’ll open the instructions. And when you see that eyes go wide and they inhale. Tim Ferriss: Pull back and they’re like — Elan Lee: It’s like, “Oh, fuck.” Tim Ferriss: Instruction apnea. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Oh, God. Elan Lee: Something, that’s terrible. Right? And that’s really important. And there’s no survey in the world they can fill out that’s going to tell me that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: You need to watch the moment they see the instructions. Tim Ferriss: Because they may not even realize they’re doing it. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly. Tim Ferriss: So how are they going to report it? Elan Lee: Yeah. And that’s why the video is so important. And we have very specific instructions for the video. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, what are they? Because I’m wondering how in the hell do you review 400 videos? Elan Lee: Oh, well one, we watch them at 4X speed and two is we’ve got a whole team of people that watch them and they flag moments. They don’t even say why this moment is important. Something happened here, something happened here. I’m going to go on to the next video now. And then the next group of people will go through and look at those flags and say, “Oh, big, deep inhale. Rules confusion.” Tim Ferriss: Nerd question, what do you use software wise for flagging stuff? Elan Lee: Vimeo. Tim Ferriss: Vimeo, okay. So you have people upload their videos to Vimeo? Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: Got it. Elan Lee: Yeah, so this whole process takes months and it’s really important. And the other thing is, I’ve got 400 test families, but I’m only going to send out five games at a time. The reason is I need to collect that feedback, make changes, and send out the next batch. Otherwise, I’ve got 10 results for a version and it’s useless. I know what the next five are going to be like ’cause I saw them on the first five. Tim Ferriss: I got it. So is it then, just to state my understanding, with the kiddie test pilots, you basically have — you’re not sending out the same version to 400, 600 people at once? Elan Lee: Five at a time. Tim Ferriss: Five at a time. And then you look at that cohort and see what comes back? Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. It’s always the same stuff. Tim Ferriss: Then you tweak and then it goes out to the next group. Elan Lee: Yeah, the next five. Tim Ferriss: Over what period of time do you get a prototype to the max number who are going to receive it? Elan Lee: Usually I would say six to eight months. And we’re tweaking two things. One is we’re tweaking gameplay, but much more commonly we’re tweaking the instructions. Because gameplay has already survived internal testing. So we know the game is fun. If we know this game is fun and then we watch a video of people not having fun, chances are it’s the instructions, not the game. And so that’s what we start attacking at that moment. Tim Ferriss: Got it. What are some of the risks of internal testing? ‘Cause I’ve always wondered, for instance, when I have, as I’m doing right now, doing a bunch of writing and I have people proofreading or test reading my writing, I do not only do it with professional writers. I mean they’re very good and I know I’m very fortunate to know some amazing writers, but they’re also a little too close to the material. It’s like a travel writer who can’t stop looking at their travel experience through the lens of a writer. They have lost the ability to just travel and have fun. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So what are some of the risks, if any, of internal testing? Elan Lee: So you and I have the same instinct here. I remember when we were testing this game internally, hadn’t gone out the door yet. Tim Ferriss: This game? Elan Lee: This game, Coyote. Yeah. I remember you would say, “Hey, can you show me test results? But can you have your accounting team test it instead of your game design team?” And I remember thinking, yeah, that’s what we do. I’m not interested in the game design team’s results. So I would show you the accounting team results and I would show you the sales people, the sales team’s results, who hadn’t even ever seen the game. Our internal testing starts out with the game design team, of course, but very quickly has to move on to the other teams, specifically the other teams who have never seen the game and don’t know the background. Because those are really the only tests that we care about. So your instinct is perfect there, and I’m very happy to say you didn’t have to teach us that, we already knew that part. Tim Ferriss: I mean, if I’m teaching you anything, I don’t know what it would be other than my obsessive focus on — I’m sorry for the volume of email and the volume of text messages and the volume of everything. Elan Lee: Every single one of those made the game better. Truly. Truly. I mean, okay, look, we’ve only done, we’ve done, I think two partnerships total. Three partnerships total. We did a game with Penn Jillette of Penn & Teller. We did a game with Jeff Probst of Survivor, and now we’ve done a game with Tim Ferriss. You probably sent more notes than the other two combined. Tim Ferriss: I sent a lot of notes. Sent a lot of notes. I really had a blast with it. And I remember this moment, and I’m wondering if this happened before or after the line review meetings. I think it might’ve been afterwards, but you could place it for me because this is my first game and I don’t put my name on anything. That was part of the very, very truthful pitch. It’s not like one of, I don’t have Tim Ferriss microwave enchiladas and Tim Ferriss sneakers. And then just as an aside, I have the Tim Ferriss game. It’s like, no, no, no, I don’t put my name on anything. So I take it very, very seriously. And I think it was, tell me if I’m getting this wrong, pretty sure it was Carly, who’s amazing. Elan Lee: Carly is the president of Exploding Kittens. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Carly is incredible. And because there’s always a fear, for me at least, where it’s like, maybe internally I think it’s great, and then it gets released into the wild and then, oh, shit there’s a real problem. Like Houston, we have a problem. Elan Lee: Yeah, and you can’t take it back. Tim Ferriss: Right. So what do you do? And I remember Carly, I want to say, sent a text to me. She was in, I want to say Germany at some type of gaming convention or meeting of distributors. I don’t remember the exact context, but she said Coyote was belle of the ball. She’s like, “You would not believe we had an entire huge room full of people playing, smashing on the tables over and over and over and over again.” And I was like, whew. Elan Lee: Yeah. Isn’t that a great feeling? Tim Ferriss: Okay, here we go, LFG. Elan Lee: She sent me a video of that. So just to set the stage there, there are 2,000 people that — sorry, there’s 2,000 people at this hotel of the 25 hotels that are part of this convention. And there’s one games room and there’s 10 tables in there. And the idea is there should be a different game at every table. And everyone’s testing out the games and sampling them. And we put Coyote on one table and almost immediately people started gathering around. And so those people said, “Can we just grab another copy and we’ll just put it on the next table just so not everyone has to gather around this one table?” ‘Cause it looked so intriguing. And so they sent it to another table. And then by the time Carly sent me a video, it was at every table in the room. It was just an entire hotel playing this one game because nobody wanted to play anything else. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, wild. Elan Lee: It was so neat. It was so neat. And how gratifying? We’ve been killing ourselves on this thing. And to see an audience receive it and say, thank you for the gift. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, totally. And also, I mean, I said it to you guys and look, it says technically it says age 10 plus. So I don’t want to contradict that, but if you’re willing to modify the rules, which is something that I encourage, and we have that in the instructions, house rules, feel free to modify the rules. But I sent you guys the video of my friend’s four-year-old after she played, which was like this — Elan Lee: So good! Tim Ferriss: It was such an amazing video. And this is the first thing I’ve ever done that can include families and kids directly/ Elan Lee: Easily. Tim Ferriss: Where it’s like, four-year-old, 10-year-old is not going to have any interest or necessarily the capacity to read one of my phone books that are like 600 pages long. It’s not going to happen. So this is also so much fun to finally now that it’s kind of released into the wild to start seeing these things bubbling up that I hoped would be there. Elan Lee: It’s the reason you make a game. You want to share an experience that then the recipients get to share with those people that they love. That’s why you make a game. That’s exactly what we’ve made here. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So let’s talk about the selling process a little bit more. Because you said, there’s the game development, there’s building the game, there’s crafting the game. But there is an equally important part, which is how do you get this thing into people’s hands? And for that you need distribution. So this is going to be a callback. Remember that line review at the very beginning and then I took us on a very meandering path, but there was a point to it. How do you pitch big retailers? How does that happen? And how did you do it in the beginning of Exploding Kittens and how — I know it’s changed over time as you’ve built your track record, but nonetheless you still need to do it. And actually, here’s a data point that most people will never hear anyone talk about. What percentage of your sales are offline retail versus online? Elan Lee: Yeah. All right, we’ll start there. Yeah, we never share these numbers, but for you, Tim — Tim Ferriss: Thank you. Elan Lee: — here we go. 70 percent of our sales are in-person retail. Only 30 percent are online sales. Totally backwards than what you’d expect for almost any industry. But yeah, people like to walk into a store, they like to see and touch and feel the game and flip it over and read the back and compare it to the other games. And that’s where we sell our games. Which means not only do I need tremendous retail buy-in, those sales meetings are so important, those line reviews. But also the game has to sell itself on the shelf. When you’re walking down that games aisle, 70 percent of our audience does this. You need to look at all the game, hundreds of games, and you need to stop dead in your tracks on this one. And you need to say, “Ooh, what’s that?” And that starts at that line review, starts with getting them to say, not only are we going to commit to this game, but we’re going to put it in multiple locations. So you see it more than once. Very important. Also, we work with them to figure out the color scheme. And you and I, we did tons of surveys on the color scheme and the character and everything to stop people in their tracks. Tim Ferriss: So just a quick sidebar. I know I keep doing this, but some of you may remember, and for those who never heard it I’ll just tell you, from my very first book, 4-Hour Workweek, I used Google AdWords to test the top, let’s just call it 10 title and subtitle contenders. So I bid on keywords that were related to the subject matter in the book. And then the sponsored results, the ads were automatically split tested, like multivariate tested by Google. They will do this automatically. And then all of the URLs, I had different URLs for each title option. They just took people to an under construction page. Because I didn’t care about conversion, I cared about interest, sufficient interest click. And that is how I figured out the title. And then for the cover, back in the day, I went to Borders, which was on University Ave. in Palo Alto. And I had a counter, like you might see from a bouncer at the front of a club. And I put different covers onto a book of the same dimensions on the shelf. Elan Lee: Oh, wow. Tim Ferriss: I guess I didn’t tell you this. Under the new nonfiction. Elan Lee: Oh, my God. Tim Ferriss: And I just, during the peak hours over a couple of days, I just tracked the number of times it got picked up. Elan Lee: Oh, that’s so good. Tim Ferriss: And then I used that to determine which cover to use. Elan Lee: I love this, I love this. Tim Ferriss: Now there are better or certainly easier tools to use. So we ended up, there are a number of them, I’ll just mention a few. So we used PickFu, P-I-C-K-F-U.com. There’s also Intellivy, I-N-T-E-L-L-I-V-Y, and then there’s another one called Stickybeak also. But these allow you to do roughly the same thing, which is you can take, for instance, with this box design or any type of art, or you could probably do it with copy, many different things. You can survey people who fit a particular demographic. And so you could identify whatever the ages, the gender, if they are members of a particular service, whether they have Prime membership or this membership or that membership. You can fine slice it however you want, and then you can serve up variants. So for this coyote who you see on the cover, I’ll explain for the people, basically the box looks like a slightly enlarged box for a deck of cards and then the top of the box is this beautiful autumnal orange, almost a saffron, like Buddhist robe. Elan Lee: We spent so much time on this color. Tim Ferriss: We spent so much time on this, it is impossible to overstate how much time I spent on this and everybody spent on it. Then there’s this beautiful lime green. I remember taking photographs of particular leaves at particular times of the year with light coming through it to identify the hexadecimal or Pantone numbers for this particular grain. Elan Lee: Oh, I remember this well, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, you remember it, you remember it. And then looking at color theory and the color wheel and, oh, my God, it went on and on. But above the coyote which is in the center of the box, there is this upper portion of a cartoon coyote’s head and very much trickster. Where it ended up is there’s a little hat on the coyote, there’s an earring, there’s a wink and the snout is where it’s cut off so you don’t see the nose. And this was originally, I remember sketching this initially on a Zoom call by pen and paper and then holding it up to the Zoom call to the camera and then later sending the scan and then we worked from there. But we had variants with no hat, we had variants with no earring, we had variants with both eyes open looking to camera, so to speak, we had both eyes open looking in one direction off to the side and we were able to very quickly get a very good statistical signal on what people preferred. Elan Lee: Yes. However — Tim Ferriss: However. Elan Lee: — to your credit, when you showed me that character, I think, initially, both the coyote’s eyes were open and we had some questions about the hat and I remember asking you all these questions. “What do you think of a wink? What do you think of an earring? What do you think of a hat? What do you think of one eye closed? With both eyes closed? What do you think? What do you think?” And to your credit, your answer was always “Let’s test it. I don’t want to have an opinion about this, I do have an opinion but I don’t even want to tell you, let’s test it.” And that is such an intelligent way to approach this. And ultimately, this beautiful character that we ended up with was so clearly the winner, it wasn’t even close. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it wasn’t even close. And so we were able to get this very strong signal from thousands of people voting and, boom, here we are. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So, we were talking about the road to retail. So it’s 70 percent of your sales are in-person retail versus online. Elan Lee: Yeah, right. Tim Ferriss: And, therefore, the stakes are high for these line reviews. Elan Lee: Yeah, line reviews are a big deal. And I remember, so we really wanted to all show up in person. I remember you were trying so hard to get — our first line review was with Walmart in Bentonville, Arkansas. I remember you wanted so badly to be there and there was some scheduling conflict that just wasn’t going to let it happen. And we tried to change the date but, again, they’ve got so many meetings and you’ve got to get in in exactly this time and they couldn’t change it to anything appropriate. And I remember thinking, “Oh, we’re sunk, I don’t know how to sell this game without Tim there in the room showing how much passion he has.” And you had a great solve, you just recorded a video of all that passion and you sat down in front of the camera and you just riffed on the game. You were just like, “Here’s why I love this, here’s why this is important to me, here’s why I made this game, first time I put my name on a thing,” and you recorded this beautiful and passionate video. And I remember walking into the line review and sitting down and saying, “I have a new game. First thing I’m going to do is we’re going to play this game and I’m not going to tell you anything about it, we’re just going to play this game.” And I set up the game and, within five minutes, they’re laughing and they’re having this incredible time and they’re like, “Oh, this is amazing, this is so much fun. How are you going to sell this thing?” And I said, “I’m going to play a video for you now,” and that was it. It was that one-two punch. It was we’ve nailed game design and we’ve nailed the pitch, we know exactly who to talk to and how to talk to them. And they saw those two elements and they’re full line purchase, every single store is getting this game. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, wild, yeah. Elan Lee: That has never happened on an initial pitch for us ever. Normally, we get into a subset of stores and then, eventually, it rolls out to all the stores. This was the first time ever they said, “Whatever it takes, we need this game everywhere.” Tim Ferriss: Which is still very surreal for me and I’m so grateful, obviously, and it’s terrifying at the same time. Not going to lie, this is mister dip the toe, then one foot, then wade up to the ankles, this is just — Elan Lee: Yeah, fire hose on. Tim Ferriss: — full Monty from second zero. What are other keys to pitching in a line review? And that could also be, I’ll just offer another option, which is what are some common mistakes that people make or that you suspect people make? Elan Lee: Okay. So, the first most common mistake — Tim Ferriss: Because this could be for games but it could be for — Elan Lee: It’s for anything, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — cosmetics, it could be for anything. Elan Lee: For anything. The first question is how are you represented in that room? Remember I said they only take a certain number of meetings, it took us five years to get one of those meetings. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Elan Lee: And the way that you get the — Tim Ferriss: Even with the thunderous, crazy lightning-in-a-bottle success of Exploding Kittens? Elan Lee: They only have so many hours. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Yeah. So what you have to do instead is you find someone who already has a meeting and you hire them as your publisher and then they represent your game in their meeting. That’s how most companies do it and that’s how we did it for years. So the first problem is you have to make sure that whoever’s representing you, assuming you can’t be in the room because 99.9 percent of the people can’t, they are representing you the right way. With enough attention, they’re pitching it the right way, they’re representing it the right way, they’re saying the right words, they’re conveying the right fun. Tim Ferriss: How do you ensure that? Elan Lee: It’s a personal relationship and you — It’s just hard, it’s really hard. And to be honest, I don’t want to name names, but we went through three different publishers and I wasn’t happy with how — Tim Ferriss: How did you, this may or may not be something you can talk about, but how did you craft the deal structure such that you could take a swing and then you’re like, “Okay, swing and a miss, we’re going to go to someone else. And then swing and a miss, we’re going to go to someone else.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: How are those deals structured? Elan Lee: We got very lucky. Because our Kickstarter campaign was so through the roof, that fed into our Amazon sales immediately. And so I could go from publisher to publisher saying, “Look how many games I sold the last week, look how many I sold the week before that. This is a prestigious title that you want to represent.” And then when they wouldn’t represent me properly, wouldn’t get the right sales, couldn’t get the right deal structure in place because we also demand quite a bit as far as where the game is placed, is it in aisle, is it out of aisle, meaning is it in the game section or somewhere else. Tim Ferriss: Ankle height versus eye height. Elan Lee: Exactly, right. Those bottom shelves are like a death sentence, nobody looks down there. Can we get games at checkout where they’re selling chewing gum, can we put games there? Can we get games in the catalog? All this stuff that I wanted for our games was just not being properly represented for us. So, eventually, after our sales got high enough, I finally was able to stop doing that silly dance with these publishers and we were able to publish our own games. Tim Ferriss: Quick question. So, if I’m hearing you correctly, the success of the direct to consumer, the DTC, Kickstarter, Amazon, I should say online, those successes allowed you to dictate certain deal terms with the publishers so you had flexibility. Elan Lee: Correct. And they allow us to say you want to represent us. Because, even then, they only have a one, maybe two-hour meeting and so there’s only so many games they can pitch so how do they fill that library. Tim Ferriss: And then you get to the point where you can go and book those meetings yourself. How important was having a critical mass of SKUs? Elan Lee: Oh, it’s everything, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Because I have to imagine, if I’m a major retailer, I don’t want to have a meeting with someone who only has one thing to sell. Elan Lee: Well, that’s why we couldn’t do it at first. It was only once we had, I think, 10 games was the magic number to make it worth their while. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Okay, got it. Elan Lee: Yeah. And that takes a long time. And it’s not just 10 games, it’s 10 bestsellers. And unless you’re there, they’re just like, “Yeah, just go through a publisher. We don’t have time for — “ Tim Ferriss: Don’t have time. Elan Lee: We take 10 meetings, we don’t have time for an 11th. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. All right, so what have you learned understanding but, to the extent possible, if we can put aside the element of Exploding Kittens having and developing this incredible track record which allows you to not cut corners in a bad way but you can go in without a finished prototype of the box, et cetera. If we put that aside for the moment, what have you learned about line reviews if you look at your first outing versus — Elan Lee: Yeah. Oh, I love this. Tim Ferriss: — the more refined line reviews? Elan Lee: Yeah, okay. Tim Ferriss: And I’m spending a lot of time on this, guys, because this applies to everything. It applies to so much. You have a movie? Okay, fine, how are people going to see the movie? Yeah, you can go direct but you might want a distribution partner. What we’re talking about will apply to that pitch meeting, a lot of it. And it’s the stuff that mainstream magic is made of is figuring out how to craft these meetings. Elan Lee: Yeah. Remember you said, “Like it or not, you’re in sales?” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Here it is. This is where the rubber meets the road. Dust off your tap dancing shoes because, holy crap, these are tough. So you have to walk into that meeting and first you have to keep in mind you are their 10th meeting. Even if you’re not their 10th meeting, you’re their 10th meeting. They’re in this “I’m tired, I want to get out of this room, I’ve been at this for too long,” they’re in that mindset. So the first thing you’ve got to do is get them out of that funk. You need them to understand that this is going to be the best of the 10 meetings. And you do that with enthusiasm, you do that with props, you do that with a cool video. The stuff that can get them out of, “Oh, this isn’t like the other meetings.” Cool, that’s where you start. So we walk into the room with two of those suitcases, not the ones that fit in the overhead, the big crazy ones you have to check and they’re filled with games, the most beautiful games we’ve got. Even stuff that we’re not pitching that day, even stuff we know will never see the light of day because we’re going to set all of those up. And the basic premise is buy into this world. Exploding Kittens is not a product, it’s a whole world and you can have this world on your store shelves. And so that’s how we start and that’s a really nice way to start. Okay. Then what they’re expecting is, “Okay, pitch us a game one at a time. Pitch this, okay, you’re done. Okay, pitch the next one. Okay, you’re done. Pitch the next one.” What we do is very different. Instead of pitching a game and then pitching the next one, just like I said, for Coyote, we’re like, “Hey, we’re going to play a game.” And usually they say, “We don’t have time to play, can you just pitch it?” And I say, “No, we’re going to play a game.” Confrontation, I get it, but I force them to play the games, every single one of them. Now, I’m not going to play all the way through, I’m not going to spend 10 or 20 minutes. Tim Ferriss: All right. This might seem like a trivial detail but I don’t think it is. You in a tuxedo and a top hat for this? Are you dressed in your Sunday’s finest? Elan Lee: Oh, yeah. Oh, it’s so funny. So I learned this in my Microsoft days. If I dress up, if I wear a tuxedo, if I wear a suit, if I even wear a button-up shirt, nobody takes me seriously because I’m supposed to be the creative guy. I have to wear the creative guy uniform, I have to wear a t-shirt, I have to wear jeans, otherwise, no one looks at me. So that’s how I show up. Luckily, it’s a really comfortable uniform for me. So I force them to play and I’m there being the game’s biggest cheerleader. I don’t usually let them win, but I usually orchestrate a scenario in the game where they’re having as much fun as possible. And my goal is for them to have exactly those emotions that we talked about. When we start, I need them to think I can do that. And then, a minute in, I need them to think, “Oh, I did that. What’s next? Oh, I can do that next thing too.” And I am just crafting that. And right at the point where they’re like, “Oh, I know what the next thing is,” I pull the game away. We’re done playing, now let me tell you how we’re going to sell this game. And it’s because, at that point, they’re drooling. And I do that 10 times in a meeting and we just keep hitting that over and over. And I am very aware that the last two games I pitch are usually not going to be purchased because they’re exhausted because that roller coaster — they’ve been up and down too many times. Tim Ferriss: Right. So, you’re going to have to figure out the sequence. Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Do you start with the game you hope is going to be the big purchase? How do you sequence it? Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. We open with our shortest, easiest pitch and what that usually is an Exploding Kittens expansion. So, if I need to sell an expansion box or a new Exploding Kittens product and I know I don’t have to work very hard to sell it because they always sell, that’ll take the first spot. That just warms the waters, gets us all eased in. Tim Ferriss: A little yes momentum. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: Doesn’t hurt. Elan Lee: Yeah. The number two spot is the glory spot. Tim Ferriss: Okay, got it. Elan Lee: Whoever is there, that’s the game I’m actually pitching today. That’s where Coyote was, that’s the big thing we’re going to talk about. And then the next five are equal, it doesn’t matter what order they are, those are — usually we’ll sell all five of those. At a typical meeting, all five. What happens after that is very iffy. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Now you mentioned you play the game, you get them super excited, hopefully, they’re drooling over it and then you say, “All right, I’m going to take the game away, here’s how we’re going to sell it.” What is included in the “Here’s how we’re going to sell it?” Elan Lee: Oh, yeah, okay. So important. So this has changed over the last three years. It used to be I have to start with the box and we still — I shouldn’t say it used to be, it still is, we start with the box. “Look how beautiful this thing is,” and we do a mock-up, here’s how it looks on the shelf and it’s usually from a photograph we took that morning. We want to show you, “Hey, Target, here’s what your shelf looks like. Hey, Walmart, here’s what your shelf looks like. Here is our game right there in line.” Tim Ferriss: And I should mention, this probably goes without saying, but you are not just showing up and winging it, you guys — Elan Lee: Oh, my God. Tim Ferriss: — rehearse like you are going to be performing once in a lifetime at Carnegie Hall. Elan Lee: It is, if we screw up this meeting, our company is screwed. We don’t survive a bad meeting so, yeah, there is nothing that matters more than this. This is, arguably, 70 percent of our business this year. If we mess up this meeting, we will see a 70 percent drop. If they bought zero games, I don’t know that our company would survive that, so it’s a big deal. We rehearse constantly, we make changes constantly, we make all these props. We try to get the spot either right after breakfast or right after lunch because that’s when they’re in the best moods. All of it is orchestrated and so carefully. Who’s in the meeting? How many chairs are we going to fill? Tim Ferriss: How do you request those time slots? Because I imagine you’re not the only people who are thinking about this, right? It makes me think of the data, it’s a meta-analysis long ago looking at judges’ verdicts before or after meals and leniency, right? Elan Lee: Yeah, right. So, how do you get the right slots, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So, how do you angle for those? Elan Lee: There’s an art to that as well. So we have agents, we have representatives, one for Target and one for Walmart, and these are people who live in those cities, and they live and breathe sales with the sales rep. So, their job is — the very cynical way to say it is they’re like lobbyists but the more — Tim Ferriss: Ambassadors. Elan Lee: Ambassadors, there we go. That’s a much more appropriate way. They have been doing the job for longer than the salespeople have, longer than the buyers have. And as a result, the relationship that they have with the buyers is actually one of education because they’ve seen all the mistakes, they know where all the landmines are, they know how to avoid them. And so part of the art of getting the best meetings, of getting yourself set up the best, is to hire the best agent. Tim Ferriss: How does someone find said agents? Elan Lee: Friends of friends of friends. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: The best ones already have too many clients. You can’t work with them. Tim Ferriss: Right, the usual situation. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly. But if you have a good enough brand, if you have the right relationships, if you can talk to the right people and if you’re persistent, you can get the right agents. I actually thought we didn’t need an agent at all at first. I was like, “We can just do it, we’re going to show up the day before, we’re going to walk into these meetings,” and some very good friends of mine in the industry said, “You are an idiot, it’s just not going to work.” So we started working with agents and they’re incredible. They know the industry, they can — Tim Ferriss: Now, just to dig into that a little, why wouldn’t that work? Is it that the code of etiquette and the way everything has been set up involves those agents and, therefore, it wouldn’t work or are there other reasons why going in guns blazing without representation wouldn’t work? Elan Lee: Yeah, both. The answer is both. So the buyers are much less likely to take you seriously unless you have an agent in the room. And part of that is just because — Tim Ferriss: I guess part of it is just these fools don’t know how this is done. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: Right. They’re showing up to Downton Abbey wearing a tank top. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: And they don’t know how to use the silverware. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: Why should I trust their ability to be a good partner and actually get things done on time if they haven’t done their homework? Elan Lee: Precisely. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: And the other half is you haven’t done your homework. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: You actually don’t know, you actually don’t know how to use the silverware. When we walk into a meeting, the agent has done a year’s worth of work prepping for that meeting. They have made sure the buyers know what you’re going to pitch, how many games you’re going to pitch, what the order of the games is. They’ve made sure that the sales for the previous purchases they’ve made going into the meeting so they already have the confidence in, yes, these people are going to deliver. They’ve made sure that inventory levels are where they need to be so that a meeting doesn’t get sidetracked by them saying “This game is sold out, how did you let that happen?” So many things can go wrong that the agent is fixing before they go wrong so that the meeting stays on the rails and gets you to success. Tim Ferriss: Okay, got it. Elan Lee: It’s a full-time job and, without it — Tim Ferriss: And so that agent is the person who lobbies for the appointment after breakfast for lunch? Elan Lee: Exactly, yes. But you have to know to ask for it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, right. Elan Lee: Because your agent has other clients. They’re going to sit through maybe three, sometimes four meetings in that sell cycle and they’re going to give that prime slot to the one who asks for it. So you’ve got to know to ask for it. Here I am telling you on this podcast, it’s probably going to make my job a little bit harder for the next sales round, but so be it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. People listening need to hop through a few hoops before — Elan Lee: Yeah, fair enough, all right. Tim Ferriss: — they end up being viable competition. Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right. There’s a few other tricks that — Tim Ferriss: And we are going to come back to, if you’re just developing a game at your kitchen table, what are some of the first steps. So, we’re going to get to that. Elan Lee: Yeah, we’ll get there. Yeah, for sure. Tim Ferriss: But in the meantime, you said a couple of tricks of the trade? Elan Lee: Yeah, there’s a few more. I should be a little careful about what I say but, look — Tim Ferriss: We can always bleep things in edit later. Elan Lee: All right. So, you want to pay attention to, believe it or not, all of the retailers have color themes year by year. So you want to make sure that, when you walk into a meeting, your boxes match that color scheme, it makes it much easier for them to say yes. Tim Ferriss: Had no idea. Elan Lee: Yeah, right, I know. Because why would you? Because why would anybody, right? There’s things like those agents are given permission to read the notes from the all-hands meeting from the company so they know what the company’s priorities are. And so you want to sit down with your agent in advance and say, “Those buyers, what are they going to get promotions and raises based on this year? Is it more throughput at the store? Is it promote online sales? Is it match the color scheme?” Whatever it is, you want to make sure — Tim Ferriss: What are the incentives? Elan Lee: Yeah. And you want to make sure that, when they look at your games, they think, “Oh, I’m really trying to promote online sales this year, whoa, this game would do great on our website. And then the next game, this game would do great on our website as well.” And by the time you get to the end of the meeting they’re like, “Oh, my God, I can get a promotion if I just buy all 10 of these games.” That’s what you want them to walk away with. Tim Ferriss: All right. So, these meetings are huge, we’ve established this. A huge deal. Elan Lee: So important. Tim Ferriss: You mentioned a couple of tricks to the trade. And any other tips, tricks, learnings along the way? Elan Lee: So what happens after those meetings is also very important. Okay. So there’s two things we have to talk about. One is pricing structure and the other is marketing. Tim Ferriss: Yep. Elan Lee: So in the meeting you talk a little bit about both. You have to now include marketing. Remember I said three years ago things were different than today? Three years ago, the marketing plan that you show for your game is largely your own website. Maybe you’ve bought some TV commercials, things like billboards, product placement here and there, things like that. Today, none of that matters. All they care about is social media because that’s the only form of marketing for games that works anymore, so. Tim Ferriss: I should say also it particularly works on, and this is my understanding, on platforms like TikTok or now that other platforms have realized to avoid TikTok consuming their market share, they need to push and reward short-form video. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: Short-form video. Casual games are perfectly suited to short-form video. Elan Lee: Yeah. And the way that you build the most effective videos for those is you need to inspire, I think, two emotions. One, “I understand what those people are experiencing right now,” And two, “I would like to experience that.” And it took me forever to get to those two sentences. At first it was, “Let’s show gameplay, let’s show setup, let’s show a memorable moment. Let’s show people screaming and yelling because they’re having so much fun.” None of that matters. None of that works. “That looks like fun. I could have that much fun.” That’s it. That’s what you’re trying to show. Tim Ferriss: How does that differ from the first? Elan Lee: Um, it’s very, very focused, you want to — remember we talked about mastery early on? Tim Ferriss: Well, I also asked you guys, because we were talking about this very early on in the process, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Also, because if I’m procrastinating doing something hard, I like to talk about the marketing because it just is a lot easier for me to talk about. But I wanted to see examples of videos that had worked for any of your games. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Social posts. And so they were sent over. I was like, “Okay, I think I can deduce why this works.” Often it was one person playing the other person struggling to guess what the other person was doing and one person losing it laughing. Just inconsolably, but in the best possible way, losing it, getting the giggles out of control. Elan Lee: Okay. So I’ll tell you, one of the most effective pieces of media we have ever used was for Poetry for Neanderthals. This has like at this point, I don’t know, tens of millions of views. And all it is — oh, sorry, “Here’s how you play Poetry for Neanderthals. I have to get you, I have a secret word on this card. I have to get you to say that word. And I can only speak using single syllable words. That’s the whole game. If I mess up, someone sitting next to me has a giant inflatable neanderthal club and they get to bonk me on the head.” All right. So there’s our whole game. The best video we’ve ever seen is someone who’s trying to get a person to say the word “garage.” And we know they’re trying to get the person to say the word garage because we put that right on the screen. We show you, “Here’s the secret word, it’s garage.” And they’re just saying, “Car, go here. Car, hole, car hole. This car hole, big car hole.” And everyone’s losing it. And the poor person trying to guess is like, “What the fuck is a car hole? Glove compartment? What are you trying to say?” And then they say, “Vehicle. Multiple syllable word.” And so they get bonked on the head. Okay, here’s why that video is so effective. It’s those two senses. One is, “I see the experience they’re having. I get that.” And the secondary corollary is “I could do better than that.” Tim Ferriss: Is this the video, I think I remember seeing this. This might have been a separate video, but there’s a woman who’s the poet and then there’s the guy next to her, holding the club. Elan Lee: Yeah, so menacing. Tim Ferriss: The ax is going to drop. Yeah. And everyone’s losing it, including the guy at the back. Elan Lee: Because you look at that and you say, “I understand the rules,” immediately. “I understand the experience they’re having. I would like to have that experience.” And that’s what makes for an effective social media video. Tim Ferriss: All right, so how do you pitch that? Elan Lee: Well, we show a lot of examples and we show a track record. We say, “Look, here’s how many views our last round of videos got. Here’s how many likes, here’s how many shares, here’s how many subscriptions.” All this stuff, we show them right there in the meeting. We never had to do that. This is a brand new phenomenon. And we say, “Here’s the type of video that we’re going to craft for this new game,” and we always couch it in those two sentences. “Here’s how we’re going to explain the fun people are having and here’s how we’re going to make the audience feel like they would like to have that much fun as well.” And that’s been very effective for us. So that’s now half the meeting, because every game we start by, I demo the game. Tim Ferriss: It’s social media strategy. Elan Lee: Yes. I demo the game, I pull the game back, we talk a little bit about the pricing structure and the theme and the box and all that. And then we go right into social media strategy for that game. Because I have to spend as much time on that as I did on the game design because they’re equally important now. It’s huge. Such a difference. Tim Ferriss: All right, so for somebody listening who is thinking about making a game, and I really encourage everyone to do that, and I’m just going to flash, this is as good a time as any, just to flash these blank cards that are within every Coyote box and they are color-coded. You can use these to make action cards, which are these different gestures and actions and so on. Elan Lee: Yeah. Those are the templates that we use. Tim Ferriss: These are the templates. You can use them to make Coyote cards, these modifiers. You can use them to make the attack cards which you use to sabotage other people. There are other ways to play those cards. This is intended to invite everyone to basically create their own game by modifying the rules. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: Or adding new elements that are uniquely their own. You can have fun with your friends, you can have fun with your kids. I mean, this is intended to make you a part of the creative process, which you will be part of anyway, just by the way you play the game but this takes it to another level. And this was a really important element for me. So this will be a warm-up in a sense. You get to try game design, game development light, with these blank cards. But let’s say somebody then decides they want to give it a go, maybe it’s with one of their kids, like you did with your daughter. Maybe it’s by themselves. Who knows? Maybe it’s going to the game shop, local game shop, which I really recommend people do. If you’ve never been to a real proper game shop, go in on a game night when people are set up and also check out the games you might not be inclined to check out. So if you’re a casual gamer, go to a Warhammer night, see what that’s about. Elan Lee: Totally. Tim Ferriss: Check out these different worlds. Elan Lee: Another secret weapon is go to a game shop, find the owner, or even the person behind the counter, someone who knows what they’re talking about. And just say, “I’m looking for a game. What game do you wish more people would give a try?” And you’ll find the gems that way because they know. But maybe the game doesn’t have the best box or the best name or it fell short somewhere and people just aren’t buying it, but they know it’s amazing. That’s where you find them. It’s a great experience. Tim Ferriss: So start testing the waters in that way. It’s so easy to do in a place like Austin. I mean, this is Austin. People might think of game locations and X, Y, Z, they’re all over the place. There happens to be a really vibrant scene here. And if you wanted to, if one wanted to start developing their own game, let’s say they find something that starts to stick. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. We’ve got a tiger by the tail. This seems to be working. They’re play testing. It might take a while, like Settlers of Catan, I think Klaus Teuber had 150 versions before, that’s a complex game. But let’s say they start to develop the game and they’re like, “All right, I would like to try to sell this.” What are the options? What would you say to someone who’s like, they’re smart, they can plan, they’ve operated in the world before, so they’re not new to adulting, but they have no experience in selling games. Elan Lee: There are three paths. I’ll tell you all three paths and then I’ll tell you my favorite one. Tim Ferriss: All right. Elan Lee: Okay. Path number one, self-publishing. Self-publishing is hard, but you can print out your own decks. You can design everything yourself. You can write the rules yourself. You can do absolutely everything yourself. And then you can spend a few thousand dollars, publish a few hundred copies, and send them out to all your friends. Okay. So that’s option one. It sucks. Don’t do that one. It’s just the worst. I mean, you’re just going to make every mistake and you’re not — Tim Ferriss: And you’re going to have to pay for your mistakes. Elan Lee: And you pay for every mistake, and then once you make the mistake, now you can’t take it back and you can’t undo it. Just don’t self-publish. It’s a terrible idea. Okay, there’s number one. That’s not my favorite one. Number two is you go to an existing publisher, Hasbro, Mattel, nowadays Exploding Kittens. You can approach big publishers, pitch your game, and then strike a deal with them where they will handle all the risk, but they will also take most of the reward. You can still honestly get very rich this way, but you have to get into their portfolio, so either you need a track record or you just have to absolutely wow them or you need some other — you have to show up with some bona fides. You can’t just say, “I’m a brand new designer, here’s my brand new game, please publish me.” Tim Ferriss: How would you, maybe there are exceptions where people have wowed them, first time game designer with a game, how does one do that? Elan Lee: You go to a convention. Tim Ferriss: You go to a convention? Elan Lee: Yeah, you go to a convention, you demo your game, they will all show up. They’re like agents recruiting for a sports team. They’re going to show up to all of those places and they’re going to walk the halls and they’re going to check even the smallest booths. And they’re going to even go to the big convention halls where everyone just has their own little folding table or even a temporary folding table. They’re going to look at all of that stuff. So it is possible to do it that way, but you have to keep in mind they have very few slots open and they usually only have one or two agents, scouts looking for games. So your chances of success there are low as a first-time person, much better if you can walk in, if you can schedule a meeting and they will take that meeting and then you can say, “Here’s why you should not say no to this.” Tim Ferriss: What are the things you can do or put in a pitch that increase the likelihood of getting a meeting, outside of being an influencer with 20 million followers on Instagram? Elan Lee: Well, yeah, that helps, but the reason that helps is, what I was going to say is the ability to sell the game, whatever it is, maybe you’re an influencer — Tim Ferriss: By the way, also true of nonfiction writing. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: If you’re selling a book. Elan Lee: And for selling a screenplay and for really selling anything, you need to be able to say, “Here’s why people are going to take notice of this thing and why you would be a fool to pass on this opportunity.” That’s hard. Oftentimes the best way to do that is to have already done it, which means your first time out, you need what I’m about to talk about, which is option three. Option three, crowdfunding. This is relatively new, like 10, 15 years old. Tim Ferriss: So it is, I guess, self-publishing in a sense, but you’re getting other people to fund the development. Elan Lee: Two things, yes to that. Exactly right. Other people are funding a hundred percent of the development, which is incredible. But also you are collecting those funds on a platform that promotes the game. People are there watching your video, you’re trying to convince them. Tim Ferriss: It is a discovery platform. Elan Lee: Exactly. Perfectly phrased. It is a discovery platform that was missing 15 years ago. “Watch my self-published YouTube video and hopefully fund my game,” it just didn’t exist. So now people are looking at crowdfunding sites looking for cool new experiences and backing them. And that’s a new invention and that’s really cool. And it’s not my favorite one either. So I just said I picked my favorite and I just pitched three and I said, “None of them are my favorite.” Here’s my actual favorite. A combination of two and three. Start on crowdfunding, especially if it’s your first time out. Learn everything you can. Your first project is probably going to fail. That’s okay. You’ve got nothing at stake. You didn’t lose anything. Fix it. Relaunch it, fix it again. Relaunch it again. Take as many times as you need. There’s nothing at risk here. You’re just learning the process. Awesome. When you get a success on whatever crowdfunding platform you love, now go to those publishers and say, “Here are my bona fides. Here’s proof that this thing is going to sell. I’ve already sold this once. I’ve already gotten 10.” Tim Ferriss: Do you do that before you have shipped the game? Elan Lee: No. Very important. No. Ship the game first. If the only thing you can prove is that you are a train wreck waiting to happen, you will get nothing from them. So ship the game, show that you’re organized, even if it’s a small fulfillment like you sell a hundred copies of your game, show that you can fulfill those hundred copies and then start to show the reactions to those. If you’ve only got a hundred people who bought the game, reach out to every single one of them and beg them to record a video about how much they love your game. And now go to publishers with that. That’s really what you’re searching for. Use crowdfunding as exactly what it is, as a way to launch your new game to then take to step two. Tim Ferriss: Let me ask this. There may be people listening or watching who think to themselves, “That sounds awesome, but wasn’t the heyday of crowdfunding three, four, or five years ago?” Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: You hear less about it. Certainly for, let’s say, selling to a hundred people or maybe many, many more, I’m sure there are runaway success campaigns even today, but are there any tweaks that you would add to it? Elan Lee: It’s really tricky. Okay, so here’s what happened with crowdfunding. So we launched on Kickstarter, Exploding Kittens launched on Kickstarter, and by some amazing twist of fate, that was perfect timing. Very few people had heard of Kickstarter. They heard about this funny, silly thing. It was drawn by The Oatmeal. Matt already had this incredibly large audience and people showed up and they said, “Ooh, crowdfunding. Ooh, this thing costs 20 bucks. I’m going to back this thing.” And we had 219,000 people try that thing. Amazing. Unheard of success. Those people then over the next, let’s call it five years, stayed on Kickstarter and they backed other things, other games, other projects, whatever. And what they found was the nature of Kickstarter is such that only about 50 percent of those projects that shipped either the thing that shipped was nowhere close to the thing promised, or the thing never shipped, and they never got their money back. Whatever it is. Tim Ferriss: People got burned. Elan Lee: They got burned, and they had a terrible experience. And now when you say, “Hey, back my Kickstarter,” everyone’s got this memory implanted of, “Oh, that was a bad experience for me. Maybe I even had some great experiences, but I also had those bad ones and this is not worth it. And I’m not going back to that site or any crowdfunding site.” So that’s the problem. We’re not seeing the numbers we used to see because everyone’s walking in with this baggage and it sucks. My only advice is there is now a secondary ecosystem around Kickstarter, other websites that have gotten very good at promoting projects, that have gotten very good at advertising new offerings on Kickstarter and building trust, like if you get on this other — Tim Ferriss: So it’s like a curated site that vets projects. Elan Lee: Exactly right. And here’s the thing, those companies almost always take a percentage of what the maker gets in exchange for helping them with fulfillment, with creation, with everything. So not only are you buying into a trusted ecosystem, but you also know there’s multiple parties involved that are going to work very hard to make sure you get that product. Tim Ferriss: What are some of those companies? Elan Lee: I would have to look them up. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Yeah, no problem. All right, we’ll put maybe links to a few of them in the show notes. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. There’s a ton of them. They all have the word backer in them somewhere, backer found and backer this and backer that. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. We’ll put a couple of links in the show notes. Tim.blog/podcast, you can find it. And I will also just give a shout-out to a friend of mine who at some point you have to meet, maybe you’ve met him already. Craig Mod, does that name ring at all? Elan Lee: No. I don’t know Craig. Tim Ferriss: All right, so Craig is a gem of a human, amazing writer, also very technical as a software engineer, software development expert. And he, at one point, for his beautiful books that he has bound and crafted in Japan, these are works of art, they’re absolutely beautiful. And he created basically a, I don’t know if open source is the right term, but he does have the code available on GitHub for anybody who wants it, called, I think it’s called Craigstarter, which is effectively, if you want to host your own crowdfunding campaign and in his opinion, fix some of the bugs that were difficult to contend with. Elan Lee: Interesting. Tim Ferriss: Then boom, you can do that. Elan Lee: Oh, I love that. Tim Ferriss: And I think he incorporated Shopify and other add-ons, different services could be as modules. I’m sure I’m not using the right terminology, but incorporated into it. Elan Lee: Super clever. I love it. Tim Ferriss: So people can also check that out. And I have two interviews with Craig. You should check out both of them. They’re absolutely fantastic. Elan Lee: Lovely. Tim Ferriss: Okay, so folks can look at these services as basically a stamp of credibility. They will help not only with the promotion if you are so vetted, but with the fulfillment, like that third-party logistics. Elan Lee: That’s right. Now, I don’t think we’re going to see a crowdfunding campaign on the scale of Exploding Kittens these days. There are a few exceptions. You just interviewed one of them, in fact. Tim Ferriss: Brandon Sanderson? Elan Lee: Exactly, out of control success. Tim Ferriss: $45 million, or whatever it was, Kickstarter campaign for fantasy books. Unheard of. Elan Lee: Bonkers. Unheard of. But what I love is that that shows this is not even a remotely dead platform. Tim Ferriss: No. Elan Lee: There is success to be had here. You just have to be creative. I mean he started out with a great fan base. He picked an incredible title, the first word of his campaign was, “Surprise.” No one’s done that before. What does that mean? And just everything about it. Smart on top of smart on top of smart. I loved it. Loved it. So it’s very possible, but it’s also very rare and you have to be smart about it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Well, here’s the thing. It’s possible and who cares? It may not have the gravitational pull that it had five years ago, but if you can’t sell anything in a crowdfunding campaign, you are not going to sell any buyer at mass retail. Elan Lee: Absolutely right. Tim Ferriss: It’s not going to happen. Elan Lee: Absolutely right. Tim Ferriss: And therefore you save yourself years of banging your head against a brick wall when you’re never going to break through. If you get, and this might not sound like good news, but if it’s going to fail, you want to fail as quickly as possible. Elan Lee: It’s great news, as long as you don’t take it personally, as long as you say “This product — “ Tim Ferriss: How many games do you guys screw around with on any level? And how many make the cut? Elan Lee: We probably work on a hundred games a year and less than 20 make the cut. Tim Ferriss: And that’s with all of your experience? Elan Lee: Yeah. That’s probably way higher than it should be. I’m probably pushing forward games that have no right to be pushed forward. But again, you don’t take it personally. You say, “This game is flawed.” And the faster you can figure that out, the faster you can move on to a game that isn’t flawed. Tim Ferriss: So if I heard you correctly then, it’s crowdfunding. You establish some numbers and so on that you can share that show traction at some type, game reactions, et cetera. Then you take all of that to book a meeting at a trade show or a conference or convention with one of these publishers who already has the annual meetings and line reviews. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: And you make a pitch to do a deal with them. Elan Lee: That’s my favorite path through this. Tim Ferriss: What deal terms do you need to pay attention to? Elan Lee: Okay, so there is one very important number that you’re going to get, and it’s going to seem like a very low number, but here’s how this works. Most publishers are going to throw a number at you, like two percent. Tim Ferriss: Royalty rate? Elan Lee: Yeah. And you’re going to think, “Wait a second, I was the inventor, I get 80 percent and you’re offering me two percent?” But here’s what that number actually means. They, the publisher, are going to take on all the risk. They’re going to do all the printing, they’re going to do all the relationship management, they’re going to do that sales meeting, they’re supporting hundreds of people on their staff, they’re doing all this stuff that you are not doing. But in exchange for that, that two percent isn’t two percent of the profit, it’s two percent of the revenue. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Top line. Elan Lee: Exactly. And that is a very important distinction. That makes that two percent probably closer to 20 percent, 30 percent once you do all the math. Tim Ferriss: It’s the opposite of Hollywood accounting. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: It’s not some percentage of net income, which is defined in some Byzantine way to fuck you every which way from Sunday. Elan Lee: Precisely right. Tim Ferriss: If it’s top line — Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So just to reiterate what you just said, two percent is more like 20 plus percent? Elan Lee: Yes, that’s exactly right. Tim Ferriss: Of profit? Elan Lee: Yeah. And you can ask them to break down that math for you. You can say, “Show me the spreadsheet, show me what you’re spending, what your responsibilities are, what mine are. After all of those numbers are crunched, what is the total amount you’re going to spend on this game? Show me your total projections on what’s coming in, show me how much I’m going to make of that.” And then you can start comparing those numbers yourself and see, “Oh, of the money that came in, I’m getting 20 percent of it. Even though this number only says two percent.” Once you crunch that math, this is a pretty decent deal. And you can get higher than two percent. Usually not as a first-time developer, but I’ve seen deals anywhere from two to 12 percent on the super high end. Tim Ferriss: 12, wow. Elan Lee: You’ve got to be a rockstar because at 12 percent, now you’re at 50 percent, and that’s tough to get to. You’ve got to really pull your weight to get numbers like that. So those are what the deals look like. And then after that, then the whole relationship moves into this like, “Okay, now what the hell are we actually making? What is the quality of the cards? What are the components in the box? Are you allowed to change rules?” Tim Ferriss: Quick question, is the deal structure similar to a book publishing contract in the sense that the game developer would get an advance against sales? Or is that — Elan Lee: Sometimes. Tim Ferriss: Sometimes? Elan Lee: Yeah. You can negotiate that. I’ve seen publishers do that or not do that. I will just say for Exploding Kittens, we never do advances. Tim Ferriss: It’s fundamentally different also from, say, nonfiction book publishing in the following sense. If you’re taking a, let’s call it conventional publishing approach, which is very similar to selling the game, it’s like you have an agent. You’ve got the editors, let’s just say, and the publishers who are the buyers of sorts, the editor might be the category buyer but they have to get the okay from the publisher for signing off on deals. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: And you’ll have your royalty rate, which varies widely, but let’s just say somewhere depending on paperback versus hardcover, up to probably a maximum in conventional deals of 12 to 15 percent of cover, which is also, again, of cover. And then there’s the advance, but the critical difference that I was alluding to is typically when a nonfiction book is sold, you are selling a book proposal, which is a writing sample and a marketing plan. Elan Lee: Wow. Tim Ferriss: And if, and only if, a publisher decides to sign a contract and buy the book, do you get an advance to buy you the time so you can stop doing all of these other things to write the full book, whereas with the game, the game’s got to be ready. Elan Lee: It’s done. Yeah. Now let’s call it 90 percent done, to be fair. And usually when we take on games, we change them significantly just because there’s always a better version, and through testing, we discover it. But the reason we don’t do advances, partially, is exactly what you’re saying. You’re already done. We’re not trying to pull you off of other projects. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You don’t have to stop your nine to five. Elan Lee: Exactly. Exactly. But the other reason is because I want a partnership. I’m not here to say, “You sold us this game. Now we’re never going to talk again.” I want you here every day. I want skin in the game. We’re going to all make this better together, which is why we do so few partnerships. Tim Ferriss: Now, when you do partnerships, meaning you’re the publisher, you’re paying someone a royalty, how do you typically find those? So for instance, and I imagine a lot of it is you guys canvassing and basically asking the question that you recommended people ask the store owners, “Which game do you wish people played more often?” And then you find something that has the bones of a really good game but a piece of it is shitting the bed. There’s something that is broken and you’re like, “Oh, we can fix that broken thing.” Or do you take cold submissions? How does that work? Elan Lee: We have a form. We have a submission form on our website. We almost never find anything there. It’s hard. It’s time-consuming to go through all of them and honestly, it’s just not the highest quality. We also go to conventions. We look a little bit around there. Sometimes we find a diamond in the rough. Tim Ferriss: That’s a crowded fishing hole, right? Elan Lee: Very crowded. The most effective way are those agents. We talk to those two agents and we say, “Hey, people approach you all the time wanting you to be their agent and you have to turn a lot of them down. The ones that you feel terrible about because they’re such a good game and they just can’t get in the door, send them to us.” And that works really well. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Smart. That’s super smart. Aside from a crowdfunding campaign, what would actually cut through in a submission? Are there any ingredients outside of, here are a bunch of compelling data from a crowdfunding campaign? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Or, “Hey, I’ve designed a hundred hit games.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. There’s that. Tim Ferriss: Aside from those two, what other types of lines or elements would cut through the noise? Elan Lee: So remember I said that phrase, the way we design games is we don’t make games that are entertaining, we make games that make the players entertaining. 90 percent of the game pitches I see are attempts to be entertaining games and I just immediately dismiss them. That looks like that game is working so hard to entertain the players. I don’t care. The best games, the ones that I pay very careful attention to, are when everything you do in the game creates an interaction between two players. I’m not interested in a four-player game where all four players are playing solitaire. It’s just, who cares? I’m interested in a game where the players are playing the players and I play a card — Tim Ferriss: We tweaked a lot in Coyote based on that. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: So guiding principle. Elan Lee: And those are the best games. Those are the ones I love the most. Those are the ones I want to play over and over again. Tim Ferriss: And it could be as simple as you might, I’m saying you, the listener or viewer might remember holding your cards facing you versus having the cards available to the entire table. Elan Lee: That’s right. Because now we’re playing all together. And the card I choose, if I have a blind hand, if I have a deck of cards and I choose a card and then I play it, that is me presenting a game to the players. If I have all my available cards face up on the table and everyone can see what I choose, and everyone’s hoping I pick that first card, and I hover my hand over it and then I move to the second card instead and everyone starts groaning and then I play that second card anyway, now it’s me playing the players. And those are the best games in the world. Tim Ferriss: What are some common Achilles heels for games that have the potential to be great and huge successes? And I’m not going to mention names, but we’ve talked about a couple of games that you’ve considered buying or publishing, and I’m wondering what are some of the common weaknesses where you’re, this is a great game, but the reason it didn’t work is X or Y or Z. Elan Lee: All right, so there’s two basic places the games fall apart. One is right off the bat, their boxes suck, or the name sucks. The number of games out there called The Legendary Folklore of Gorgonzel. I can’t remember them, I don’t know what they are. I look at this — Tim Ferriss: Got to throw a CØCKPUNCH in there, and then it’s problem solved. Elan Lee: CØCKPUNCH aside, I would argue that those games, they have no chance of success. Yes, they’re going to sell 10 copies to the 10 people that bought The Legendary Tales of Gorgonzel volumes one through six, and they’re going to buy volume seven. Cool, great. I don’t care. Picking the wrong name, picking a non-descriptive name, putting a picture on the box that does not describe gameplay at all and does not provide a compelling narrative about what experience you are about to have, those games have zero chance of success. And I see that over and over and over again. You can fail right up front. And I’ve even seen the biggest publishers in the world mess this up, especially now that game shelves are so crowded and you don’t have five games to choose from, you have 500 games to choose from. And a game that doesn’t do a good job of saying, “Pick me, pick me, pick me,” you’re just not going to pick, so you will fail right there. Tim Ferriss: Or really complicated packaging too. I’ve seen that a bunch. Elan Lee: Absolutely. Tim Ferriss: Where there’s just so much going on. There’s no one dominant element. It’s like, what am I supposed to look at here? Elan Lee: Yeah, what do you look at first? Tim Ferriss: So you can’t. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: You don’t look at anything, you look at the next box. Elan Lee: It’s just noise. Just noise. We worked very hard on Coyote, on all our games, but I remember having this discussion about Coyote because this is such an important lesson. When you look at this box, we know the first thing you’re going to look at and we know the second thing you’re going to look at and we know the third thing you’re going to look at, and this is a formula, and we crafted this — Tim Ferriss: It’s a formula. Elan Lee: — very carefully. Tim Ferriss: By the way, also exactly what works in old school print advertising. Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Right? Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Header image, headline, subheading. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: Text. Elan Lee: Yeah. And those components are all present here. Tim Ferriss: And if you fuck up the order, pardon my French, the eye doesn’t know how to track or it bounces around. Elan Lee: And if there’s other better options right next door, off you go. We hit those three things on a box meticulously, and your reaction should not be, “I’m going to buy that game.” That’s not our goal. Your reaction is, “I’m going to pick up this game and I’m going to turn it over and I’m going to read the back of the box.” And now we’ve got a very different task. Now we have more real estate we can afford. We still know the first thing you’re going to look at, but now we care a little bit less about the second thing. As long as you’ve already got enough interest, you’ve already committed to picking this thing up, now you’re willing to read a little story. As long as you can see the end of that story and you know it’s not too long, you’re going to read a little story. The goal of this is now purchase. I want you to get to the end of this experience and say, “I’ve got to have it. I want this.” Tim Ferriss: And just for people who can’t see this particular visual, and there’s all sorts of stuff on the back of the card, which we won’t get into, but some people might notice interesting things on the back of the cards. The dominant element on the back of the box is how to play. And man, we worked on this a lot too, with basically three panes, step one, step two, step three. “Put cards on the table, then take turns performing them,” that’s step one. And you’ve got a little visual with the salamander action cards. Then next part is “Play cards to help or sabotage other players,” shows two examples. Elan Lee: “Sabotage” was a very carefully chosen word, by the way. Tim Ferriss: Very carefully chosen. And then the last one is “Mess up and you’re out. The last player standing wins.” That’s for competitive mode. Now, one aspect of this that I think is very clever is not sure if you should buy this game? Give us a few seconds to convince you. And then there’s a QR code. Elan Lee: Nobody does that. This is new. Tim Ferriss: I know. What’s the impetus behind this? Elan Lee: This was an idea I had that we’re demoing on this game, first time ever. My idea was “If I went to the store with you, I could convince you to buy my favorite game because I’m going to pitch the hell out of that game.” But I’m not in the store with you, so that’s a problem. My first idea was for every retail location in the world, “Will they let us install a telephone that you can pick up and talk to somebody?” And they said, “No.” My second idea was, “Can I hire a person to stand in every store and convince you to buy the game I want you to buy?” And they said, “Sort of, but you have to pay for all of that.” And I was like, “Oh, that’s not going to work.” And so this was option three. Tim Ferriss: It’s cool, it’s a lot of people. 6,000 plus people. Elan Lee: I know, right? Can you imagine? This is just a little QR code. And the idea is I can’t stand next to you for every store, but I can tell you what I would’ve said had I been standing there. And so you scan this code and it’s just a 15-second video. In this case, it’s me, Tim, saying, “Listen, you’re holding a game in your hands. It’s the greatest thing you’ll ever see. Let me try to convince you.” And it’s just a pitch. It’s just, if I were standing next to you in the store, here’s why you should buy this game. And I don’t think a lot of people are going to scan that code, to be fair. But for those who do, they’re going to have the experience of a friend telling them, “You should trust me. This is going to be great, trust me.” Tim Ferriss: And it doesn’t take up that much real estate either. It’s an easy addition to the box. Once again, test it. Right. Let’s test it. Elan Lee: Test it. And what’s the worst that can happen? Tim Ferriss: See what happens. And I also want to revisit something you mentioned earlier, which is that royalty rate, whether it’s two percent, it’s up to 12 percent in the book world. Let me take the book world and the publishing world in the book publishing sense is changing a lot, but it’s also quite consistent over time. Different things have changed, sure, audio as a format has grown tremendously and become highly prized now versus 10 years ago when I could carve out those rights, it’s a lot harder to do now if you’re going to do the conventional route. But some folks will look at the percentages and they’ll say, “Well, wait a second, max 15 percent after an escalator, I’m starting off at 12 percent for hardcover. That’s ridiculous. I wrote the whole thing, da, da, da, da, da. I want to make the lion’s share.” There are some instances where you can make that work, but I will say just a few things. When you begin, for most people, unless you are excellent at running a meticulously managed business, it’s actually pretty tough to beat those numbers. In part because you’re going to be sacrificing distribution, so the top of the funnel number is going to be different. Secondly, when you factor in paying various agents, various distributors, and all of these little costs that for you, without any scale of having a thousand skews in a department dedicated to it, you start to very quickly approach that number. Elan Lee: Very quickly. Tim Ferriss: And by the way, you’re running a real business. This is not the easiest thing in the world to do at all. And I will probably do some experiments on that side of the equation in terms of “self-publishing,” which I would put in quotation marks because it’s going to be augmented pseudo self-publishing on a few levels. But I would only have the confidence of doing that myself currently, because I’ve gone through the conventional route multiple times and I’ve also run quite a few businesses. But if you’ve never, what Stephen Key, I mentioned earlier, one simple idea for licensing, what he might call venturing, running a business, do not underestimate the value of your time and sanity also. Elan Lee: It’s so true. Tim Ferriss: Because he’s, “Hey, look, I’ll take the licensing deal, maybe I’ll negotiate the number up a little bit.” But he’s like, “I can do 12 of those a year.” Elan Lee: That’s right. That’s exactly it. Tim Ferriss: And it adds up to a lot. And I have no employees, no supply chain issues. Elan Lee: No risk. Tim Ferriss: No, “Oops, that was printed the wrong way and now I have thousands of books —” Elan Lee: You have to recall those. Oh, my God. Tim Ferriss: “— that are sitting in my garage unsold, gathering dust and mold.” Elan Lee: Let me tell you the simplest example of the difference between doing it yourself and getting help, valuing your time. Our very first game Exploding Kittens, I needed to put a barcode on the box because it has to sell in retail. I go, I’m like, I’m going to research this, this can’t be too hard. I do the research and I find this website and it’s, you’ve got to pay some little subscription, 100 bucks a year, whatever it is, and you can generate unlimited barcodes. Amazing. I generate a barcode, I put it on the box. That wasn’t so hard. Then Target’s like, “Well, this is the wrong format.” I’m like, “Okay.” I spend another 100 bucks, I get a different format bar, put it on. They’re like, “We need a different barcode based on the palette that it’s in.” And then I talk to Walmart and they’re like, “Yeah, we use a different barcode format and we need this barcode to represent whether it was picked up in China or Mexico or Poland, so you actually need three different ones. Oh, and by the way, if it’s bundled with other games, we need a fourth one. And by the way, if it ships into Arkansas, we need a fifth.” And I was just like, “Help. Oh, my God, help.” And that’s the difference. You should not get good at this. Why would you want to get good at that? Tim Ferriss: What’s funny is I was actually going to bring up the example of the UPC codes and the ISBN and all this stuff because I also went down that rabbit hole. I’m like, “How hard could it be?” Elan Lee: Right, right. Tim Ferriss: “Oh, this is easy.” And lo and behold, actually it’s a lot of brain damage. I’m not saying that no one should Venture in the sense of self-funding or self-publishing, but it is a lot harder and much more consuming than most people realize. Elan Lee: And there’s no reason, unless you want to do it for a living, there’s no reason to get good at it. There’s no upside there. Tim Ferriss: And do it for a living meaning handle those types of details. Elan Lee: Right, exactly. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Elan Lee: Anyway, we have a barcode person who does it for a living. She’s quite good. I’m so happy she’s on my team. Tim Ferriss: All right, so on the side of selling games, what else have we not touched on? Any other aspects? Elan Lee: Let’s see. Another thing I learned along the way is there’s two kinds of selling. One is everything we’ve been talking about today. And your expectation is, “I have sold you a game, the game is now your responsibility. And we’ve negotiated a price, you, the retailer, own this game now and you’re going to sell it.” The second kind is the kind that we actually engage in, which is you do own this game, but there are restrictions on how you can sell it. Tim Ferriss: Can you explain that again? When you say you own this game, you mean a retailer? Elan Lee: You, the retailer, have purchased this palette of games from me. Tim Ferriss: I get it. All right. Sorry, I was just clarifying because people might’ve heard that as you own the IP of the game. Elan Lee: Sorry, sorry, sorry. Yes. Tim Ferriss: You are buying an inventory of this game. Elan Lee: Correct. Now, what if the game doesn’t sell very well? Whose problem is that? Well, if you didn’t think that through and it’s just a straight sale, they can put it in a bargain bin or they can sell it to somebody else who’s then going to sell it. Or if you really didn’t negotiate it, they can force you to buy it back from them. The restrictions on what happens to the game, what they’re allowed to do post-sale is so meticulous and these contracts get so long. And this is another thing, you don’t want to get good at this. You just need to hire someone who has seen every imaginable mistake and knows what to argue for. And oftentimes the retailers don’t care that much about this part, especially because they have a lot of faith. This thing’s going to do well. But when it goes poorly, if it goes poorly, and we’ve had a few examples of this, what do you do next? In the case of something as simple as Amazon, Amazon has a terrible policy for returns. Namely, they will accept all returns and it is the vendor’s responsibility, my responsibility. You buy Exploding Kittens from GameKnight, you play the game, you damage all the cards because you spilled beer all over them, you put them back in the box the next day after you had a great time and you return it and now that’s my cost. And that happens hundreds of times a week. It sucks. There’s also this thing where people will buy counterfeit games and they’ll buy, then, the real version. They’ll buy a counterfeit for a dollar, they’ll buy the real version on Amazon, they’ll keep the real version, they’ll return the counterfeit and now that’s mine as well. And I just spent $20 on that stupid counterfeit version because that’s coming back to me. All of this stuff has to be thought through in advance and it’s tricky, because some retailers, the Targets and the Walmarts in the world, they are so willing to work with you on that stuff. Amazon, not so much. They’re just like, “Oh, you don’t like our policy? All right, well maybe a different platform is for you.” It’s hard. It’s really hard. Tim Ferriss: And I should say that I’ve run into, when I’ve talked about termination clauses or what do we do when everyone’s pissed off and things aren’t working? Because really that’s the only time that you’re going to go back and look at the agreement, which is why Gary Keller, famous for his real estate empire, said, “You should really call them disagreements.” The only time you’re going to look at them is when things are really going sideways. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: And there are some people I’ve spoken to about the importance of these things, like, “Wow, that’s really pessimistic.” I’m like, “No, no, no.” Let’s understand the consequences of not going through this. I know so many examples of entrepreneurs who actually had a chance at a runaway success and they did not pay attention to these terms for, say, a QVC or a huge retailer. And this could happen with Kickstarter as well, of course, they get overextended because now they have orders for God knows how much inventory that is well beyond their capacity, their experience, their financial means. And in their mind, let’s take out the Kickstarter or crowdfunding, but they don’t think about the return policy and they get the hug of death. They overextend themselves financially to produce the inventory, they ship it, and then any number of things can happen. It might be net 270 payment terms. Elan Lee: Oh, God. Tim Ferriss: It could be just — Elan Lee: So brutal. Tim Ferriss: — cash flow suicide right on the front end. And on top of that you might get all of it shipped back to you — Elan Lee: All of it. Tim Ferriss: — and it’s your problem. And then that — Elan Lee: It’s so tragic. Tim Ferriss: — is the hug of death and you’re done. Elan Lee: And then you’ve seen this, you’ve seen this picture. You have this friend whose apartment is filled with products and it’s taken over their living space and they have no way to move it. Tim Ferriss: I did that myself early on. I made an audiobook product. I was going to sell millions of this thing. Oh, my God. Didn’t do any market testing, none of that stuff, just high on my own supply. And I had an entire garage full of these things that just melted in the heat ultimately. And at the time though, that was a huge financial risk. I didn’t take so much risk that it torpedoed me, but if I had had that level of self-delusion and lack of experimentation a little later on, it very easily could have been a recipe for disaster. Elan Lee: Totally. Look, there’s so many ways to mess this up. There’s so many ways to mess this up. And the only good news is there is someone out there who has messed it up in every possible way. Tim Ferriss: Or represented people who have messed it up — Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: — in every possible way. Elan Lee: And those are the people you have to work with. You have to. If you don’t, the risk you’re taking on is just massive. Luckily, I had some very good advice early on from people who said, “Don’t take this on yourself. Just don’t do this.” And it’s the best advice I ever got. Tim Ferriss: And I think maybe tell me if this is overreaching on my part, but don’t take this on yourself now in the sense that after you’ve had 10 mega successes and you actually are fluent in retailese and you have the relationships, all right, now you can take some calculated risks. Elan Lee: And now you can hire the people that you would otherwise contract, now you can pull them in-house. Because now you can afford their salaries and now you want them to only be working on your own products. Great. That’s a huge mark of success and really that is exactly the way you reinvest in your own company. Tim Ferriss: And to reiterate just a few things, if you want to develop a game, number one, you can just develop it for your family, your friends, and keep it small. And I will just say in the book world, a lot of later mega successes have started out that way. You don’t have to go for scale, which I think can be a very dangerous word out of the gate. But as you mentioned, you can also, with the blank cards in Coyote, you can get a taste of it, see if you like it, then you can use the books that you recommended. And there are certainly other resources, we’ll put things in the show notes, to play around with prototyping. Look at these initial cards. These are blank cards with Sharpie writing on them. Elan Lee: That’s it. Tim Ferriss: That’s it. Elan Lee: That’s literally it. Tim Ferriss: That’s it, that’s the entire thing. And you can also find kits online, you can find them anywhere you want. Amazon has gaming kits where there are blank dice and cards and so on so you can workshop it. Elan Lee: Easy. It’s so easy. Tim Ferriss: It’s like Build-A-Bear for games basically. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: And what I would add to that is you don’t need to run a big business to be a successful game designer. Elan Lee: Absolutely. Tim Ferriss: In fact, I would imagine most of the legendary game designers are not running companies. Elan Lee: No, definitely not. Tim Ferriss: They’re designing games and licensing them. And man, there are some legends out there. Elan Lee: Legends. They’ve created incredible games and they’ve generated gigantic wealth for themselves because in success, that two percent deal, that five percent deal, whatever it is, that faucet doesn’t turn off, that’s in perpetuity. In summary, I don’t think the games business is going anywhere. Tim Ferriss: And also there is a lot of room to innovate. There still is room. There’s so many games, but I wouldn’t have even attempted to create a game had I not thought there was space. Elan Lee: The thing is, it’s like saying, is there still space in the book industry, in the movie industry? All a game is is an idea delivered in a new way. When are we going to run out of ideas? When are we going to run out of delivery mechanisms? The answer to both of those individually is never. Combine them both together and it’s just build games forever. You’ll always have a new way — Tim Ferriss: Option. Elan Lee: — to deliver it. Tim Ferriss: All right, so I’m trying to think of anything that we missed. I do have a tantalizing offer for listeners and viewers just for fun because why not? And we will have also mentioned that in the intro. But before I get to that, anything critical that we’ve forgotten? Is there anything that we have left out or any other resources, people to watch, maybe people to Google and Wikipedia maybe? Anything at all? Elan Lee: All right. I’ve got two. I’ve got two that are interesting. One is there is a podcast I quite like for game design, it’s called Fun Problems, it’s with Peter and AJ. And all they do is they talk about game design. Now, they do talk about more hardcore games than I am accustomed to. It’s a wide range of topics, but it’s fun stuff and it’s worth listening to if you want to know more about game design. And the second thing is, because of you. Because of you, because of this process, this journey that we’ve been on over the last few years, I realized that I don’t document any of this ever. I never talk about what goes into a game design, I never talk about where to buy blank cards, and I never talk about why anybody can do this and what the process is like. I’ve started recording it and I started for the first time, I can’t believe I’m saying this, I actually started a YouTube channel and you can actually go and watch these instructional videos. Literally if you want to make a game, the whole idea is: here is how to make a game from scratch. Nobody’s watching right now, but — Tim Ferriss: YouTube.com at Elan Lee, that’s E-L-A-N-L-E-E. You can also just search him on YouTube. The first result will be our podcast together. Elan Lee: That’s true. Tim Ferriss: Episode one. And then within the first few results, you’ll also find it. But I’m pretty sure the URL is YouTube.com/@ElanLee. And let’s finish up with a few things. The first will be the tantalizing offer that I mentioned. The tantalizing offer is this, there’s no purchase required whatsoever, so if any sweepstakes sharks are out there, take it easy, take it easy. This is going to be just a fun little, it’s not even a competition, just a fun little experiment that I want to run. *** [Interview pauses] 02:46:00 to 02:48:14 Tim Ferriss: Hi, everyone, Tim here with an update, as details have changed since that first conversation with Elan. Here’s the tantalizing offer that I wanted to share with you. You have two very easy ways to enter for a chance to win a trip to a secret Los Angeles mansion for an unforgettable day or evening with me and Elan and maybe some special guests. Here’s how. Option number one, simply visit any Target or Walmart and take a fun photo or video with a Coyote game. No purchase necessary. Option number two, if you already bought Coyote, record yourself playing the game with friends or family. That’s it. I would love to see it. Then share your photo or video on Instagram or Tik Tok or both and tag me and ExplodingKittens. You can find us easily, but I’m @TimFerris on both. That’s @ Tim F-e-r-r-i-s-s and Exploding Kittens is ExplodingKittens on Tik Tok and @GameOfKittens on Instagram. So share your photo and or video on Instagram and or Tik Tok. Put them everywhere. Why not? And tag both me and Exploding Kittens. Longtime listeners know that I have a love of deadlines. This is how things actually get done. So, the deadline to post is August 17. That means that 10:00 p.m. PDT August 17. By then, you need to have posted and done all this stuff. By August 31st, we’ll randomly select five winners from people who post. Each winner will receive roundtrip airfare within the US, one night at a hotel, and will join us at our secret LA mansion party. And I think the legal elves wanted me to mention that that’s going to be coach airfare. So, just to be super clear, important legal disclaimer. No purchase necessary. Open to US residents aged 18 or older. So no little kids, no minotaurs allowed. Void where prohibited. Winners selected at random. Odds depend on number of eligible entries. Travel dates must align with the event likely in September. We are still finalizing the time with the busiest man in show business, Elan Lee himself. For official rules, eligibility details, and final date, please visit tim.blog/rules. So, go ahead, post a creative Tik Tok or Insta real or a photo with Coyote by August 17th, 10 p.m. PDT. Tag us and you might just be celebrating with us in Hollywood this fall. Now, back to the episode. *** [Interview resumes] Tim Ferriss: What else? Anything else to add? I have a little bit. I have one more thing I want to say. Elan Lee: Oh, okay. I want to hear one more thing. Tim Ferriss: I just wanted to thank you so much for allowing me to be part of this incredible ride — Elan Lee: Oh, my goodness. Tim Ferriss: — and just collaborating on the game. It’s been so meaningful for me and so much fun and so great to get closer with you and your family, and we’ve all been traveling together since. Elan Lee: I love it. Tim Ferriss: And to work with the incredible team that you have at Exploding Kittens. I’m not going to mention them all because there are quite few — Elan Lee: So many. Tim Ferriss: — but it’s just been such a joy and a dream come true to actually have this thing in my mind that was floating around that I’ve always wanted to do. And now here it is and people can get it. Elan Lee: Tim Ferriss made a game. Look, here’s the thing — Tim Ferriss: I’m thinking — Elan Lee: — you’re so welcome and thank you. We have limited time here and you have to choose your endeavors wisely, and this was one of the wisest choices I’ve ever made. Tim Ferriss: Oh, thanks, man. All right. We’re going to go get a fantastic meal. It’s Texas, so probably a bunch of meat, barbecue. Who knows, maybe some tequila and make an appearance unbidden. You never know. Strange things happen out here in Austin, Texas. And for everybody listening, we will link to all sorts of things, many resources that will help you think about how you might create a game. You could start with the blank cards in Coyote. Those will actually teach you a lot, I think, as you begin to experiment with these different elements. Elan Lee: Because you’re going to fail, because your first few are not going to work and you’ll learn why. Tim Ferriss: And then if you run out of blank cards, look, just go get some blank cards. Just go buy a blank deck and you can use those. But this is something anyone can do. You did this with your daughter when she was how old? Elan Lee: Four. Tim Ferriss: Four. This is an incredibly fun family activity. It’s an incredibly fun friend activity and it gets you off of your screens. It’s not good for you folks. Elan Lee: So important. Tim Ferriss: They are tools, but there is a point at which the tools become our masters and that is where a lot of the poison seeps in around the cracks. Elan Lee: This thing builds memories. That’s what you should be doing. That’s what your phone isn’t doing. This is building memories. Tim Ferriss: Building memories with some durability, not ephemera that get pushed out of your head as soon as you watch the next 10-second clip. This is something I’ve wanted to do for so long and I’m thrilled that it’s here. Fingers crossed. I’m still nervous as hell, obviously. But we’ve done so much play testing. Hundreds of people have play tested at this point and have made these fine-tuning tweaks along the way. I would love everybody to think about your life as a collection of games. You may not be aware of which games you’re playing just yet, but rest assured in some respects you are playing games and you get to choose more games than you realize. Most of them are optional, not all of them. Sure, we have responsibilities as adults and so on, but this is a way to open up that Pandora’s box of possibility. And we’ll include a lot of resources in the show notes, so tim.blog/podcast, just search Coyote. That’ll probably be the easiest way to find it. C-O-Y-O-T-E. And another time I’ll explain the backstory there, which is pretty wild, but for another time. And until next time, as always, be a little kinder than is necessary, not just to others, also to yourself. Play wisely. Find fun problems. And I’m going to check out that podcast. And life is short, have fun while you’re here, folks. And until next time, thanks for tuning in. Δ Δ Comment Rules: Remember what Fonzie was like? Cool. That's how we're gonna be — cool.

Title: Bitcoin Holds Strong Near All-Time High – Market Not Overheated Yet, Data Shows

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin is holding firm above the $115,000 level after several days of trading below it, signaling renewed strength in the market. The bullish tone is building as Ethereum posts massive gains and altcoins begin to show strong moves over the past few days. For some analysts, this could be the start of the long-awaited altseason; for others, it’s simply the rest of the market catching up to Bitcoin’s earlier rally. Top analyst Axel Adler noted that Bitcoin’s price is now trading close to its all-time high, with the BTC Z-Score (Price, 30/365) sitting around +1.5σ above its one-year norm. This reading is well below the +2.5σ level typically associated with overheating, suggesting that while momentum is strong, it is not yet at extreme levels. The current environment offers a favorable backdrop for potential upside, with room for the market to expand further before reaching overheated conditions. With altcoins gaining traction and Ethereum’s rally adding fuel to the market’s optimism, the coming days could determine whether this is a sustainable breakout or just another phase of consolidation before the next major move. According to Adler, Bitcoin’s current market setup is showing a positive backdrop but with some important caveats. Adler points out that the Adjusted Price Divergence (APD) remains negative near −1.5 after rebounding from local lows around −2. This metric suggests that Bitcoin’s price is still outpacing on-chain activity, although the gap between the two is narrowing. In other words, while price momentum is firm, the network’s transactional activity and usage haven’t yet fully caught up. This discrepancy creates an interesting dynamic for the market. Adler explains that the bias still favors price, meaning momentum is being driven more by investor positioning and sentiment than by on-chain fundamentals. For the rally to gain more structural support, a healthier setup would see APD move toward zero. This could happen in one of two ways: either network activity increases significantly while price moves sideways or posts modest gains, or Bitcoin’s price cools off to better align with current usage levels. Importantly, Adler warns against interpreting APD moving toward zero as a direct buy or sell signal. Instead, it represents a sign of normalization — a point where market price and underlying network fundamentals are better aligned. For now, Bitcoin’s technical and macro backdrop remains bullish, but sustained long-term growth will likely require the network to catch up with price action. Bitcoin is consolidating above the $115,724 support level after a brief dip below it earlier this month. The daily chart shows price stabilizing just above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), currently near $113,324, which has acted as a strong dynamic support throughout the recent uptrend. The short-term structure remains bullish, with BTC trading inside a range between $115,724 support and the $122,077 resistance level. Volume has tapered off slightly since the early August rebound, suggesting the market is in a wait-and-see mode before a potential breakout. A decisive close above $118,000 could invite another test of the $122,077 resistance, a key level that has capped upside attempts multiple times. If broken, this could open the door toward new all-time highs. On the downside, losing $115,724 would shift focus to the 100-day SMA at $108,983 as the next major support. Until then, the higher-lows pattern suggests buyers are defending the mid-$115K zone aggressively.

Tim Leunig US stock market outperformance reliesÂ on the âMagnificent 7â: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google, Android), Meta, Nvidia andÂ Tesla. Over the last decade, these stocks typically returned at least 500%. Without them, stock market rises would have been less than 2% aÂ year, afterÂ inflation. Pretty much everyone has an Apple or an Android phone. A new firm would struggle to break into that duopoly. Nokia, Blackberry: they came and went. Apple and Alphabet would have to really mess up to be in trouble. Walmart will do its best to cut Amazon down to size, but economies of scale in online retail and delivery are real.

But Tesla is vulnerable. Not because some people hate Musk for supporting Trump; or because others hate him for attacking Trump. But because lots of good, rival electric cars mean Tesla has no market power. In 2013, Autocar magazine described theÂ Tesla Model S as âa triumphâ, its 300-mile range about three times that of any other electric car available. Add in the supercharger network â then exclusively restricted to Tesla â and Teslas were the only EV that worked like a normal car. That gave the firm market power. Today, by contrast, while a Â£40,000 Tesla Model 3 can travel 320 miles, a 380-mile Kia EV3 costs a couple of thousands less. Teslaâs 430-mile longer-range Model 3 costs Â£45,000, but just Â£600 extra gets you a 480-mile Mercedes-Benz CLA. Tesla has a competitive offer, but it is not unique, and that hits pricing and margins. Outside of the US, Tesla produces only two, relatively similar, cars. It has no rival to this yearâs Car of the Year, the Â£23,000 electric Renault 5. As a contrast, Hyundai offers five EVs, ranging from the tiny Inster to the massive Ioniq 9. Whatever type of EV you want, Hyundai can help. Competitive pressure means Teslaâs net income was lower in 2024 than in any post-pandemic year. Related articles: Elon Muskâs $30bn Tesla stock option proves CEO pay in Silicon Valley is âbonkersâ Patricia Clarke Muskâs chatbot praises Hitler then says âsorry, my bad, I fell for a hoaxâ John Naughton The Chris Riddell cartoon: draining the swamp Chris Riddell Tesla has a second revenue stream: selling carbon credits to other car firms. The US requires car firms to lower their average CO2 emissions, while Europe requires them to sell a minimum proportion of EVs. Companies that fail can buy credits from firms, such as Tesla, that do better. Unfortunately for Tesla, President Trump has abolished this requirement in the US, destroying that revenue stream. In Europe, the EU has weakened the standard a little, reducing the value of credits. In any case, there are no credits to sell if you donât sell cars, and Teslaâs European sales have halved in the past year. Tesla is a bet on Elon Musk. That is why he can successfully demand an additional $30bn with the threat that he will otherwise walk away. That $30bn is a straightforward reduction in returns to shareholders. Shares in a company where the CEO can take so much of the upside, even in bad times, should not trade at high valuations. Capitalism can be cruel and merciless to companies that invent. All too often the second- and third-placed companies overtake the original innovator. Henry Fordâs production line cut the price of the Model T from $825 to $260 between 1908 and 1925, an 80% real-terms fall. Despite his genius, General Motors sold more cars than Ford by 1927. They copied Fordâs production line, and offered buyers a âcar for every purse and purposeâ. The parallels between then and now are uncanny: an autocratic, rather odd, genius inventor (Ford, Musk) achieved something amazing, and yet the dull-as-ditchwater corporate follower (GM, Hyundai) wins out. Perhaps Hyundai bosses have been reading business history books, and realise Tesla is as vulnerable now as Ford was then. The future for Tesla is probably muchÂ like that of Ford after the 1920s â just another erratically profitable car firm, with a share price to match.

Title: TCS layoffs mark end of one IT era, and the start of another

Time Published: 2025-08-10T02:35:08Z
Full Content:
“The future is already here; it’s just not evenly distributed,” goes the famous quote. Well, neither are job losses — or so the 12,000 laid-off employees of TCS might be ruefully thinking as they packed their personal effects, while simultaneously reading about the $100m salaries that Mark Zuckerberg was dangling to lure AI researchers to his company. There has been a spate of layoffs in tech companies, with Microsoft firing 15,000 employees, Intel 5,000, and Meta and Amazon joining the party. Much of the losses were ascribed to AI, which is driving workforce efficiencies and empowering one human to do the job of many. Till now, most of the layoffs were happening in far-off places like the US and Europe, but the TCS announcement that it was letting go 2% of the workforce brought this phenomenon closer home. Companies like TCS have traditionally been seen as a safe harbour, the closest to a ‘govt job’ in terms of stability and tenure. It had remained so through the dotcom bust, the financial crisis and others. But now, with the advent of AI, the myth seems to be busted. While TCS is the most prominent example, it is not alone. Big consulting firms are ‘streamlining’ their workforce, other big IT services firms are making disturbing noises, and job portals are teeming with tech workers’ resumes. TCS has gone to great lengths to not pin the blame on AI. But the subtext of terms like “a skill mismatch” and “future-ready” is hard to ignore. In many ways, this has been a long time coming. The IT services model of cost-arbitrage, deploying vast armies of coders and consultants at lower cost, has been in its twilight era for a while. AI just accelerated the trend, disrupting the existing linear model where more projects meant hiring more people. Now, a human analyst and a few AI agents working together can potentially do what ten analysts once did. In its place, a new kind of IT services firm is emerging — leaner, AI-native, and outcome-focused. These firms will not hire a thousand freshers to handle client reports or debug software, but deploy a small team of AI-literate experts and a suite of autonomous agents to do the job faster, cheaper, and often better. We are seeing early glimpses already, with new services startups using agents like Cursor or Devin, legal firms operating with Harvey, and research teams powered by Perplexity and NotebookLM. The societal impact of this transition in India will be immense. The whole education model of training young people in STEM skills to then place them in some IT company ensuring a stable career with a decent salary is under threat. However, this tectonic shift presents as great an opportunity as the magnitude of the threat. This is especially true for younger, entry-level employees, since “breaking first is the bottom rung of the career ladder” as Aneesh Raman, the chief economic opportunity officer at LinkedIn, wrote. However, with every crisis, including this one, comes great opportunity. These are five things I believe young people should do in this inevitable age of AI: Leapfrog with AI: The definition of literacy now includes the ability to work fluently and naturally with AI tools and agents. If you know how to, you can take AI’s help to do jobs the seniors traditionally did and jump straight to the second or third rung of the job ladder. In a recent post, for example, a tech founder offered a programmer with 2-5 years of experience a Rs 1 crore salary — qualifications and experience were not important, just the use of AI to code. Study humanities with STEM: Prompting is about knowledge, creativity, critical thinking, literature and grammar — core humanities skills. As answers become a commodity with AI, questions or ‘prompts’ will become the differentiator. Don’t just join a company, build one: There has been no better time to create a company with AI tools, agents, and ‘vibe coding’ available to everyone. It is the age of one-person unicorns — one human and a thousand AI agents building billion-dollar startups. Build a career portfolio: Don’t do just one thing. Be a product designer who also writes; a digital marketer who teaches music; a coder who also runs a pet shop. With AI, one company, many employees will give way to one employee with many companies. Build your personal brand: Do not depend on where you work for your identity; leverage AI to build your own through the talents you have or learn. You will never be out of paying work. As Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella put it: “AI is not here to replace humans. It is here to remove the barriers that prevent humans from doing their best work.” This crisis gives us the opportunity to do precisely that. (Jaspreet Bindra is the founder of AI&Beyond. His latest book is ‘Winning With AI: Your Guide to AI Literacy’) Views expressed above are the author's own.

by Michael Snyder | Aug 9, 2025 | Economics | 1 comment This article was originally published by Michael Snyder at The Economic Collapse Blog. If everything is going to be just fine, why are thousands of stores closing all over the country? So far this year, the total amount of retail space that has been permanently closed has surpassed 120 million square feet. We have never seen anything like this before. Store closings spiked during the early days of the pandemic, but in 2025, stores are being permanently shuttered at an even faster pace. In fact, during the first six months of this year, 5,822 store closures were recorded… Store closures across the U.S. continue to rise, and remain on track to far significantly surpass both new openings and the figures seen in 2024. According to a new report from research and advisory firm Coresight Research, cited by CoStar News, 5,822 store closures were recorded as of June 27, compared to 3,496 closures announced during the same period of 2024. If stores continue to close at this rate, we will break the old record that was established during the pandemic by a wide margin. We are also being told that the total amount of retail space that has been permanently shuttered in 2025 has reached a staggering 120 million square feet… In June, store closings by Plano, Texas-based home goods seller At Home and Philadelphia-based pharmacy chain Rite Aid, which have both filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, “pushed the total amount of retail space to close in the U.S. this year to over 120 million square feet,” Coresight said. The real estate churn is happening “as cyclical impacts confront structural shifts,” according to one executive at the research firm. Wow. You may have noticed that there are an increasing number of abandoned buildings in your particular area. Sadly, this is just the beginning. Consumers are under more financial stress than we have ever seen, and that has resulted in a substantial decline in store traffic… Many of the retail store closures are a result of declining store traffic as more consumers respond to inflation by reducing spending. There also are more consumers turning to online shopping especially for apparel, accessories and household items. The winner is not merely Amazon but increased competition from Temu and Shein marketplaces and social commerce outlets like TikTok. Needless to say, more stores are being closed down with each passing day. After filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Claire’s announced that it will be closing 18 more stores… Claire’s, a mall-based teen accessories retailer, has identified several locations across the country it plans to close after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Claire’s U.S., which operates Claire’s and Icing stores, made the filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware on Wednesday. It’s the second time since 2018 the company has filed for bankruptcy. While the company says the majority of its retail stores will remain open while it “continues to explore all strategic alternatives,” Claire’s said it identified 18 stores ahead of the Aug. 6 bankruptcy filing it would close, filings show. And home goods retailer At Home just announced that it will be closing 6 more stores… The home goods retailer At Home is closing an additional six stores across the country, bringing its total closure tally to more than two dozen as it grapples with high debt and dwindling sales. The furniture and home decor retailer based in Coppell, Texas, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 16, pointing to “broader economic and retail-specific market pressures,” in court documents. The bankruptcy filing and store closures follow several other “big box” retailers that have also significantly downsized their brick-and-mortar footprints this year, including Big Lots, Joann Fabrics, Kohl’s, JCPenney, Macy’s, and Party City. The retailer intially announced 26 store closures in June, before paring that down to 24 when it decided to keep open two stores in New Jersey and Wisconsin. The company added another six stores to the list, according to a statement by retail firm Hilco Consumer-Retail on Aug. 1, bringing the current number of stores it will shutter in the coming months to 30. We see more stories like this every single day. So what is going to happen if our economic momentum continues to take us very rapidly in the wrong direction? Earlier today, we learned that the percentage of student loans entering serious delinquency is absolutely exploding… The total amount of outstanding student loan debt was $1.64 trillion in the second quarter of 2025 after rising by $7 billion in the quarter. Additionally, the share of student loan debt entering serious delinquency, considered 90 days or more late, jumped to 12.9% at the end of June, up from 8% in March and above pre-pandemic trends that were around 9-10% from 2012 into early 2020, when the moratorium initially took effect. The American people are drowning in debt, and I expect delinquency rates of all types to continue to rise in the months ahead. We are going to see more layoffs too, and the fact that continuing claims for unemployment benefits just hit their highest level since 2021 is not a good sign at all… Recurring applications for unemployment benefits surged to the highest since November 2021, adding to recent signs that the labor market is weakening. Continuing claims, a proxy for the number of people receiving benefits, rose by 38,000 to 1.97 million in the week ended July 26, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. On top of everything else, U.S. manufacturing activity is now in contraction territory… From March to July, U.S. manufacturing activity contracted, according to the Institute for Supply Management’s monthly survey. The Manufacturing PMI last registered at 48, below the 50 score that differentiates growth and decline. The effective average tariff rate on all imported goods now stands at around roughly 18% versus 2.3% last year, the highest levels since the 1930s. We are in so much trouble. After evaluating all of the latest economic numbers that have come in, Mark Zandi has come to the conclusion that the “economy is on the precipice of recession”… Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, on Monday wrote a post on X that the “economy is on the precipice of recession” – citing the weaker-than-expected jobs report released Friday and the inflation data from the previous day that showed consumer prices rose as indicating the economy’s precarious position. “Consumer spending has flatlined, construction and manufacturing are contracting, and employment is set to fall. And with inflation on the rise, it is tough for the Fed to come to the rescue,” he wrote. It is hard to argue with him. Of course what is eventually coming is going to be so much worse than just a “recession”. As conditions deteriorate, will store closings slow down or will they speed up? The answer to that question is obvious. If there are stores in your local area that you really enjoy, I would visit them now while you still can, because they might not be there next year.

Title: Cloud Quarterly: Azure AI pop, AWS supply pinch and Google execution

UPDATED 11:25 EDT / AUGUST 09 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Artificial intelligence is currently running on a one-lane CapEx highway that is capacity-constrained. Hyperscaler cloud providers are the largest contributor to the momentum and as such, investors keep score with cloud growth rates. But this past quarter you had to read the footnotes and the fine print to go beyond the massive investments fueling the wave. Microsoft Corp. put up eye-popping Azure growth again, but a big part of that acceleration is Azure serving AI inference — notably OpenAI’s ChatGPT — now neatly included in the revised definition of what’s included in Azure. This is great for headlines but not conducive to apples-to-apples comparisons over time. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services Inc. delivered the largest revenue for cloud infrastructure and sent a clear message that demand exceeds supply — meaning growth is capped by power and components, not pipeline. That creates a weird optics penalty — AWS showing growth in the high teens on a $120 billion-plus run rate and it’s deemed “concerning.” But it also telegraphs future upside as capacity goes online and depreciation cycles progress. The somewhat stealth story is Google LLC. Google Cloud posted a strong quarterly print with solid top-line growth and steadily improving operating margin — and GCP (the infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service portion of the business) is growing materially faster than cloud overall – our estimate is nearly 40%. Google’s backlog is building at more than $250 million and $1 billion-plus deals continue to close thanks to Google’s underlying tech, a strong data foundation and its AI prowess. As the mix shifts toward AI-heavy, infrastructure-centric workloads, it becomes a tailwind for Google, which continues to lag the scale of AWS and Azure. The common thread is a capital expenditure arms race that faces real constraints. All three players said that power, sites, servers and lead times will dictate who wins AI inference and who can monetize it. Microsoft is capacity-constrained, AWS says it will take “several quarters” to rebalance, and Google raised its CapEx guide. As such, we believe strongly that this is not a one-quarter story; it’s a multiyear power grab that will determine margin structures and cash flow for the next cycle. All told, the the big three cloud players are on a pace to spend about $240 billion this calendar year on CapEx with, AI revenue coming in at about 10% of that figure. We clearly have a big hurdle before that massive investment pays back. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on our latest take of the cloud infrastructure market with a fresh look at growth rates in context, market share projections for the year, and the puts and takes for each of the big three from their earnings prints. We’ll also share some spending data from Enterprise Technology Research and a look at the road ahead. The big three U.S. hyperscalers just put up roughly $60 bilion of IaaS/PaaS revenue, and all-in IaaS/PaaS grew about 27% year-over-year. Importantly, that’s a one-point acceleration sequentially — all while demand is still outrunning supply. Margins continue to be divergent. AWS came in around 33% operating margin, down from 39% last quarter as depreciation and its seasonal stock based comp step-up hit — all with continued capacity constraints. Google Cloud, while far less profitable continues to show material improvement. Operating margin increased to roughly 21%, up from ~18% last quarter and 11% a year ago — showing, steady execution. Microsoft is a bit more opaque on its cloud operating margin as Azure drags margins down, but the company gave us some solid hints and a first-time Azure revenue disclosure. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $46.7 billion, up 27%, with gross margin 68%, down 2 points aI infrastructure scales and the mix shifts toward lower margin Azure. But for the first time, Microsoft put a number on Azure at $75 billion for the fiscal year — but remember, recent definition changes and the AI inference boost muddy apples-to-apples comparisons and contain a clever communications strategy by Microsoft. CapEx is the real story, however. The trio — plus Meta Platforms Inc. — shelled out about $87 billion in the June quarter. By our math, ~75% of Amazon’s CapEx is for AWS, underscoring the supply buildup. The bottom line is Azure’s AI pop is real (but fattened by ChatGPT inference), AWS is constrained but investing through it, and Google is quietly widening margins while it scales. Let’s take a look at the key performance indicators and do a quick scan of the metrics that matter: Microsoft: Microsoft Cloud came in at $46.7 billion for the quarter (+27% y/y) and Intelligent Cloud $29.9 billion (+26%) with Azure and other cloud +39% y/y (CC); Microsoft didn’t disclose its quarterly Azure performance but we’ve mapped our models to the $75 billion figure and estimate Azure IaaS/PaaS at ~$22.2 billion; with Azure AI services at ~$3 billion. Management guided that demand exceeds supply into 1H FY26 (2H CY 25), with its Q1 FY CapEx guided to $30 billion-plus. AWS: AWS revenue was $30.9 billion (+17.5% y/y; $124B ARR) with 32.9% operating margin pressured by seasonal SBC and higher depreciation; we peg AI services at around $2B for AWS. Backlog hit $195 bilion and CapEx stayed heavy ($24 biion of Amazon’s $31.4 billion in Q2 went to AWS by our estimates). Supply constraints continue but are expected to improve over several quarters. Google Cloud: Google Cloud posted $13.6 billion (+32% y/y) and 20.7% operating margin; we estimate GCP (IaaS/PaaS) at ~$7.2B, growing “much faster” than Google Cloud overall, with GCP AI services around ~$0.6B. Capex was $22.4B in Q2 and the 2025 outlook was raised to ~$85 billion (higher again in 2026) with backlog at $106 billion and capacity tight into 2026. Now lets look at the plusses and minuses for each player. Pluses: Azure is still ripping — ~39% growth with management guiding to ~37% cc next quarter even while capacity-constrained. We think it will be even higher – perhaps as high as 40% with GPT-5. A $368 billion RPO (+37% y/y) says the the company has a long runway, and foundry/agent adoption combined with surging token throughput says Microsoft has found a true AI platform flywheel. But it appears heavily tied to OpenAI, which is broadening it ecosystem horizontally with new open source models. Software efficiencies are kicking in with (“~90% more tokens per graphics processing unit” year on year) – without this, the gross-margin drag from scaling AI infrastructure would be much worse. The other welcome positive is the $75 billion Azure disclosure. Minuses: Microsoft still won’t disclose an Azure operating margin and is cagey around cloud operating margin. Overall Microsoft Cloud gross margin fell ~2 points year-over-year, pressured by Azure’s AI mix. Supply remains tight through 1H FY26, implying some demand is being pushed, and a significant piece of Azure’s momentum appears tied to ChatGPT inference and to reporting definitional changes, which confuse the growth rate relative to historical reporting. Pluses: Still the revenue leader and despite the drop in operating margin from the high 30s to ~32.9%, AWS remains profitable for what is essentially a company that sells access to hardware resources. Demand exceeds supply; backlog sits at ~$195 billion (+25% y/y) and the AI stack runs deep and wide — from Trainium2 to Bedrock plus AgentCore/Kiro announced at NYC Summit and a vast ecosystem that gives AWS customers choice and the company full-stack leverage. Minuses: Headline growth of ~17.5% trails Azure/GCP and invites lazy comparisons. Let’s face it – AWS is getting outmarketed right now by Microsoft when it comes to cloud momentum. Heavy CapEx means elevated depreciation and, with capacity expected to rebalance over “several quarters,” near-term upside may be capped. Pluses: Google Cloud is hitting a nice combo of scale and improving profitability — ~32% growth with ~20.7% operating margin — and GCP (IaaS/PaaS + AI) is growing much faster than overall cloud (tCR est. ~39%). Backlog momentum is real at ~$106 billion, with $250 million-plus deals doubling and $1 billion-plus wins in 1H25 matching all of 2024. Minuses: Capacity remains tight into 2026, which could pace revenue recognition, and Alphabet flagged an acceleration in depreciation as CapEx grows — both potential margin headwinds. Disclosure on pure IaaS/PaaS remains less granular, so we’re relying on qualitative signals and survey data for GCP’s exact mix shift. Let’s zoom out and take a look at the annual revenue and market share forecasts: Cloud infrastructure is now a quarter-trillion-dollar market. In 2025, the Big 3+ Alibaba will clear about $259 billion in IaaS/PaaS revenue, up roughly 26% year over year. AWS remains the revenue leader at ~$126.6 billion, but its growth cadence — ~18% — is well below Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform, both running high-30s. Azure is the big story: ~$87.7 billion in 2025E IaaS/PaaS, with growth juiced by AI inference volumes and Microsoft’s shifts in what it counts as ‘Azure.’ GCP is a solid No. 3 at ~$28.3 billion, growing about as fast as Azure from a smaller base. Share shifts continue. AWS drops about 4 points of IaaS/PaaS share since 2024 to ~48.6%. Microsoft picks up ~4 points to ~35.3%, while Google holds steady around ~10%. Put differently: Azure + GCP are growing at a combined ~38% versus AWS at ~18% — that gap continues to attract negative attention to AWS. Underneath the revenue lines is an unprecedented CapEx cycle. The big three are on pace to pour roughly $240 billion a year into data centers, power and servers to feed AI demand. Yet 2025 AI services revenue is only on the order of ~$25 billion from these three, which means heavy front-loading — that is, lots of spend now for monetization that (hopefully) scales later. The bottom line is AWS still throws off the most dollars, but Microsoft’s definition-plus-AI strategy is gaining share fast, and Google is quietly compounding with evidence of improved profitability and a long runway. Let’s look at the nuances of interpreting the growth rates and the games vendors play with numbers. The Azure revenue trajectory has been quite remarkable as shown in the chart above. Entering COVID, we estimate that Microsoft Azure was generating roughly $4 billion per quarter. Today, our estimates indicate that Azure is running at more than $21 billion per quarter growing in the high 30% range. Note the revenue flattening in 2024 roughly coincides with the removal of the Enterprise Mobility, Security and Power BI per-user pricing revenue within Azure definitions. It replaced those low growth businesses with smaller but faster growing AI. As such you see the Azure curve steeply rises into 2025 as Azure AI services kick in. The timing was right and Microsoft disclosed that Azure has surpassed $75 billion. [See our detailed analysis of the Azure financial disclosures and the definitional changes] Microsoft’s FY 2025 ends in CY Q2 2025 and the $75 billion figure corresponds to the CY periods comprising Q3 2024 through Q2 2025. In our view, Microsoft cleverly timed its reclassification of Azure revenue and the $75 billion disclosure to underscore its substantial revenue base and its significantly higher growth rate relative to AWS. But this is the “growth optics” slide – the games people play. The bottom half of the above chart tries to put everyone on the same field. AWS did ~$30.9 billion IaaS/PaaS in the quarter, up 17.5%. Mapping to the $75 billion figure, we have Microsoft at ~$22.2 billion, +39%. If you normalize for the ChatGPT uplift and Microsoft’s definitional tweaks, our range for ‘core Azure’ is ~$18.5 billion to $19.0 billion growing in the mid-30s; or, by its previous definitions, 20%. At that size, AWS historically also grew in the mid-30s, so the meme that “AWS is lagging” is mostly rate-of-change noise. Google Cloud Platform is ~$7.2 billion, growing ~38% to 39%. Strong, but when AWS was at ~$7 billion, it was growing at ~45%, so this isn’t unprecedented hypergrowth. Net-net: The market is ripping, but a lot of Azure’s pop is AI inference optics. George Gilbert points out that Microsoft doesn’t want to highlight the fact that it has a ChatGPT tiger by the tail. Probably 50% of OpenAI’s revenue goes to COGs – that is, Azure fees. The point is, strip that out and the growth curves of AWS and Azure converge when normalizing for size of business over time. Nonetheless – AWS remains the dollar leader, Azure is gaining share with these AI/OpenAI tailwinds, and GCP is executing cleanly off a smaller base. Let’s look at some of the spending data from ETR on the big three cloud players. ETR’s Shared-Net Score data shows spending momentum still favoring Azure. Remember this is account-based not revenue-based. In Jul 2025, Azure posts a 60.2% Shared Net Score on 986 accounts, well ahead of AWS at 45.3% (N=784) and GCP at 36.2% (N=437) out of 1,777 total shared responses. The 40% dotted line indicates highly elevated spending velocity, so despite AWS’s lower score it’s still elevated. Over the last 18 months Azure has held a persistent 60%+ Net Score, consistent with AI-driven expansions and Microsoft’s bundle leverage. AWS softened in late 2023, then recovered into the mid-40s — steady but still capacity-limited. GCP’s momentum cooled through 2024 into mid-2025, now mid-30s, possibly reflecting bigger, longer deal cycles rather than broad-based expansions. The net is: In overlapping accounts, account-share momentum = Azure > AWS > GCP. Here’s a similar slide but it shows the penetration into the data set. Surprisingly, all three are showing deceleration in the pervasiveness metric. This doesn’t fly in the face of the rapid and accelerating cloud growth rates, however what it speaks to is spending is shifting to other categories, namely AI; and possibly some pause in AI experimentation on the cloud and some thought of moving toward on-premises – or balancing in that direction. Again, this data doesn’t represent spending levels, rather it represents account penetration. Microsoft is ubiquitous and speaks to why Azure’s penetration is so high. AWS continues to broaden its footprint with shared-account penetration GCP is still the third player and quite a distance from the leaders. Let’s close with a look at things to watch going forward. Here’s the bottom line heading into H2 and the 2026 window on the bull and bear cases: We’re tracking three swing factors that will decide the leaderboard — agent adoption, power and silicon. If pilots flip to production and enterprise agents get embedded across Microsoft M365, Google Workspace and custom apps, we may get a second-wave of cloud migration and real productivity gains. For AWS, which lacks a ubiquitous collaboration software platform it must rely primarily on its builders. Offerings around Q Developer are critical for developers to create software and apps on the AWS platform. But if customers don’t see broad-based return on investment and they suffer from proof-of-concept fatigue, things could slow. Of course, we’re always watching the macro spending picture as well, which right now is cautious outside AI. We’re also looking at the pace of CapEx buildouts and permitting – if regulations keep dragging and “short on power” becomes the norm, growth gets slowed by lack of kilowatts, not underlying demand. For silicon designers, like these three – if price/performance keeps improving not only with Nvidia Blackwell GPUs, but in-house silicon such as AWS’ Trainium and Google’s TPUs, and better inference economics, hyperscalers can keep pricing power and this will pull adjacent services. If GPUs remain constrained or customers are concerned about CUDA lock-in and high training costs, that could be a headwind and the bear case is migrations slow and customers may pull back a bit. Sovereign cloud is a monetization tailwind. Microsoft has the strongest hybrid story of the big three with its legacy on-premises Azure stack footprint and there’s evidence that its non-cloud business remains strong. Google is probably even more incentivized to partner for on-prem deployments, while AWS doubles down on VPC-native sovereignty and has Outposts in its back pocket. Policy is the wild card; a pro-innovation framework with licensing/data-use clarity supports spending, while broad antitrust/tariff shocks or an AI-ROI vacuum will cause buyers to tap the brakes. Our base case is that pilots begin converting, power eases gradually, custom silicon improves inference unit economics, and sovereignty continues to be in demand. But the big concern is enterprises continue to struggle with good data. Bad data will constrict AI payback and agentic adoption. That all said, CapEx continues to be the mainspring of AI enthusiasm and the Azure playbook is popping. AWS is not standing still and Google’s quiet execution is showing improved mix and margin, which is encouraging. Watch these signs: agent adoption, weekly active users and token volumes. In addition pay attention to CapEx versus AI revenue realization, the share of inference on non-GPU silicon, sovereign-cloud RFP velocity and any shift in liability rules. If the players hit on these, the cloud up-cycle runs right through 2026. This is our expectation. This is our base case. What’s yours? Please get in touch and let us know.

August 09, 2025 10:54 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. The class action concerns whether Novo Nordisk and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. You have until September 30, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk significantly lowered its sales outlook for 2025. The Company attributed the reduction to “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” On this news, Novo Nordisk’s American Depositary Receipt (“ADR”) price fell $15.06 per ADR, or 21.83%, to close at $53.94 per ADR on July 29, 2025. Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions.

August 09, 2025 10:20 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions.

Title: This 8.5% Dividend Loves A Market Panic

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Volatility is back! And we contrarians know what to do: Get ready to buy. And we don’t have to try to time the depths of the next selloff, either, because the three 7%+ paying, “volatility-loving” dividends we’re going to talk about are perfect for this market. They’re all closed-end funds (CEFs) that see their cash streams grow when markets get skittish. Their secret? They sell covered-call options on their portfolios. This is a smart, low-risk way they can generate extra income—and send it our way as 7%+ dividends. That’s because these funds charge investors a “premium” for the “option” to buy their holdings at a fixed time and date in the future. They keep that cash no matter what happens with the trade itself. And their dividends (and our income) directly benefit. If you’ve been reading my column for a while, you’ll recognize these three covered-call CEFs: the 8.5%-paying Nuveen Dow 30 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (DIAX), the 7.6%-yielding Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX) and the 8.5%-paying Nuveen NASDAQ 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (QQQX). We highlighted all three in my July 24, 2025, Contrarian Outlook article, and our opportunity is still on the table here—with DIAX in particular. I also bring these funds up now because, despite the media’s howling, the current market is simply following an age-old course. It goes like this: As stocks rise, a major news story sparks worries that their gains can’t last. Stocks then sell off on rising investor fear, until the “smart money” comes in to buy the dip. Then the rest of the crowd takes notice and stocks begin to recover. Usually, this cycle happens over a short period—a few weeks, maybe a month or two. A good example is the sharp selloff, and speedy recovery, after President Trump announced large tariffs in April. However, a negative mood can hang on and prolong a selloff. That’s what happened in 2022, when worries of an economic crisis emerged after 2021’s huge run. But that turned out to be wrong, and the economy didn’t start contracting that year, or in 2023, or even in 2024. As a result, stocks recovered, but it took a long time as pundit after pundit wrongly insisted a recession was on its way. Okay, so why am I giving a history lesson here? Because we may very well be on the precipice of a new selloff, with volatility rising again. The trigger was that disappointing jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics last Friday, which included large downward revisions to the previous two months’ readings. It’s worth noting, however, that the economy is still adding jobs, and, if we look at the last five years of data, we’re still far from the calamities of the pandemic. In other words, we’re in the fearmongering stage of the cycle, with the media running story after story about the so-called “big drop” in the labor market. A quick look at the CNN Fear and Greed index, as of this writing, shows us that the extreme-greed mood of the last couple months has flipped to neutral, where it was in March and again at the end of April, after the huge crash earlier that month. However, it’s worth noting that stocks are up both from the end of April and from March. So, if sentiment is cooling, we may see stocks sell off in the short term, then recover strongly a bit later. That’s the scenario I find most likely at this time. One interesting thing about the current market is that, while volatility has jumped a little, it’s nowhere near the spikes associated with big, steep selloffs. This tells us that a near-term selloff isn’t guaranteed, and one will likely only emerge if the current level of the VIX—the market’s so-called “fear gauge”—rises. As you can see above, the VIX recently spiked from an unusually low level, meaning the market is waking up from weeks of complacency. Obviously, in such a market, you can’t just sell everything: If things stay flattish, you might be able to buy back in, but you’ll miss out on dividends. And if stocks see a short-term decline, who’s to say how low it will go and how long it will last? This doesn’t feel like a 2022-style drop, partly because Americans are less fearful than they were shortly after the pandemic. So a short-term market dip is the likeliest outcome, with a flat market a close second. In such a market, the best move is to monetize rising volatility. That’s where our (still-) available opportunity on those three covered-call CEFs comes in. We’re interested in these three because their call options essentially turn rising fear into cash. Plus there’s a big difference in their discounts to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios) we can take advantage of. Note that DIAX (in blue above) trades at a near-11% discount to NAV as of this writing, even though its 8.5% yield matches that of QQQX, which has a much narrower 7.5% discount. And SPXX, with its smaller 7.6% yield, trades at just a 1.9% discount! This is odd, since CEF investors love high yields and tend to price up higher-yielding funds. And as of now, SPXX pays the least and has the smallest discount. That’s the one part of this that makes sense, and the reason is fairly straightforward: The S&P 500 is the best-known index, so many investors blindly pile into SPXX for that reason. But consider the fact that DIAX has a higher yield (8.5%, you’ll recall), a bigger discount (nearly 11%, as shown in the chart above) and holds solid blue chips like 3M (MMM), American Express (AXP), Boeing (BA), Coca-Cola (KO) and Procter & Gamble (PG). This means it’s likelier to see higher volatility in the short term (especially since its portfolio only includes 30 stocks—those in the Dow). But that’s a plus, as these option strategies do best in volatile markets. That should raise demand for DIAX, causing its near-11% discount to shrink. And that’s why, right now, DIAX is a compelling hedge for short-term volatility. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Qidi Plus 4

The Qidi Plus 4’s chamber heating and high-temperature direct drive system set this $799 printer apart from the rest of its midrange competitors. Positioned between Creality’s affordability and Bambu’s innovation, Qidi emphasizes material versatility, consistent print quality, and enclosure-driven performance. While some 3D printing enthusiasts are happy to stop with ASA or ABS filaments—popular units like the Bambu Lab A1 check most of the boxes for most people—others have projects that require higher-quality and more-durable materials like nylon and polycarbonate. For these and several other use cases, the Plus 4 represents an exceptional value and a solid upgrade from the more beginner-friendly A1. It wins an Editors' Choice award as the best filament-based 3D printer for hobbyists. Qidi entered the consumer 3D printing market in 2014, focusing on enclosed, user-friendly FDM printers at a time when most competitors—including Creality—were emphasizing open-frame, DIY-style machines. While Creality gained popularity with its budget-friendly, modifiable Ender series, Qidi built its reputation on plug-and-play reliability and sturdy enclosures, making early models like the Qidi Tech I and X-Pro popular in educational and office environments. As the industry shifted toward speed, automation, and high-temperature capabilities—especially following Bambu Lab’s 2022 launch of the X1 Carbon—Qidi responded with machines like the X-Plus, X-Max, and ultimately the Plus 4. For a while, I watched this evolution from afar, sticking with my finicky LulzBot TAZ 5 for the better part of a decade. (Oh, the fun of leveling a square bed that has only three leveling screws...but I digress.) The mechanical engineer in me knew it was time for a new printer, and not an entry-level unit like the Bambu Lab A1 Mini (as venerated and reliable as it is). I wanted something with more ability than that; a class above it. I decided to see if the Plus 4 could fit the bill, and I purchased the unit I'm reviewing here, rather than receiving a loaner from Qidi. The Plus 4 weighs 60 pounds, which is definitely not in the featherweight class. Its footprint is no slouch either, coming in at 19.8 by 19.2 by 21.7 inches (HWD) compared with the Prusa Core One's 21.8 by 16.3 by 17.5 inches. (The increased size is partly thanks to the steel-frame enclosure.) While I had no problem finding room for the machine—I've got a dedicated maker space in my house—users with limited space will find it bulky to move or fit. Qidi compensates for this by building grab handles into the top of the unit, but it can be daunting for a single person to move. I needed my son to help me get it up the stairs. With a 12-by-12-by-11-inch build area, the Plus 4 supports large prints and multi-part assemblies, ideal for prototyping, making cosplay props, or short-run manufacturing. Dimensionally, the Plus 4 slightly outpaces its closest rivals, the Bambu Lab P1 and X1 Carbon, whose build volumes are 10 cubic inches. The Plus 4 comes with an active chamber heater, which warms the interior to around 150 degrees F in about 8 minutes when it's running at 400 watts. (Early firmware versions let the chamber heater pull up to 800 watts, which exceeded the safety ratings of the included solid-state relay [SSR], creating a potential fire risk. While Qidi issued a firmware cap to 400 watts, many users still choose to replace the SSR or install thermal fuses out of caution.) The heater promotes stable conditions for high-temperature materials like ABS, polycarbonate, and nylon. By circulating heated air throughout the chamber as opposed to passively retaining heat from the extruder or bed in the chamber, parts are surrounded by a uniform temperature, helping to prevent warping and lifting off of the PEI build plate. (Confused by some of this terminology? Check out our guide to 3D printing to learn the basics.) The Plus 4 also comes standard with a high-temperature direct-drive extruder with a 0.4mm hardened steel nozzle, enabling the use of advanced filaments like polycarbonate, nylon, and carbon-fiber blends, as well as common lower-temperature PLA and TPU. The 80-watt nozzle has a 700-degree-F ceiling with a ceramic heat break to prevent heat creep. The maximum temperature limit means no burnt or malformed nozzle tips, even after printing with filament like polycarbonate. Qidi uses a 6mm-thick aluminum substrate for the heater bed, a sturdier build than the typical 3mm beds found on entry-level printers. This thickness promotes consistent, even heat across the entire surface. (Notably, the surface is capable of 250 degrees F, well above the requirements of most engineering-grade filaments.) The combination of the thick aluminum heater and effective chamber insulation helps heat soak and the filament maintain stable temperatures, which is crucial for consistent first layers. The first thing you’re going to notice when you get the unit is its weight and size. This is one of the most important moments with a new product—how it feels when you take it out of the box. As I touched on above, the unit has thick, sturdy grab handles that are recessed into the frame of the printer. When you pull the machine out and put it on the stand or a nearby table, you know right away it is a heavy, sturdy unit. It feels like it belongs in a factory. I thought, “Someone is thinking about the little things.” I connected the filament spool holder, which goes in the rear left corner of the machine. This location makes sense to me, as I could get to it easily and see from a distance how much filament was left on the roll at any given time. Where placed, the printer felt like a piece of modern furniture. It looks sleek and futuristic, and from a few feet away, you can’t tell that the side panels aren’t aluminum. (You have to touch them to know for sure.) The machine also gets impressively bright via the internal LED; the powerful light makes it easy for my older eyes to work with the unit. I live with a spouse, who is very concerned about the fumes printers can produce and always quizzes me on my remediation plans. As such, I was happy to see that the chamber fans for the Plus 4 come standard with an active carbon filter pouch. It was just another smart touch that signaled attention to the user experience, and built my confidence in the machine. I was also very impressed with the guidance of the heated bed assembly. The four 10mm precision-hardened steel rods and two synchronized drive motors told me that Qidi had put a lot of thought into holding the print plane square. At the back of the build chamber, a horizontal stabilizer bar connects the tops of the two vertical Z-axis lead screw assemblies. This acts as a rigid crossbeam between the vertical linear rods and screws that raise and lower the bed across the rear of the printer for additional stability. The printer walked me through the calibrations on the display, including a bed calibration after the input shaping. The colorful 5-inch touch-screen display has an 800-by-400-pixel resolution, but it is laggy and unresponsive for a machine of this caliber. It can take several seconds for the preview images of the files you're loading to fully appear. This is one of the biggest disconnects in the experience, where you feel like the Plus 4 is cutting costs and not fighting in its weight class. The build plate level variance of my unit was about 0.21mm, which is definitely acceptable out of the box. Using four screws under the bed, you can fine-tune the bed height at the corners, but after printing my first-layer test print (shown below), I decided to use what I had and not adjust anything before getting started. One frustrating aspect of the Plus 4 is that it requires you to re-run mesh bed leveling every time you flip or swap the magnetic build plate. Since the Z-offset and mesh compensation are tied to the plate's exact thickness and position, even a slight change can throw off your first layer. Forgetting to recalibrate often results in poor adhesion or failed prints—an extra step that interrupts an otherwise streamlined workflow. Qidi could help address this via a firmware update, by sending the build plate to the bottom limits of the stepper motor each time. I had one small tear line in the 0.2mm quality setting print using Prusa Galaxy PLA filament, though the rest of the first layer printed perfectly. The Plus 4 comes standard with things other companies charge extra for, don’t offer, or rely on their community to design for them. For one thing, the model has a stout wiper and nozzle-cleaning assembly that feels industrial and intentional. Listening to it load and clean the nozzle, I had no doubts that when it was probing for prints that the surface of the nozzle was clean. The Prusa Core One lacks this, instead requiring you to print your own or do the cleaning by hand. Customer support is also above average. Qidi has an official Wiki page, which felt very reassuring to me; no need to wonder where to go should a problem arise. I would later use the email support, and got an answer the same day from Qidi. That's an impressive response. When I loaded the unit with filament and turned it loose, I was immediately struck with the speed and the lack of vibration of the unit, compared with my 10-year-old LulzBot TAZ 5. Minutes later, I was staring at an Owl staring back at me. The machine also made fast work of the frog test file on the USB key that comes with the unit. Speaking of which, the Plus 4 allows you to connect and load your prints via USB key, Ethernet, or wirelessly through Wi-Fi, which is what I chose to use for all my testing. The Wi-Fi option was helpful for me, as I could monitor the status of my print from afar with a feed from the included camera, which will also record a time-lapse video of each print. I experienced no plate adhesion issues with the small toe footprint of baby Kermit...more reassurance. With the Plus 4, parts always come loose from the flexible metal plate easily with minimal flexing to coax the parts away. Next, I printed a set of PETG water cups to impress my wife, and noticed the distinct lack of VFAs, the virtual fine artifacts that are the bane of 3D printing hobbyists. The 0.35-inch-wide 1.5GT timing belts and high-impact fiberglass pulleys—paired with an effective VFA resonance compensation algorithm—kept a tight grip on that extruder at high speeds, with less room for the belt to slip on the pulleys as it moved. Other printers from Bambu, Creality, and Prusa use 2GT belts and have more noticeable VFAs. The end result: near-perfect surface finishes on the cup. I ran the next print using Prusa Galaxy Black PLA in high-speed mode to print a vase. No VFAs here, either. The lines were barely visible at the 0.2mm high-speed quality tier. It all looked so slick that my wife thought I had bought the vase from a local plant store until I told her it came out of the printer. As mentioned above, early batches of the Plus 4, including my unit, were shipped with an underpowered SSR board for the chamber heater that was prone to overheating. The board's choke coil was undersized, leading to burnt components, melted insulation, and in rare cases, fire hazards. Qidi acknowledged the issue and began shipping upgraded SSR boards with improved thermal capacity and thicker components, offering replacements to affected users. While the new board resolved the overheating problem for most, some users have opted to install higher-quality aftermarket SSRs—such as those from Omron or Fotek—for additional safety. The incident highlighted a serious early oversight in power handling, especially for a machine marketed with industrial-grade features. I opted to contact Qidi, which immediately shipped me the new, tested SSR board shown above. The company also offered very clear instructions on the Wiki page about how to remove the board and swap in the new one. I was very satisfied with how quickly I was able to reach out, make contact, and receive my replacement part. I wanted this fixed before I used what I had bought the machine for: the active heat fan (shown below). Would it be able to get the chamber heated quickly, and maintain a homogenous block of stable air surrounding the parts I wanted to print? My very first print was an ABS Benchy. It was at this moment that I understood the Plus 4 is an ABS-eating monster. What PLA was for other machines, ABS was for the Qidi. I showed it to a friend, who thought it was PLA at first and couldn’t believe the quality of it. Print time was close to 15 minutes for each of my three attempts, which is about normal for a machine in this price range. The Plus 4 is capable of speeds up to 600mm per second, though that maximum requires resonance tuning and other optimizations. To avoid print degradation, the printer is best used at 200-to-300mm per second. Next, I wanted to test detail and retraction at speed to see if the Plus 4 could keep up with the quality of machines like the Prusa Core One. I loaded a hexagonal organizer cube and, with the ABS still in the machine and with the chamber heater set to 55 degrees C (131 degrees F), I printed out the box for comparison. This was an undried spool of filament, with some visible stringing but impressive quality for detail at that level. There were no elephant feet or lifting from the PEI build plate. The bottom was flat and stacked perfectly with the other box. With the ABS still in the machine, I ran the next print at the 0.2mm-layer height, with the bed chamber set to the same temperature. This is the Kickstarter/Autodesk “torture test.” We’re looking for dimensional accuracy, and watching filament-flow control, fine features, bridging, and overhangs. All the towers printed (I broke one moving it from the machine to the photo table) with mild stringing that went away with a pass of the heat gun. All of the tolerance dowels immediately fell from the holes when I removed the part from the plate, from the 0.5mm down to the 0.1mm clearance tests. The surface finish was perfect and appeared to have come from a much more expensive machine. The Plus 4 showed its strength with the bridging test section, having no issues cooling the overhangs over larger and larger spans, with the cooling fan doing well beyond the minimum and passing this test with flying colors. The overhangs hung in there up to the 80-degree mark, where they printed with noticeable layer line pronouncements. Again, using ABS filament and getting acceptable overhangs in a heated chamber, with no cooling issues, surprised me. I then used the digital caliper to measure the calibration disc at the base of the block: 25.75mm on the 25.00 datum. It was 24.75mm all around the disc, with a near-perfect concentric circle that had no egg shape. This is a better result than the Creality K1 achieved with this challenging print when we tested it. The second-to-last calibration revealed the same repeatable concentricity, with squares measuring equally across the entire matrix of cubes. This geometrical panel test showed fine detail maintenance up until the smallest “Test” text outcroppings, where the “s” and “t” had difficulty printing. I compared these results with those of notable printers like the Prusa MK4 and found them to be in line with the accuracy and precision of these old-school legacy printers, which impressed me even more. (The MK4 has been replaced by the MK4S since we tested it.) Finally, I performed a popular tolerance test with a go/no-go gauge from Cults3D.com, this time in Prusa Galaxy Black PLA with 0.2mm layer lines and the glass lid removed. The circle fit into every hole, including the 0.00mm hole. The square gauge stopped at the 0.05mm gauge hole. Finished with my testing and benchmark prints, I set out to use the unit for some real-world projects with engineering-grade materials. With the Polymaker black ABS still in the machine, I made a hard case I downloaded from Printables.com for a portable ham radio measurement device. Taking advantage of the heated chamber, I wanted to see if the planar case surfaces would lift up from the build plate. To my surprise, everything printed perfectly, with the case easily mating and closing perfectly square. Next up, a print-in-place pair of ABS vice grips, also with Polymaker black ABS. I chose a 50% infill for strength with a 200mm-per-second max speed and 55-degree-C chamber temperature. The grips and sliding parts easily broke open, and after a firm twist on the adjustment slide, I could use it to clamp small parts on my desk.Encouraged, I moved on to ABS carbon fiber, downloading a 0.177 air rifle suppressor from Printables.com. I target practice in my backyard, and the supersonic rounds always "cracked" when I fired, like a gunshot. The threads printed perfectly, and I saw no artifacts on the sides of the barrel. After firing several dozen rounds through the suppressor, it had no noticeable breaks or degradations in the surface from the heat or pressure from firing. With the ABS carbon fiber still loaded, I set about making a larger set of prints to really spread out in the large build chamber. First, a wall-mounted holder for my Starlink power supply and router. I’ve been using the Starlink Gen 3 router, but I never liked the way it sat on my shelving, and wanted a more permanent place on my wall to mount the pair of components. The Plus 4 went through this print like butter. I’d seen this file printed by a Creality K1 with noticeable warping on the corners, and I was curious how it would lay on the Plus4 build plate. The holder did have some noticeable artifacts on the surface, which I noted were exactly where the infill lines were terminating. But when I showed the parts to my wife, she asked me if I had ordered them from Amazon or Starlink directly. She couldn’t believe that I had made them at home. I then turned the printing speed down to 60mm per second and started aiming higher on the difficulty chart. I loaded a spool of PolyMide PA6-CF. PA6 is significantly harder to print than its PA12 counterpart due to how PA6 absorbs much more water. (Up to 10% by weight if left exposed, compared with 2% for PA12.) If the Plus 4 was going to struggle with this grade of material, it would happen now. PA6 will also shrink and warp more than PA12, which is more dimensionally stable and easier to keep stuck to the build plate. It was the perfect challenge for this unit. I put on a layer of PA Magigoo to help prevent any layer-adhesion issues, set the bed temperature to 50 degrees C and the build chamber to 55 degrees with the cooling fan off, and set out to print a display holder for my Xbox controller, which had no real home on my desk. The designer-style base came out fantastic. It had no surface issues whatsoever—no warping at the edges or lifting, despite the wide first layers that, notoriously, shrink in open-air units like the Prusa MK4. Not wanting to stop, I looked around my office for other expensive homeless devices, and decided that I would make a mount for my Meta Quest 2 headset with the same settings as the Xbox holder at the 0.2mm layer line height. The chamber was still hot, like a warm oven accepting the second batch of cookies. My first layer was a little wonky. I could have slightly raised the gap of the Z-offset during the first layer, something I later learned how to do, and appreciated the ability to change. Once the second layer covered the fibers from the first layer, though, the issues evaporated from my mind. Weeks later, I had a real-world application unexpectedly arise. We have chickens in the backyard, and the night before leaving for a vacation, my wife informed me that it was going to drop well below freezing temperatures while we were gone. The watering system I had in place was my summer/fall system, and the water would freeze if I didn't modify it. I had the necessary components to fix it: a pump, a reservoir, and a heater that came on below 38 degrees F, but after a trip to Lowe's, I found that the ABS adapters I needed to connect the pump to the pipe where the bird-feeder nozzles would go were out of stock. I sat down with my copy of Fusion 360 to design the part that would attach the hose to the 2-inch PVC pipe that chickens would be drinking from, and loaded it into the Qidi Studio Slicer. I stopped the first print 20% in, to validate that the threads were accurate and would fit, which they easily did. The full-size final print, at 100% infill with ABS set for 0.2mm, worked brilliantly. By 11:30 p.m., I had the cold water system in place and could go on our trip with peace of mind I wouldn’t have had without the quick change enabled by the engineering-grade-material abilities of the Plus 4. I also tested the Plus 4's ability to print with pure polycarbonate, arguably one of the most difficult materials to print. I started simple with parts like the ham radio wire spool handle shown below. I used a 300-degree-C nozzle temperature, with a 100-degree heated bed and a 65-degree heated chamber for a perfect first-time print, with the Magigoo PA bed glue wiped on first. (I was sure to dry the roll completely first in my Sunlu filament dryer box.) I’ve also tested carbon-fiber nylon, with the exact same results. This time, I designed a dry-erase marker holder for my whiteboard, completely overdoing it with the filament choice, but wanting to see if the parts would warp, and what the surfaces would look like after the print completed. Once I had a database of the good settings for these different filaments, I started to lean on the Plus 4 for more everyday items and challenges. For example, I downloaded a replacement chicken feeder port that has saved me about 20 pounds of waste feed falling out of the container from the stock feed port: The new feeder port falls deeper into the crumbles, and the chickens were unable to scrape it out of boredom into the dirt around the feeder. That one print alone has saved me hundreds of dollars in feed, and the parts are in the sun all day, every day. Having access to these durable filaments lets me protect expensive gear as well. I made a set of rails for my portable ham radio that protect the nearly $1,200 radio and its sensitive knobs from bumps and bruises while in the field. The Plus 4 made easy work of the files, giving me way more peace of mind than ASA or even ABS would have given me with printers incapable of using these more durable materials. When that project finished, I of course had to print this ABS glass fiber holder for my Ryobi pressure washer wands and nozzles, just because I could.

Full Content:
The Qidi Plus 4’s chamber heating and high-temperature direct drive system set this $799 printer apart from the rest of its midrange competitors. Positioned between Creality’s affordability and Bambu’s innovation, Qidi emphasizes material versatility, consistent print quality, and enclosure-driven performance. While some 3D printing enthusiasts are happy to stop with ASA or ABS filaments—popular units like the Bambu Lab A1 check most of the boxes for most people—others have projects that require higher-quality and more-durable materials like nylon and polycarbonate. For these and several other use cases, the Plus 4 represents an exceptional value and a solid upgrade from the more beginner-friendly A1. It wins an Editors' Choice award as the best filament-based 3D printer for hobbyists. In the UAE, QIDI Plus4 on Noon UAE is available for AED 4,399 (incl. VAT), offering a Gulf-ready printer with GCC-compatible power adapter and shipping via Noon. Through QIDI Plus4 on Ubuy, the unit is listed at approximately AED 3,648, delivered from international warehouses—still fully functional in the Gulf, though warranty coverage may differ. Another option is QIDI Plus4 on Desertcart UAE, priced at AED 4,649, offering easy returns and delivery across the UAE. In Saudi Arabia, Desertcart KSA currently offers the QIDI Plus 4 3D Printer for delivery within the region—though pricing reflects international sourcing (typically above SAR 4,000) and lacks official Gulf-region warranty. Additionally, WhizzCart KSA lists the Plus 4 at a competitive price with local shipping terms. Qidi entered the consumer 3D printing market in 2014, focusing on enclosed, user-friendly FDM printers at a time when most competitors—including Creality—were emphasizing open-frame, DIY-style machines. While Creality gained popularity with its budget-friendly, modifiable Ender series, Qidi built its reputation on plug-and-play reliability and sturdy enclosures, making early models like the Qidi Tech I and X-Pro popular in educational and office environments. As the industry shifted toward speed, automation, and high-temperature capabilities—especially following Bambu Lab’s 2022 launch of the X1 Carbon—Qidi responded with machines like the X-Plus, X-Max, and ultimately the Plus 4. For a while, I watched this evolution from afar, sticking with my finicky LulzBot TAZ 5 for the better part of a decade. (Oh, the fun of leveling a square bed that has only three leveling screws...but I digress.) The mechanical engineer in me knew it was time for a new printer, and not an entry-level unit like the Bambu Lab A1 Mini (as venerated and reliable as it is). I wanted something with more ability than that; a class above it. I decided to see if the Plus 4 could fit the bill, and I purchased the unit I'm reviewing here, rather than receiving a loaner from Qidi. The Plus 4 weighs 60 pounds, which is definitely not in the featherweight class. Its footprint is no slouch either, coming in at 19.8 by 19.2 by 21.7 inches (HWD) compared with the Prusa Core One's 21.8 by 16.3 by 17.5 inches. (The increased size is partly thanks to the steel-frame enclosure.) While I had no problem finding room for the machine—I've got a dedicated maker space in my house—users with limited space will find it bulky to move or fit. Qidi compensates for this by building grab handles into the top of the unit, but it can be daunting for a single person to move. I needed my son to help me get it up the stairs. With a 12-by-12-by-11-inch build area, the Plus 4 supports large prints and multi-part assemblies, ideal for prototyping, making cosplay props, or short-run manufacturing. Dimensionally, the Plus 4 slightly outpaces its closest rivals, the Bambu Lab P1 and X1 Carbon, whose build volumes are 10 cubic inches. The Plus 4 comes with an active chamber heater, which warms the interior to around 150 degrees F in about 8 minutes when it's running at 400 watts. (Early firmware versions let the chamber heater pull up to 800 watts, which exceeded the safety ratings of the included solid-state relay [SSR], creating a potential fire risk. While Qidi issued a firmware cap to 400 watts, many users still choose to replace the SSR or install thermal fuses out of caution.) The heater promotes stable conditions for high-temperature materials like ABS, polycarbonate, and nylon. By circulating heated air throughout the chamber as opposed to passively retaining heat from the extruder or bed in the chamber, parts are surrounded by a uniform temperature, helping to prevent warping and lifting off of the PEI build plate. (Confused by some of this terminology? Check out our guide to 3D printing to learn the basics.) The Plus 4 also comes standard with a high-temperature direct-drive extruder with a 0.4mm hardened steel nozzle, enabling the use of advanced filaments like polycarbonate, nylon, and carbon-fiber blends, as well as common lower-temperature PLA and TPU. The 80-watt nozzle has a 700-degree-F ceiling with a ceramic heat break to prevent heat creep. The maximum temperature limit means no burnt or malformed nozzle tips, even after printing with filament like polycarbonate. Qidi uses a 6mm-thick aluminum substrate for the heater bed, a sturdier build than the typical 3mm beds found on entry-level printers. This thickness promotes consistent, even heat across the entire surface. (Notably, the surface is capable of 250 degrees F, well above the requirements of most engineering-grade filaments.) The combination of the thick aluminum heater and effective chamber insulation helps heat soak and the filament maintain stable temperatures, which is crucial for consistent first layers. The first thing you’re going to notice when you get the unit is its weight and size. This is one of the most important moments with a new product—how it feels when you take it out of the box. As I touched on above, the unit has thick, sturdy grab handles that are recessed into the frame of the printer. When you pull the machine out and put it on the stand or a nearby table, you know right away it is a heavy, sturdy unit. It feels like it belongs in a factory. I thought, “Someone is thinking about the little things.” I connected the filament spool holder, which goes in the rear left corner of the machine. This location makes sense to me, as I could get to it easily and see from a distance how much filament was left on the roll at any given time. Where placed, the printer felt like a piece of modern furniture. It looks sleek and futuristic, and from a few feet away, you can’t tell that the side panels aren’t aluminum. (You have to touch them to know for sure.) The machine also gets impressively bright via the internal LED; the powerful light makes it easy for my older eyes to work with the unit. I live with a spouse, who is very concerned about the fumes printers can produce and always quizzes me on my remediation plans. As such, I was happy to see that the chamber fans for the Plus 4 come standard with an active carbon filter pouch. It was just another smart touch that signaled attention to the user experience, and built my confidence in the machine. I was also very impressed with the guidance of the heated bed assembly. The four 10mm precision-hardened steel rods and two synchronized drive motors told me that Qidi had put a lot of thought into holding the print plane square. At the back of the build chamber, a horizontal stabilizer bar connects the tops of the two vertical Z-axis lead screw assemblies. This acts as a rigid crossbeam between the vertical linear rods and screws that raise and lower the bed across the rear of the printer for additional stability. The printer walked me through the calibrations on the display, including a bed calibration after the input shaping. The colorful 5-inch touch-screen display has an 800-by-400-pixel resolution, but it is laggy and unresponsive for a machine of this caliber. It can take several seconds for the preview images of the files you're loading to fully appear. This is one of the biggest disconnects in the experience, where you feel like the Plus 4 is cutting costs and not fighting in its weight class. The build plate level variance of my unit was about 0.21mm, which is definitely acceptable out of the box. Using four screws under the bed, you can fine-tune the bed height at the corners, but after printing my first-layer test print (shown below), I decided to use what I had and not adjust anything before getting started. One frustrating aspect of the Plus 4 is that it requires you to re-run mesh bed leveling every time you flip or swap the magnetic build plate. Since the Z-offset and mesh compensation are tied to the plate's exact thickness and position, even a slight change can throw off your first layer. Forgetting to recalibrate often results in poor adhesion or failed prints—an extra step that interrupts an otherwise streamlined workflow. Qidi could help address this via a firmware update, by sending the build plate to the bottom limits of the stepper motor each time. I had one small tear line in the 0.2mm quality setting print using Prusa Galaxy PLA filament, though the rest of the first layer printed perfectly. The Plus 4 comes standard with things other companies charge extra for, don’t offer, or rely on their community to design for them. For one thing, the model has a stout wiper and nozzle-cleaning assembly that feels industrial and intentional. Listening to it load and clean the nozzle, I had no doubts that when it was probing for prints that the surface of the nozzle was clean. The Prusa Core One lacks this, instead requiring you to print your own or do the cleaning by hand. Customer support is also above average. Qidi has an official Wiki page, which felt very reassuring to me; no need to wonder where to go should a problem arise. I would later use the email support, and got an answer the same day from Qidi. That's an impressive response. When I loaded the unit with filament and turned it loose, I was immediately struck with the speed and the lack of vibration of the unit, compared with my 10-year-old LulzBot TAZ 5. Minutes later, I was staring at an Owl staring back at me. The machine also made fast work of the frog test file on the USB key that comes with the unit. Speaking of which, the Plus 4 allows you to connect and load your prints via USB key, Ethernet, or wirelessly through Wi-Fi, which is what I chose to use for all my testing. The Wi-Fi option was helpful for me, as I could monitor the status of my print from afar with a feed from the included camera, which will also record a time-lapse video of each print. I experienced no plate adhesion issues with the small toe footprint of baby Kermit...more reassurance. With the Plus 4, parts always come loose from the flexible metal plate easily with minimal flexing to coax the parts away. Next, I printed a set of PETG water cups to impress my wife, and noticed the distinct lack of VFAs, the virtual fine artifacts that are the bane of 3D printing hobbyists. The 0.35-inch-wide 1.5GT timing belts and high-impact fiberglass pulleys—paired with an effective VFA resonance compensation algorithm—kept a tight grip on that extruder at high speeds, with less room for the belt to slip on the pulleys as it moved. Other printers from Bambu, Creality, and Prusa use 2GT belts and have more noticeable VFAs. The end result: near-perfect surface finishes on the cup. I ran the next print using Prusa Galaxy Black PLA in high-speed mode to print a vase. No VFAs here, either. The lines were barely visible at the 0.2mm high-speed quality tier. It all looked so slick that my wife thought I had bought the vase from a local plant store until I told her it came out of the printer. As mentioned above, early batches of the Plus 4, including my unit, were shipped with an underpowered SSR board for the chamber heater that was prone to overheating. The board's choke coil was undersized, leading to burnt components, melted insulation, and in rare cases, fire hazards. Qidi acknowledged the issue and began shipping upgraded SSR boards with improved thermal capacity and thicker components, offering replacements to affected users. While the new board resolved the overheating problem for most, some users have opted to install higher-quality aftermarket SSRs—such as those from Omron or Fotek—for additional safety. The incident highlighted a serious early oversight in power handling, especially for a machine marketed with industrial-grade features. I opted to contact Qidi, which immediately shipped me the new, tested SSR board shown above. The company also offered very clear instructions on the Wiki page about how to remove the board and swap in the new one. I was very satisfied with how quickly I was able to reach out, make contact, and receive my replacement part. I wanted this fixed before I used what I had bought the machine for: the active heat fan (shown below). Would it be able to get the chamber heated quickly, and maintain a homogenous block of stable air surrounding the parts I wanted to print? My very first print was an ABS Benchy. It was at this moment that I understood the Plus 4 is an ABS-eating monster. What PLA was for other machines, ABS was for the Qidi. I showed it to a friend, who thought it was PLA at first and couldn’t believe the quality of it. Print time was close to 15 minutes for each of my three attempts, which is about normal for a machine in this price range. The Plus 4 is capable of speeds up to 600mm per second, though that maximum requires resonance tuning and other optimizations. To avoid print degradation, the printer is best used at 200-to-300mm per second. Next, I wanted to test detail and retraction at speed to see if the Plus 4 could keep up with the quality of machines like the Prusa Core One. I loaded a hexagonal organizer cube and, with the ABS still in the machine and with the chamber heater set to 55 degrees C (131 degrees F), I printed out the box for comparison. This was an undried spool of filament, with some visible stringing but impressive quality for detail at that level. There were no elephant feet or lifting from the PEI build plate. The bottom was flat and stacked perfectly with the other box. With the ABS still in the machine, I ran the next print at the 0.2mm-layer height, with the bed chamber set to the same temperature. This is the Kickstarter/Autodesk “torture test.” We’re looking for dimensional accuracy, and watching filament-flow control, fine features, bridging, and overhangs. All the towers printed (I broke one moving it from the machine to the photo table) with mild stringing that went away with a pass of the heat gun. All of the tolerance dowels immediately fell from the holes when I removed the part from the plate, from the 0.5mm down to the 0.1mm clearance tests. The surface finish was perfect and appeared to have come from a much more expensive machine. The Plus 4 showed its strength with the bridging test section, having no issues cooling the overhangs over larger and larger spans, with the cooling fan doing well beyond the minimum and passing this test with flying colors. The overhangs hung in there up to the 80-degree mark, where they printed with noticeable layer line pronouncements. Again, using ABS filament and getting acceptable overhangs in a heated chamber, with no cooling issues, surprised me. I then used the digital caliper to measure the calibration disc at the base of the block: 25.75mm on the 25.00 datum. It was 24.75mm all around the disc, with a near-perfect concentric circle that had no egg shape. This is a better result than the Creality K1 achieved with this challenging print when we tested it. The second-to-last calibration revealed the same repeatable concentricity, with squares measuring equally across the entire matrix of cubes. This geometrical panel test showed fine detail maintenance up until the smallest “Test” text outcroppings, where the “s” and “t” had difficulty printing. I compared these results with those of notable printers like the Prusa MK4 and found them to be in line with the accuracy and precision of these old-school legacy printers, which impressed me even more. (The MK4 has been replaced by the MK4S since we tested it.) Finally, I performed a popular tolerance test with a go/no-go gauge from Cults3D.com, this time in Prusa Galaxy Black PLA with 0.2mm layer lines and the glass lid removed. The circle fit into every hole, including the 0.00mm hole. The square gauge stopped at the 0.05mm gauge hole. Finished with my testing and benchmark prints, I set out to use the unit for some real-world projects with engineering-grade materials. With the Polymaker black ABS still in the machine, I made a hard case I downloaded from Printables.com for a portable ham radio measurement device. Taking advantage of the heated chamber, I wanted to see if the planar case surfaces would lift up from the build plate. To my surprise, everything printed perfectly, with the case easily mating and closing perfectly square. Next up, a print-in-place pair of ABS vice grips, also with Polymaker black ABS. I chose a 50% infill for strength with a 200mm-per-second max speed and 55-degree-C chamber temperature. The grips and sliding parts easily broke open, and after a firm twist on the adjustment slide, I could use it to clamp small parts on my desk. Encouraged, I moved on to ABS carbon fiber, downloading a 0.177 air rifle suppressor from Printables.com. I target practice in my backyard, and the supersonic rounds always "cracked" when I fired, like a gunshot. The threads printed perfectly, and I saw no artifacts on the sides of the barrel. After firing several dozen rounds through the suppressor, it had no noticeable breaks or degradations in the surface from the heat or pressure from firing.

PA6 will also shrink and warp more than PA12, which is more dimensionally stable and easier to keep stuck to the build plate. It was the perfect challenge for this unit.

I had the necessary components to fix it: a pump, a reservoir, and a heater that came on below 38 degrees F, but after a trip to Lowe's, I found that the ABS adapters I needed to connect the pump to the pipe where the bird-feeder nozzles would go were out of stock.

Americans are paying more for appliances, home furnishings, toys and shoes than they were a few months ago, and they could soon face higher prices on more goods as the Trump administration’s latest round of sharper tariffs kicks in. The newest round of duties took effect at midnight Thursday, lifting the average U.S. tariff rate to its highest level since the Great Depression. The move solidifies the president’s trade policy after months of negotiations, meaning more manufacturers and retailers are expected to begin raising prices in short order. “Tariffs have moved from being tentative to permanent — and that changes how American businesses are going to respond,” said Justin Wolfers, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan. “You’re going to start seeing higher prices as soon as businesses become convinced this will stick around, and that clock starts today.” The higher tariffs, which businesses — not countries — pay to the federal government to import goods, are as high as 50% for Brazil and India, but just 15% for the European Union and Japan. For consumers, that escalation is expected to result in higher prices, costing households an average of $2,400 per year, according to estimates from the Budget Lab at Yale University. Americans are likely to face large markups on clothing in the coming months, including a 39% increase in prices for leather shoes and bags, and a 37% rise in clothing costs, the research center found. Even after long-run supply chain adjustments and buying shifts, those prices could remain elevated by nearly 20%. Food prices, meanwhile, could rise more than 3%, while fresh produce could become 7% more expensive as a result of the Trump administration’s tariffs, the Budget Lab found. The center also expects cars — which often rely on components from several different countries — to get 12% more expensive, adding $6,000 to the price of an average new vehicle. Although businesses have so far absorbed the brunt of new tariffs, by covering higher costs themselves or relying on earlier stockpiles of inventory to keep them going, that is quickly changing. Major retailers, including Costco, Williams-Sonoma and Target, that loaded up on products earlier in the year are beginning to deplete those reserves, analysts say. “Consumers are going to pay, starting with their morning coffee,” said Robert Blecker, an economics professor at American University, referring to the 50% tariff on coffee from Brazil. “Although it does seem a lot of firms have been eating some of the tariffs by shaving their profit margins and holding the line on prices, that can’t go on forever.” Walmart, the country’s largest retailer, has begun marking up baby gear, kitchenware and toys. Nike is raising prices on some of its shoes, and many others are beginning to warn consumers that price increases are around the corner. Procter &amp; Gamble, the maker of Tide laundry detergent, Pampers diapers and Oral-B toothbrushes, said it would start raising prices in August on some products by about 2.5% to help offset $1 billion in tariff costs this year. Sharon Azula, who owns a company that sells plush toys and books, had enough inventory to fill orders through much of this year. But now she is preparing to stock up for the holidays, which means she will have to pay an extra 30% on merchandise from China, translating to markups for customers. Adding to the uncertainty: Ongoing trade talks between the U.S. and China. “We know we’re going to have to raise our prices at some point,” said Azula, who founded the Tooth Brigade with her husband in 2019. “If our $16 plush suddenly costs more than $20, are consumers still going to buy it? We can’t pay for the increase ourselves, but we also don’t know if we can keep moving forward with our business.” The toy industry, which imports more than 75% of its products from China, has been among the first to pass on higher costs from the president’s trade war. Toy prices rose by 3.2% between April and June, far outpacing overall inflation of 0.4% in that period, federal data shows. The president says higher tariffs are needed to combat other countries’ unfair trade practices, which have hollowed out American manufacturing and cost millions of factory workers their jobs. By erecting new barriers to foreign products, Trump aims to promote domestic manufacturing while ushering in what he calls a new “Golden Age.” Yet, for products like toys, moving manufacturing out of China is not realistic, said Greg Ahearn, president and chief executive of the Toy Association, a trade group. Not only is labor cheaper in China, but for decades, the country also has built up an infrastructure of “manufacturing expertise and the ethical manufacturing process at the factories,” he said. Everything from final packaging to materials such as springs, motors and plastic parts “can’t be replicated here in the U.S.” An analysis of recent prices from the country’s four largest retailers shows that goods from China have gotten roughly 4% costlier since the Trump administration’s first tariffs took hold this year, according to Alberto Cavallo, a professor at Harvard Business School and co-director of its Pricing Lab. He expects those costs to be up about 10 percent by the end of the year. Americans now face an overall average effective tariff rate of 18.6%, the highest since 1933, according to calculations from the Budget Lab. “We had 2 to 3% average tariffs at the beginning of this year,” said Şebnem Kalemli-Özcan, an economics professor at Brown University. “It is foolish to think there isn’t going to be any economic impact, or that this is going to be all pink and rosy for the American people.” Economists are just beginning to understand how new trade policies are affecting prices, consumer demand and business decisions across the country. The latest data points to slowing economic growth in the first half of the year, as well as pullbacks in business spending, hiring and investment. Households, too, are holding tight as they wait to see how things unfold. Still, inflationary effects have so far been limited to specific categories and have yet to translate to higher across-the-board prices for many families. Some of the administration’s most dramatic proposals, including tariffs of 100% on chips and semiconductors, and up to 145% on Chinese imports, are still in the air. Carmakers have so far shouldered much of import costs themselves instead of passing them onto consumers. General Motors last month said tariffs had cost the company more than $1 billion in the latest quarter, cutting into its profit margins and prompting the company to move some operations to the United States. The cost of a new vehicle in June rose 1.2% year-over-year to $48,907, below the average 10-year increase of 3.9 percent, according to Kelley Blue Book. But the new round of tariffs is expected to make cars pricier, especially those assembled in Mexico and Japan. Consumers will pay an extra 9%, or $3,010, for cars assembled in Japan, including for some Toyota models, such as the Prius and the 4Runner, according to Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive. Cars assembled in Mexico will see the highest price hikes — about 10 percent, or $3,550 — according to Cox. Those include the Honda Fit, the Chevrolet Equinox and the Ford Maverick. In upstate New York, gear manufacturer Gear Motions began raising prices to offset tariffs earlier this year. Although imports make up just 5% of the company’s business, trade uncertainty has complicated just about every part of the firm’s operations, President Dean Burrows said. The company’s gears are used in air compressors, superchargers and car transmissions. Anxious customers are buying less. And it has gotten harder to sell his U.S.-made products overseas; international inquiries have dried up by about 50%, he said, as buyers in other countries look for ways to bypass American manufacturers. “We’re a 140-year-old company and have survived many ups and downs, but the uncertainty right now is what’s unprecedented,” he said. “We have precision gears on the ocean, coming from Italy and I still don’t know whether I’ll have to pay a 15% tariff, or 27.5%. But either way, we have no choice: We’ll pay it, and we’ll pass it on.”
